ebncbjv,t3_a5kd5d,More! What happened? Tell me!!!!,t3_a5kd5d
ebnpib0,t3_a5kd5d,"I love the way you built up the warm atmosphere just to break it down with the twist, a great story.",t3_a5kd5d
ebnq7fd,t3_a5kd5d,"Nicely written. Reminds me of  

### [Coherence (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/) .

&#x200B;

Wish there were more movies having same concept.",t3_a5kd5d
ebnmifg,t3_a5kd5d,I would upvote this more than once if I could! Great writing and I loved the twist.,t3_a5kd5d
ebn5lxr,t3_a5kd5d,Edited for a typo,t3_a5kd5d
eboa6ah,t3_a5kd5d,"I was so nervous that this was gonna have a Gerald‚Äôs Game type scenario, but what you wrote was ten times as terrifying. Upvote!",t3_a5kd5d
eboc6n0,t3_a5kd5d,"Ehh, I get over the loss pretty quickly and then raid a bookstore",t3_a5kd5d
ebnuwnc,t3_a5kd5d,"Since becoming a Christian, I'm terrified of the rapture. 

Sometimes i can go days on end stuck on the family land without any human interaction besides my kids. On such days, i suddenly feel an unease that the rapture may have occurred and i was left behind. 

I always search for my kids when i feel this way, because they're still babies. If they hurr, im good G. ",t3_a5kd5d

eboio2s,t3_a5kd5d,"That was bloody good, man. ",t3_a5kd5d
ectbk2w,t3_a5kd5d,"Maybe everyone is just standing behind you?  


Turn around, Bright Eyes",t3_a5kd5d
ebnftm5,t1_ebncbjv,"Yay I'm glad you liked it! :) I love writing things but always run out of steam shortly into it, haven't got a clue what happens next. Just found the idea of being distracted by something only to discover everything had disappeared inexplicably in the meantime creepy as hell. 

Maybe the rapture? Maybe a glitch in the matrix, and this is the moment you realise you were always the only real person in the universe. The realisation that you are, and always were, alone, you just hadn't noticed it. ",t3_a5kd5d
ebo9tf8,t1_ebncbjv,"Watch The Leftovers, it's basically this concept, the whole idea of the show is exploring what happens after 2% of the world's population disappears.",t3_a5kd5d
ebnpytn,t1_ebnpib0,Thanks üòä I think we can all relate to those lovely calm summer afternoons when everything feels just right. And everyone doesn't disappear. That's always good too. ,t3_a5kd5d
ebnqc0x,t1_ebnq7fd,"Oooh I might have to watch that, sounds interesting! And thanks :)",t3_a5kd5d
ebnzrk8,t1_ebnq7fd,"Yeah, it was an awesome low budget film!",t3_a5kd5d
ebnmr3b,t1_ebnmifg,"Thank you so much, it really means a lot to me to hear :D",t3_a5kd5d
ebor4dq,t1_eboa6ah,Haha Having now looked up Gerald's Game I can say with certainty that it was not at all what I expected from the title.,t3_a5kd5d
ebor68b,t1_eboc6n0,"That would be pretty sweet, I have to admit. ",t3_a5kd5d
ebnvzwu,t1_ebnuwnc,"That actually must be pretty terrifying! I live in a big city so you can never feel alone really, always cars running past and trains and planes and whatnot. Can't imagine that feeling of isolation. ",t3_a5kd5d
ebor6zl,t1_eboio2s,Thanks! :) I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_a5kd5d
ebnuc2r,t1_ebnftm5,I find this follow-up comment more chilling than the actual story.,t3_a5kd5d
ebwpmkc,t1_ebnftm5,"That's 200% more terrifying than the original story. After all, we all fear being alone",t3_a5kd5d
eboqz1a,t1_ebo9tf8,"Oooh I'll look into that, thanks! I love discovering new shows :D",t3_a5kd5d
ebrhzh1,t1_ebor4dq,Only because there‚Äôs a really traumatic eclipse scene where the dad diddles the daughter kinda üò©,t3_a5kd5d
eboszbz,t1_ebnvzwu,"You know what I've always thought was terrifying??

Thinking your a good Christian. And the rapture happening and you NOT ascending. 

Imagine living your life as the Bible says, loving thy neighbor and loving God, only to be left behind in the end. ",t3_a5kd5d
ebnudv6,t1_ebnuc2r,"Yeah I realised it took a pretty dark turn after I posted it haha

EDIT: typos",t3_a5kd5d
ebq0o1y,t1_eboqz1a,"You won't regret it, it's fairly slow but has incredible acting and is so thought-provoking. Definitely my favorite show of all time.",t3_a5kd5d
ebwpqms,t1_eboqz1a,"You can also read The Langoliers by Stephen King. It's about a group of people on a flight but when they land, they discover they are utterly alone, no animals, no humans, only silence. It's really good. The film adaptation was okay, but it really screwed up the most pivotal characters, so I wouldn't recommend it.",t3_a5kd5d
ebr2lm2,t1_eboszbz,Imagine believing in a ‚Äúrapture‚Äù at all. Wild,t3_a5kd5d
ec2m96p,t1_ebwpqms,Thank you for the recommendation! I do like the Stephen King books I've read.,t3_a5kd5d
