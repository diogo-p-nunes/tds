And the formatting looked just fine (I'm mobile, it was very easy for me to read)",t3_9tbuzb
e8v2q9k,t3_9tbuzb,"Attempted to edit it to adjust formatting (line breaks) to make it a little easier to read, but nothing I do seems to work. How do I Reddit?!",t3_9tbuzb
e8wue8t,t3_9tbuzb,"Very chilling. Liked it. To be honest, I don't mind about any of the fomatting on any of these stories - I just like the rich and varied content I see every day.  Sometimes the worst scares are from the shortest and worst grammatical pieces.  Don't sweat it - your idea for your story is brilliant.",t3_9tbuzb

Yeah, the formating looks so much better on mobile. The line breaks on the desktop version are tiny and no amount of carriage returns and extra spaces seemed to change that. Ah well.",t3_9tbuzb
e8vi2aa,t1_e8v2q9k,"great story. plus the format is good, it only took me a couple of seconds to get use to it.",t3_9tbuzb

I'm probably just a stickler for formatting, to be honest. I like things to be spaced a certain way but Reddit always clumps things up together very tightly. ",t3_9tbuzb
