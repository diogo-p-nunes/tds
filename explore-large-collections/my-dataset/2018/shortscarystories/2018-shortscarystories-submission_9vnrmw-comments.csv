e9fh5kh,t3_9vnrmw,You did a really good job.  You laid out a creepy story with a heartwarming and comforting message at the end. ,t3_9vnrmw
e9dnpv6,t3_9vnrmw,"Hi all, please let me know how I can improve - especially if you didn't like it. I want to improve my writing and I'm trying to figure out if I need to think of better plots, flesh out my stories more, etc. Thanks! ",t3_9vnrmw
e9e5s4z,t3_9vnrmw,"I really like it! The only note I have (and it's just an opinion, really), is that the line about your ancestors keeping you safe seems really offhanded until the very end, like it doesn't belong. Maybe if, before you walk down the alley, you touch a necklace or something that reminds you of your ancestors to kind of tie it in so it doesn't seem so random when your mom mentions it.",t3_9vnrmw
e9l82no,t3_9vnrmw,Is this based on a true story? Because i read a story similar to this in a newspaper years ago.,t3_9vnrmw
e9fil36,t1_e9fh5kh,Thank you so much! ,t3_9vnrmw
e9drtl6,t1_e9dnpv6,I really liked it!  Especially the last sentence!  That was the perfect way to end it!  Great job!!,t3_9vnrmw
e9efpfh,t1_e9e5s4z,I've edited it - she tugs at her necklace in the first paragraph and her mother adds another safety charm to her necklace after the incident. Hope this is fine ðŸ˜Š,t3_9vnrmw
e9eeytq,t1_e9e5s4z,"Thank you!

Yes, the line would seem off - it's used often in my place, so I hadn't thought much of it. I'll change it. Thanks! ",t3_9vnrmw
e9m5imh,t1_e9l82no,"Really? Can you please give me the link or some keywords to search for? If it has happened then it's amazing! I've never come across any supernatural incidents in real life.

Two of my friends are tall and muscular. I used to walk in between them and during those times, I used to feel so protected! More than I would like to let them know ðŸ˜› I had the courage to go out at night with them. One has moved to another company and the other has got a girlfriend now and has a busy schedule. So we haven't been able to meet regularly. This story came out of that and a horrific incident in a city where a girl was brutally murdered - another girl was spared because she didn't get on to that vehicle. The driver and his friends were out that night searching and they had decided to grab one girl, but luckily she got into another vehicle then. The victim wasn't lucky,unfortunately. Such incidents are just horrific. 

I will try searching for the article. Please let me know if you find it. Thanks! ",t3_9vnrmw
