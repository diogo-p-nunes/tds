However the entire story is two sentences, both of which seem to run on fairly long. It gives it a rushed feel that I don't think allows for a build up or real sense of dread. It's not a terrible concept, I'd just try re-writing it with the sentences broken up and more descriptive language.",t3_9sk2lh

Edit: It wonâ€™t let me for some reason any solutions??",t3_9sk2lh
