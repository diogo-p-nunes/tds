eanmyqs,t1_eanknq8,">Then, I saw a balloon. White in colour, gracefully floating in the sky, giving off an aura of freedom and light in a sea of darkness. It gave me hope. It was inanimate, but it seemed ... happy. It was happiness in its most pathetic form, but it felt as if gaining it would at least give my life some meaning. For a moment, having that balloon was my only desire in the entire world. I went to grab it, almost in an act of reaching for my very soul inside that balloon. But, looking down, I saw its string in the hand of a young girl, around three years old. That's it. I couldn't stand it.

So she cut off her hand? ",t3_a18gw7
