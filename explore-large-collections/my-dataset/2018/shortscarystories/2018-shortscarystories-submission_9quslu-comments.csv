e8dzjxx,t3_9quslu,"Good story! When did the mom pass? Somewhere between killing the draft dodger and the police visit?

That next to the last paragraph could use a little rearranging so that it scans better. More direct, less passive. 

>I watched the police inspector bag the rest of the bones excavated from our back garden. The pumpkin seeds from that night sure had thrived. Pops stood stoically ... We both recalled her car breaking down ... Even then, we weren't thinking how, once again, our family name plummeted to the dirt. 

I (personally) prefer it broken up into sentences rather than a single run-on sentence. I imagine you're trying to make it all a simultaneous thought, but it's harder to read.",t3_9quslu

e8n1zp9,t1_e8dzjxx,"Hi, thanks a bunch! Yep, I imagine OP now a grown man coming back to support his aging father through it, so I guess mom kept it a secret all those years.


Greatly appreciated the feedback :)",t3_9quslu
