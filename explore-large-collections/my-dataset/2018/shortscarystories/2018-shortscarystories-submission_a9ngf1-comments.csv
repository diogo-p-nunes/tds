ecl06v8,t1_eckzy4o,"Thanks for the comment. I tried to hide the twist until the end, with leaving little oddities along the way, so if you read the story for a second time, you notice these little things. Not sure I managed to do that, but I hope I did.",t3_a9ngf1
eclizb1,t1_eclifxk,"The parasites can spread via close contact of the host and another human being. If the host is close to more people, the parasite has a better chance of spreading.
