e9uh3e8,t3_9xmiiz,"Um, I like it, but I think that you need to flesh out the climax more with details and strengthen it.  The climax of the story left me feeling that there has to be more to it.  There was to me too many unanswered questions at the end too;  for example, what happened to “Sophie” when she escaped into the woods.


You might write it longer, and when “Sophie” goes into the woods have a scene or a chapter where the next day other kids find her and then they go to the sheriff of the county and they lead him/her and other police there to the body.",t3_9xmiiz
e9v8f3a,t1_e9ty1du,Not No sleep and not wholesome at all. She murdered ber e tire family ,t3_9xmiiz
e9u871f,t1_e9u3g5g,"Ooh ha ha that's quite a compliment, I love this subreddit! Thank you though! :)",t3_9xmiiz
e9v8tk8,t1_e9v8f3a,"Wholesomenosleep specifically says it's not just for nosleep. As for your other point...I mean that's subjective. We don't really know what happened. Imo the ending is pretty wholesome, and at least 11 other people agree with me *shrug*. ",t3_9xmiiz
e9u8ery,t1_e9u871f,Nothing has given me goosebumps like this did! I love it! You’re very welcome!!!,t3_9xmiiz
e9vcy07,t1_e9v8tk8,"Millions of people agreed wiyh the holocauat so thats irrelevant. I will concede I don't venture to wholesomenosleep often enough to know all the rules, my bad in that one. 

And rhe ending Tbh is sad. It sounds like the narrator is too afraid to talk any other way. 

We know exactly what hapoened: every time they used saying around the bottle, it reacted. They said one too manyvsaying and the 3 adults suddenly spontaneously combusted? Killed. They ded. Authorities wrote it iff because it couldnt be explained meaning it was supernatural in nature. 

All in all a sad story imo",t3_9xmiiz
e9vdbzu,t1_e9vcy07,It's a story dude. I'm free to interpret it differently than you. As are other people. I hardly think it's comparable to *the Holocaust*. Have a good day. ,t3_9xmiiz
e9vuunv,t1_e9vdbzu,Never said you had to interpret it same as me. Am I not also free to fisagrwe with you?,t3_9xmiiz
e9wdt4k,t1_e9vuunv,"Sure, but that doesn't mean I gotta listen to you lol. ",t3_9xmiiz
