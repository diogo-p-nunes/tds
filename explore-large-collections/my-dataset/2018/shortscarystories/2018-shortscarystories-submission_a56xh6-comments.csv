ebkpv1q,t3_a56xh6,"Reminds me of the worst video I've ever watched where the brick flies through the window and kills the woman in the passenger seat.

Edit: I'm not linking, let alone **searching** for that video.",t3_a56xh6

eblmiwi,t3_a56xh6,Waaaaaaiiiiittt.... So I'm thinking of this guy doesn't want to die and decides to let his daughter take the wheel EVERY TIME LOOP... And thousands times later he's still keeping it going...,t3_a56xh6
ebkqp2n,t1_ebkpv1q,"That was part of the inspiration. I've never watched it myself, it's too awful.",t3_a56xh6
ebkvqst,t1_ebkpv1q,Fuck that video.,t3_a56xh6

eblmqth,t1_eblmiwi,"It's more like the mother is stuck in a time loop with their  (teenage, in my mind) daughter, reliving her death over and over. The time loop is only about 15 seconds.

But I like your take, too!",t3_a56xh6
eblibdt,t1_ebkqp2n,"You don‚Äôt even see anything gory if I recall correctly. You just watch the block come through the window hear the screams. I don‚Äôt know how, but I think it‚Äôs even worse that way.",t3_a56xh6
eblifb5,t1_eblcav2,[deleted],t3_a56xh6
eblf4jv,t1_eblagu2,Stop you‚Äôre scaring me,t3_a56xh6
eblmw15,t1_eblmqth,I know but I just automatically take a darker path whenever I read a story :p,t3_a56xh6
ebliizb,t1_eblibdt,"I think that's worse, too. I can handle gore, but I do *not* want to hear the screams.",t3_a56xh6
ebmjlo7,t1_eblibdt,"Because we've all seen pretty realistic gore in TV and movies, but we're not accustomed to hearing **real** screams of pure anguish and horror. A family was driving along like any family has done a million times and within a heartbeat, the mother's head is just gone. I can't even imagine. ",t3_a56xh6
eblrzat,t1_eblifb5,"Fucking use google, how many videos like this do you think are out there?",t3_a56xh6
ebtbn75,t1_eblmw15,"Well first off, the narrator definitely says **both** the words, ‚Äúbra‚Äù and ‚Äúregret‚Äù so idk where your ‚Äúdarker path‚Äù is coming from but it sure ain‚Äôt this story. ",t3_a56xh6
ebol0ei,t1_ebmjlo7,"Even when the gore is real, it doesn‚Äôt compare to the horror of someone who was alive suddenly not being there. I was in an ER a while back and saw a guy with a good portion of the skin on his chest and arms ripped off. I‚Äôve seen two gory car crash aftermaths in person. This one is more minor, but I shadowed a dermatology surgeon and watched her cut people‚Äôs faces apart to save their lives. Real damage to bodies is a bit frightening and very gross when you‚Äôre actually standing there to see it.

But it‚Äôs funny we should come to this topic today. Fateful, almost. My dog died unexpectedly sometime late last night of what we think was a heart attack. He was just 7 years old, very sweet and he was like a member of the family. My parents came into my room this morning to tell me and it felt like the world came to a halt. When they went into my sisters room to tell her, she screamed. She wailed, and it was a sound so wracked with grief and pain it broke me down to my core. That noise had more of a profound effect on me than any of the blood or wrecked flesh I‚Äôve ever seen. There‚Äôs something so much more viscerally devastating about the loss of a loved one than anything else in the world. The dog‚Äôs body was intact, he looked almost peaceful, but seeing that the life was gone from him made it feel like my soul was being sucked into the ground.

He was a good dog and I loved him deeply, but he was just a dog in the end. In that video it was someone‚Äôs mother. The dread and pain I felt today were some of the heaviest I‚Äôve ever experienced, but it couldn‚Äôt have been a fraction of theirs. This comment got a little long and maybe incoherent, but given the things I‚Äôve felt today that video has grown so much more poignant. Show those you love that you love them, before it‚Äôs too late.",t3_a56xh6
eboujip,t1_ebol0ei,I hope your good boy didn't suffer. I'm very sorry for your loss. Pets truly are like family.,t3_a56xh6
ebpbe7a,t1_ebol0ei,"Shit man, I'm so sorry to hear that. My 5 yr old good boy means the world to me so I can only imagine what you must be going through. I hope you and your sister can come through this okay.",t3_a56xh6
ebourr9,t1_eboujip,Thank you <3 we think he went about as peacefully as he could have.,t3_a56xh6
ebpx6wn,t1_ebpbe7a,Thank you. We‚Äôre doing our best üíô,t3_a56xh6
