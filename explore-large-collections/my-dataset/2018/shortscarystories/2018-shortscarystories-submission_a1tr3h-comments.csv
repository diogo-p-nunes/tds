easz96h,t3_a1tr3h,"The way you worded 'Norma even got our first child' kind of threw me off. I was expecting it to be something/someone she stole and that was why everyone was staring.

It's really good, though. I like the vagueness at the end",t3_a1tr3h
eat1el0,t3_a1tr3h,"love the band, love this story :) creeeeepy",t3_a1tr3h
easo6zb,t3_a1tr3h,"Sounds SUPER GOOD, maybe you could add a littler more to the end like why they didn't want them to leave, maybe a cult or satanic thing? The suspense of what could happen is killing meee. Great read though!!",t3_a1tr3h
eatpchi,t3_a1tr3h,Norma or Nora? But good story!,t3_a1tr3h
easzv6v,t1_easo6zb,Haha thanks. I was trying to go with something vague so there is that element of suspense. What could/did happen? I don't know. Kind of felt like it was a diary entry almost. ,t3_a1tr3h
