e9x7wui,t3_9xywil,"As soon as I saw this was about selling meat, I knew there would be cannibalism involved.",t3_9xywil
e9whidu,t3_9xywil,I liked the way you've described the scene! ,t3_9xywil
e9xldyv,t3_9xywil,Having a person survive being carved up for meet feels even more horrifying than if they died.,t3_9xywil
e9xqx2q,t3_9xywil,"So descriptive. One thing though, the plot twist carried on for just a bit too long. overall had a very fun time narrating this one (9/10)",t3_9xywil
e9xon0s,t3_9xywil,I don't get it...,t3_9xywil
e9xr95i,t3_9xywil,I expected the human meat part but not her actually getting away from the butcher,t3_9xywil
e9x5l8p,t3_9xywil,Fantastic ,t3_9xywil
e9xrwbz,t3_9xywil,This had a great flow to it. Very well told even if I caught on quick about the cannibalism. Poor Nancy.,t3_9xywil
e9x876d,t1_e9x7wui,"I was actually cooking a flat iron steak, marveling of the marbling in the meat. 

“Hey!” I wondered, if a cannibal would do the same thing.",t3_9xywil
e9whxas,t1_e9whidu,Thanks! ,t3_9xywil
e9xluz8,t1_e9xldyv,"There's no telling what was in store for Nancy's horrific future. There have been some truly heinous survival stories from victims of serial killers, but at least they're stories of survival. ",t3_9xywil
e9xra7w,t1_e9xqx2q,"Yea after I wrote it out it was a tad over 500 words. I should've taken better care of the final product. Still, thank you so much! I'm glad you liked it.",t3_9xywil
e9xq80e,t1_e9xon0s,"Guy orders some steaks, Butcher is a serial killer that uses humans for ""Choice Cuts"" to sell at his shop. Girl, Nancy, smacks him with a mallet, and barely escapes. And is helped by the man that was unknowingly buying human sirloin.",t3_9xywil
e9xrijc,t1_e9xr95i,Yea that fact that there's a Butcher in a scary story it points pretty quickly to cannibalism. So there had to be something else than just what everybody seen coming. Thanks for checking it out!,t3_9xywil
e9x638p,t1_e9x5l8p,"Thanks for checking it out! I'm glad you liked it.

&#x200B;",t3_9xywil
e9xs3cb,t1_e9xrwbz,"Thanks! I said earlier that scary story + butcher = cannibals. So for a twist that everybody sees coming, it better be good. Thanks for taking a look!",t3_9xywil
e9xhbsx,t1_e9x876d,"Yes, we would.",t3_9xywil
e9xqyfw,t1_e9xq80e,"Ah, makes sense. Thank you. ",t3_9xywil
e9xv52d,t1_e9xrijc,"You're welcome and I'm glad for the twist, made it a good read!",t3_9xywil
e9zrbym,t1_e9x638p,I saw the title and wasn't disappointed ,t3_9xywil
e9xhva7,t1_e9xhbsx,"I've been trying to pull together a good roast for a birthday coming up, any tips? ",t3_9xywil
e9xr6ci,t1_e9xqyfw,"No problem, man.",t3_9xywil
e9xj176,t1_e9xhva7,"Take the meat from the lower back, a nice rump roast. Heat some olive oil in a roasting pan, sear that bad boy on all sides. Add some red wine, beef broth, and thyme. Bake at 350° until almost tender. Then add pearl onions and chopped potatoes and carrots. Cook until tender. It's to die for.",t3_9xywil
e9xk4fm,t1_e9xj176,"So you cook it like a beef roast? All these ""Human meat is just like pork."" people are full of shit. ",t3_9xywil
e9xv54x,t1_e9xj176,To die for indeed.,t3_9xywil
eaj19kr,t1_e9xj176,I prefer a nice Chianti ,t3_9xywil
