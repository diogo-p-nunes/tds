ec8nmen,t3_a7zj44,"I do this little trick all the time as well. Closing my eyes just enough to appear asleep, but not enough to obscure my vision completely.

I continue to do this today, as a 24 year old, even after noticing the creatures. You know the ones I'm talking about. Those who creep in the shadows, those you would never notice while awake and with eyes wide opened. I've been watching them for a couple of years now, while I'm pretending to be asleep. Although, I feel like they have noticed the several times my breathing got way too heavy at night. Not breathing heavily due to fear, but simply out of excitement, out of feeling of superiority over them. It's almost funny at times. 

I hope the one watching me right now, from the farthest point my peripheral vision can reach, cannot understand what I'm typing.",t3_a7zj44

ec7lny1,t1_ec79tox,He's from Sweet Home Alabama and married his mom,t3_a7zj44
ec7qhqo,t1_ec79tox,"That's okay! :D You can either think of it as his mom possesses his wife every night to make sure he's asleep, like she always does; or the wife is in cahoots with the mom to always make sure he slept at a reasonable time.  The main point was to have someone watching ~~you~~ him while ~~you~~ he slept :3",t3_a7zj44
