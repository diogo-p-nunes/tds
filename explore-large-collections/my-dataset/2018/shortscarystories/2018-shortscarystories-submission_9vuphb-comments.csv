e9fmxu0,t3_9vuphb,"Good concept, but it felt like a giant run on sentence. Maybe that was intentional given that it's a dog, but if this dog can write and post on Reddit, he should be able to punctuate properly ;)
Just my two cents :) ",t3_9vuphb
e9f6y7v,t3_9vuphb,This isn't scary it's sad,t3_9vuphb
e9kzalj,t3_9vuphb,"I personally liked this story. It was sad, but also scary. I could feel the fear and confusion from the dog. Honestly, the story being run on sentences and very short,  added to the fact that it’s a dogs perspective. Good job OP",t3_9vuphb

e9g3neb,t1_e9fmxu0,Yeah sorry my grammar and puncuation isn't that  good I'm trying to work on it any other suggestions.,t3_9vuphb
e9f7sro,t1_e9f6y7v,How about this imagine being a dog and some monster kills you human how do you feel I'm not trying to be mean and I get that it's sad but isn't it alittle scary,t3_9vuphb
e9l3mcs,t1_e9kzalj,"Thanks it means alot I put alot of effort,time, and thought into it. I was thinking and I liked the udea of demons I have a pond that can be alittle scary because there could be anything down there I hated the idea of a dog dying so I reversed roles. I was thinking about an alternate ending or sequeld but I'm not sure what do you think. I had inspiration from the sad and scary story series wanna play which the first part can be found on creepsmcpastas youtube channal or the creepypasta website.",t3_9vuphb
e9hlwwh,t1_e9h63xc,"Dude what the heck this is my first time posting here and I'm not that good with grammar and punctuation.
 If your going to comment either say it's good or say it needs work and then say the issues and solution for example:

 It needs period here (insert part) and maybe change this (insert part) to (insert suggestion).

I'm fine with you not liking it but if you don't like it don't be rude about just point out problems and suggestions.

e9kz2xw,t1_e9h63xc,Why are you being a dick. Don’t like the story? Then leave. No need to be rude. ,t3_9vuphb
e9lasfk,t1_e9l3mcs,"I’m not sure how you could do a sequel, but you could do the story from the humans perspective. That way you can flesh out the story more, and give a different insight to what went down. It could even be a full story, with this one hyperlinked at the end (when the human is sucked into the pond). Also, for help with your grammar and such, I’m always willing to lend a helping hand, and look over before you post it. ",t3_9vuphb
