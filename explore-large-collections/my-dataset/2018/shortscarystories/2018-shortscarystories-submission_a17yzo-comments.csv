eangxz1,t3_a17yzo,"I'm sorry, I'm not following the gist of this.  I get that the screaming woman was the problem, but are we meant to infer that she was calling the dragon?  Was the dragon a red herring?  Why did the warrior know to kill her and not the dragon?",t3_a17yzo
eaqw9ho,t3_a17yzo,"Yeah I don't get it at all.. it's really not clear. It's too bad because your writing style is quite good, it's just not clear what the ending of the story is all about.",t3_a17yzo
eapvijd,t3_a17yzo,"Still don't get it, despite reading 3 times. ",t3_a17yzo
eanhab4,t1_eangxz1,Read the clues! Hihi,t3_a17yzo
eart1ll,t1_eaqw9ho,"Thanks, I actually agree, it's quite unclear. I was hoping someone would get the correlation between the title and what happened after the dragon arrived.",t3_a17yzo
eart6ij,t1_eaqw9ho,"The dragon was the woman. 

The woman was the dragon.

She was a shapeshifter who wanted to scare the people and steal their riches.

That's why I mentioned that the rich fled emptyhanded.

And that's also why the warrior only killed the woman and the people lived happily after that.

Ocean's 2, the title, is a nod to Ocean's 11. 

Since they are two creatures in one, I made the title Ocean's 2. ",t3_a17yzo
eanhfe4,t1_eanhab4,"That's part of the problem.  I can't tell what the clues are!  It's most likely on me, though, if I'm honest.",t3_a17yzo
eat9nmw,t1_eart6ij,I think that if you try to make stuff like that clearer it will be a nice story. I really like the idea of it!,t3_a17yzo
eanhlr1,t1_eanhfe4,Read the title and then read the story again! Hihi,t3_a17yzo
eatv234,t1_eat9nmw,"Thanks, will do better the next time. ",t3_a17yzo
eanhxar,t1_eanhlr1,"I mean, the most I can interpret is that the two women are/were related....hehe, sorry, I don't mean to make your story look bad or anything because I can't figure it out. XP",t3_a17yzo
eani2ln,t1_eanhxar,"It's okay, I like giving people a hard time. ",t3_a17yzo
