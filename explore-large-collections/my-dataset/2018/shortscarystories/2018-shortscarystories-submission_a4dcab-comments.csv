ebeuugc,t3_a4dcab,"Wonderfully written, this could be expanded into a novel or even the premise for a film",t3_a4dcab
ebfhnv4,t1_ebeuugc,"Oddly enough, it was based on a stageplay I had heard of but never read or seen.

A guy I knew described a one act he did about two Cossacks stationed together in the middle of nowhere all Russian winter long, going crazy through boredom. It ends in a fight with sabers.

Problem is, I couldn't remember the title, the details, or who it was that told me about it in the first place. So I had to write my own version.",t3_a4dcab
