Great story",t3_9uoirr
e96huxx,t3_9uoirr,Great job with this! The idea of God drinking on the job at Corporate is hilarious and would explain a lot (platypus?).  Poor little girl though. üò©,t3_9uoirr

Wow.",t3_9uoirr
e9656l9,t3_9uoirr,I love this. I‚Äôd read a whole book about these too. Reminds me of Gaiman or Discworld. ,t3_9uoirr
e95zgmi,t3_9uoirr,Oh my god this is awesome!! üëè,t3_9uoirr
e966wv2,t3_9uoirr,Wow! This is excellent - I just feel sorry for the little girl though. Very original ,t3_9uoirr
e97in52,t3_9uoirr,Dunno why but I thought this was gonna be about The Sims for a second,t3_9uoirr
e9as3g4,t3_9uoirr,"I said 'Guava juice' , not 'Gas the Jews'.

e982igo,t3_9uoirr,"Love it how they're just following orders, no matter how wrong.  Great work.",t3_9uoirr

e96udnb,t3_9uoirr,Amazing!,t3_9uoirr
egj5rrv,t3_9uoirr,"This is intriguing. Is it truly GOD that these beings work for? Or are they actually some high-tech aliens who think their leader is God? As a Christian (yes, go ahead, make fun of me), it's always been drilled into me that God is the ONLY one who can bring back the dead, not even angels can do that. Of course, this could be a different version of God. Especially if He confused Hitler's wish for juice to mean ""Jews"". This version of God even SORT OF reminds me of Chuck from Supernatural. Gets drunk, makes dumb mistakes, ends up trying to fix it, more mistakes happen, but it all ends up okay.

Oh, and who is Corporate that they have power over GOD? Very interesting.",t3_9uoirr

e97a7n8,t1_e971n5z,"The entity named ‚ÄúGod‚Äù in this story is not the same as the God of any particular religion. Note that this God lacks omniscience, drinks on the job, and answers to ‚ÄúCorporate‚Äù. This God is presumably the inspiration behind some elements of Christian and Muslim belief, but the raising of Lazarus may be embellished if not entirely false.

Edit: none of this is meant as a comment upon real world theology; I‚Äôm talking exclusively about this story. Just trying not to step on any toes.",t3_9uoirr
e97z5ja,t1_e97vi8k,Not really,t3_9uoirr
e965ytz,t1_e963nim,Do you know who ‚Äúthey ‚Äú is? ,t3_9uoirr
e966l1t,t1_e965ytz,Some sort of higher power. Sometimes little details should be left to the reader. I think this is one of those cases where you need to decide who 'they' are for yourself,t3_9uoirr
e9ascds,t1_e965ytz,"Angels, I think",t3_9uoirr
e967llp,t1_e966l1t,"Ok thank you for taking the time to explain it to me. I was thinking they were wish granters, but I thought I was missing what kind they were. ",t3_9uoirr
