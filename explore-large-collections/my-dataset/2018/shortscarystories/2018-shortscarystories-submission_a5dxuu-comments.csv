ebm50q8,t3_a5dxuu,Wow. This is so sad. Very classic Twilight Zone.,t3_a5dxuu
ebmaj04,t3_a5dxuu,"Wow. I think that’s up there with Quitter’s Inc. for me. I’m a smoker, all the horror stories about smoking are true. Great tale!",t3_a5dxuu
ebmburg,t3_a5dxuu,"Great story! I like the slow build-up and the payoff at the end punched me in the face.

Off topic, but a leech is not an insect but an annelid (segmented worm).",t3_a5dxuu
ebmznkt,t3_a5dxuu,[deleted],t3_a5dxuu
ebm66et,t3_a5dxuu,I love it! I want more to the story!,t3_a5dxuu
ebm7w1i,t3_a5dxuu,How does this not have more upvotes?? This was done so well I absolutely love this story.,t3_a5dxuu
ebnfz39,t3_a5dxuu,"A nice ending also would be to have his kid starting to smoke in his adolescence, and his father catching him smoking right at the end of the story (and with the dad at peak aggression, tragedy)",t3_a5dxuu
ebm5o3n,t3_a5dxuu,"Sorry, but I don’t understand that ending (Not trolling!!! It’s really good, just don’t understand the twist)",t3_a5dxuu
ebmhpkq,t3_a5dxuu,Good stuff. I’m not going to lie; I was definitely expecting the father to end up doing something horrible to the son,t3_a5dxuu
ebmpw4l,t3_a5dxuu,Your creativity and writing style literally almost remind me of Stephen King. Especially his work in the Night Shift. This is such a creative concept ! Great job! ,t3_a5dxuu
ebndqys,t3_a5dxuu,Very well written and descriptive. Only issue I had was there was no mention by Max or otherwise that the creature would or could replicate. ,t3_a5dxuu
ebvv9kf,t3_a5dxuu,"i thought it was going to skip to the future and the baby was going to be a smoker and he was gonna kill him, glad it wasn’t that because the ending was so much better than my idea ",t3_a5dxuu
ebm0gro,t3_a5dxuu,Poor Benji,t3_a5dxuu
ebmb5id,t3_a5dxuu,read this while having a smoke.. had to put it out after feeling a bit guilty,t3_a5dxuu
ebmmefd,t3_a5dxuu,"Awwww, no OP!",t3_a5dxuu
ebmrvod,t3_a5dxuu,"From the moment he said they  “feed off of feelings of attachment”, I was like aww man.  I knew what that meant",t3_a5dxuu
ebmsrij,t3_a5dxuu,"Amazing, love the concept! ",t3_a5dxuu
ebn1heg,t3_a5dxuu,This is ace! but the description at the start just made me really want a fag 🤣,t3_a5dxuu
ebncvbz,t3_a5dxuu,"Have you read George R R Martin's short story ""the monkey treatment""? Check it out , its a version of this story with food as the addiction and its marvelously macabre.",t3_a5dxuu
ebnjhor,t3_a5dxuu,"I saw where this was going and I was not disappointed. Fantastic, chilling story!",t3_a5dxuu
ebzym5p,t3_a5dxuu,Well done and really creative :) I especially liked how you used the same senses to describe his love of cigarettes and his love towards his kid.,t3_a5dxuu
ecavvu0,t3_a5dxuu,This is good.,t3_a5dxuu
ecphdw5,t3_a5dxuu,"Damn, should have just vaped lmao ",t3_a5dxuu
ebm195i,t1_eblxz25,"I have to second that. I had to go back and re-read what Max said about their feeding habits but then I was like damn, that’s an interesting idea! It’s certainly unique. ",t3_a5dxuu
ebly0x6,t1_eblxz25,Thank you!,t3_a5dxuu
ebmgvmj,t1_ebm50q8,">Wow. This is so sad.

alexa play despacito",t3_a5dxuu
ebmbqoa,t1_ebmaj04,Thank you! Quitter’s Inc is brilliant so that’s definitely high praise.,t3_a5dxuu
ebmclhr,t1_ebmburg,Ah I had a feeling some of the details were off (I’m not even sure if there are leeches in Ethiopia lol). And thanks!,t3_a5dxuu
ebpgw4q,t1_ebmznkt,"I think it's because he was extremely attached to Benji to the point he tried giving up smoking even using the leeches, or maybe it's just for plot convenience but it's good either way",t3_a5dxuu
ebm6p89,t1_ebm66et,"Cheers! Might be worth expanding for NoSleep, who knows.",t3_a5dxuu
ebmbcxd,t1_ebm7w1i,Many thanks!,t3_a5dxuu
ebm67yq,t1_ebm5o3n,"The leech feeds off of feelings of attachment. The father feels attached to his child, hence the leech feeds off of that feeling too, making the attachment to the child revolting to the father.",t3_a5dxuu
ebooh9f,t1_ebmpw4l,Thanks so much for the kind words!,t3_a5dxuu
ec4o5w4,t1_ebndqys,Maybe he didn't know,t3_a5dxuu
ebz9e9o,t1_ebvv9kf,"Damn, I actually really love your ending idea. Would’ve been a great full-circle twist.",t3_a5dxuu
ebmc29q,t1_ebmb5id,I’m usually more of a social smoker but smoking while reading short stories actually sounds like a pretty neat experience haha,t3_a5dxuu
eboofga,t1_ebncvbz,Just looked it up and shall definitely be checking it out!,t3_a5dxuu
ebop1sd,t1_ebnjhor,Thanks!,t3_a5dxuu
ec1kx8n,t1_ebzym5p,Many thanks!,t3_a5dxuu
ebp90wi,t1_ebm6p89,It definitely would!,t3_a5dxuu
ebm6qsd,t1_ebm67yq,I had a feeling that'd happen,t3_a5dxuu
