Hope you liked it anyway!",t3_9s7l2k
e8mqf5b,t1_e8mp7n4,"I enjoyed it. I particularly like your description- very creepy!

If you’re trying to improve your writing, doing a similar short task every day can be really good for developing your skills. It really helped me notice certain things about my writing- like how all my sentences were a similar length. The best bit of advice I ever got was “show, don’t tell”. If you can show the reader an emotion rather than tell them, it’s more effective. 

Hope I don’t sound too critical, I genuinely think it’s great! I just know that sometimes suggestions from people can feel more relevant than trying to read about techniques for improving writing.",t3_9s7l2k
