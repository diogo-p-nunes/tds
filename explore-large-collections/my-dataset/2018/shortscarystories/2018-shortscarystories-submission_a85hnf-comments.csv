ec88kr7,t3_a85hnf,"I'm a woman and I'm not entirely sure I know what you mean by ""pee-fear"". You mean not wanting to sit on a gross toilet? If it's that, I assure you, men can have it too. So much so in fact, that I've known guys who rather take a bush that actually use a public restroom and hold it in as much as they can to wait until they get home.",t3_a85hnf

ec8x1jz,t1_ec88kr7,"I actually meant the weird phenomenon where you know there's someone in the other stall and something makes you want to hold it until you're gone because the sound of urine in a toilet is cavernous and loud, lol",t3_a85hnf
ec8x48b,t1_ec8cq0h,Glad to hear it!,t3_a85hnf
ec8x6j9,t1_ec8eimo,Scariest ever actual experience? I stopped at a rest stop bathroom in CT and there was a spider the size of my palm building a web on the wall.,t3_a85hnf
ec996w2,t1_ec8x1jz,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was that. Some get it in urinals too but is not the majority so you're right that it's mainly a girl thing. I don't care but I can relate if it's ""poop-fear"" instead. XD

How's the eye doing? Keep it well hydrated!",t3_a85hnf
