ecpvyf7,t3_a9fcm8,Excellent job at 10 years old! Keep up with your writing and who knows where it will take you. :) ,t3_a9fcm8
efhac0y,t3_a9fcm8,Just wanted to tell you I think you're writing is incredible (not just for your age) and I'm very impressed! I hope to keep seeing your writing on here and if you ever want writing advice I'm available. :) ,t3_a9fcm8

eciwao2,t1_ecisynm,"Very interesting concept! The advice I'd give to you, since I think you're capable of it despite your age, is to give your readers more credit and give them a twist to figure out on their own without stating it explicitly. In this story the way you could do that is by implying the protagonist became a monster rather than telling the reader outright that he did. 

Keep experimenting with your writing, I'd love to continue reading your growth on here!",t3_a9fcm8
ecn2lqb,t1_ecisynm,"If you're really ten I'd say it's not only a really good short story but with how old you are now if you enjoy it you could probably get pretty good at it, maybe not a professional but it'd be a great hobby.",t3_a9fcm8
