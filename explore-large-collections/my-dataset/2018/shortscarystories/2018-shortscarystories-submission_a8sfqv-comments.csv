ecdcvzu,t1_ecdadvn,"Hey! Thanks man! This scenario actually got stuck in my head the whole day when I was at the office. Phones are not allowed inside, so I just committed this to my memory. I forgot about it when I got home, but then I saw dirty kitchen knife in the sink, and immediately remembered about it. I had to rush writing this so I wouldn't forget again. I'm sorry about my English — it's not my first language. Btw thanks again!",t3_a8sfqv
