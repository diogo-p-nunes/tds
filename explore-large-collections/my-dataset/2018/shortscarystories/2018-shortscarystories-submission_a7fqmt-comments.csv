ec2t0xf,t3_a7fqmt,This is amazing. The way you made a innocent ( or as innocent as it is) nursery rhyme into  something quite creepy is brilliant in my opinion. ,t3_a7fqmt

ec2p1mw,t1_ec2m7t3,"There was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile,

He held a crooked pricket in a crooked, frightful style.

He caught a crooked child by his crooked yellow blouse,

And they all went together to a little crooked house.

In all seriousness though, I think it's very fun to creepy-fy nursery rhymes and I tried to keep it as vague as possible to let people fill in the gaps of the story. Mr Slick is supposed to be an ominous figure, and Jack is the unfortunate victim.

I hope that helped to clear things up a bit? :)",t3_a7fqmt
ec2wqfg,t1_ec2t0xf,Thanks! Honestly I don't think nursery rhymes are all that innocent in the first place haha,t3_a7fqmt
ec376to,t1_ec2sjgi,He's a mean one... pretty sick.,t3_a7fqmt
ec2p3mf,t1_ec2p1mw,It really is! Like you are giving it a double meaning. ,t3_a7fqmt
ec2zo9g,t1_ec2wqfg,Some of em were down right fucking **dark**. Some of the original Grimms were pretty dark...,t3_a7fqmt
ec2wspi,t1_ec2wqfg,Neither do I honestly. ,t3_a7fqmt
ec2p8iu,t1_ec2p3mf,Thank you! I try,t3_a7fqmt
ec3ckjx,t1_ec2zo9g,"Not only the Grimms, but Hans Christian Anderson as well. In his original Little Mermaid, the prince does not love her and the mermaid dies. Or The Little Match Girl, who freezes to death. He was one dark dude.",t3_a7fqmt
ec375iw,t1_ec2zo9g,"Incredibly so. It's surprising when I think back to my childhood how dark some of the stories we grew up with were, even if they were the less twisted original versions.",t3_a7fqmt
