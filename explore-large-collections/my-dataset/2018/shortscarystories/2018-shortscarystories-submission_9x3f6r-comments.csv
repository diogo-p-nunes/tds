e9pevrp,t3_9x3f6r,I love your style!,t3_9x3f6r
e9pf619,t3_9x3f6r,Horrifying but so brilliantly written ,t3_9x3f6r
e9pqeaz,t3_9x3f6r,"So first, To be completely transparent, I am a bit of a zombie aficionado.

Your story, right at the heart of my favorite genre, was extremely well written. I enjoyed your descriptions of the environment, the wonderful building  of the atmosphere, and a great dialogue.

It was intriguing to try to understand if this island the two protagonists were stranded upon was the only infected area left, left for dead in an on rescued state, or just one short swim from salvation.  

In the end, like any good zombie story, I enjoyed the way you told of the last bit of desperation against an unbeatable and unrelenting enemy. Brilliantly done.",t3_9x3f6r
e9q08yb,t3_9x3f6r,"Please please please write more. I mean it. Your imagery, clear mood, and descriptive and figurative language is so amazing.",t3_9x3f6r
e9qti8y,t3_9x3f6r,"Wow, this is bleak!! Very well written - I could almost feel the winter on my skin with the snowflakes coming down.  Could see the river and hear it too.  Excellent.",t3_9x3f6r
e9s2t1d,t3_9x3f6r,Really nice ,t3_9x3f6r
e9qfva0,t3_9x3f6r,"I gotta say, buddy, I'm not quite sold on this story. This feels like another variation of every other zombie survival story I've read here. Also, and please don't take this the wrong way, your grammar needs some work. Other than that, the premise was great and the ending was not bad at all. You have potential as a writer, and if your username is any indication, you're pretty creative, so keep it up!",t3_9x3f6r

e9pqxha,t1_e9pqeaz,"Thanks! That really means a lot. I'm glad I was able to give the genre something more than just a thesaurus of gore. That, and  I was tired of seeing the horrid amount of poorly written stories that plague most of the subs on the site. ",t3_9x3f6r
e9q5b8m,t1_e9q08yb,"Thank you so much! It really means a lot. And believe me, I’m trying to write more, I just posted one called Theodicy, I think it’s on the same level of writing. Again, thank you so much.",t3_9x3f6r
e9r9alf,t1_e9qti8y,Thank you! I’m glad you liked it.,t3_9x3f6r
