1) Mother wanted you dead, and decided to frame Martin, as he was already a criminal, so she lured Martin to the apartment under the guise of talking about how he raped you, from there he was later arrested.

2) To deepen the illusion of Martin commiting the crime, Mother fake framed Andreas by placing the mask on his head. She knew that the police would find the DNA in the mask and Andreas would go free, but this way it looks like Martin tried to frame Andreas.

To summarize, Mother brought Martin to the apartment, framed him, then made it look like Martin framed Andreas.",t3_a3no34
eb7nj9x,t3_a3no34,"The only thing missing is:  whose hands match the finger marks around her neck?  That may well be the answer on who killed her.

",t3_a3no34
eb7to4t,t3_a3no34,"Hmm. So, all three characters have pretty good alibis. The mother is a woman, the brother wasn't wearing a mask, the rapist had no clear motive (note that, if the homicide detective considers him important, he was at least \*accused\* , and shutting her up now wouldn't do much). So maybe it's a forth person?  
There is a fourth person.

""My murderer staged it as a suicide by hanging me from my ceiling fan, but I was not depressed and I had never had suicidal thoughts. ""

Not, notably, ""but I didn't kill myself"".

My theory- Andreas strangled Maja, non-lethally, before collapsing drunken outside (we know he's physically abusive). Maja, who has a very good reason to hate all three suspects, put the mask on andreas (he seems the one she's most angry at in the narration) and hung herself, in the hope that the police would realise it wasn't a real suicide and arrest him. If not, they'd arrest her abusive mother or rapist, also a win.

The mask doesn't contain Andreas' DNA, and we can assume it doesn't contain Frans or the Mother's (as they would have checked). But who would have thought to check for \*Maja's\* DNA in the killer's mask?

The security camera is the only issue, but something doesn't add up about the tape- a security camera in the house would presumably have seen at least whether the killer lives in the house. And besides, ""silhouette""? It sure seems like the tape was too dark to see much clearly. Maybe Frans isn't as much as a red herring as we thought- a man like him in his mask was in the room, and then he was outside the house. If he attacked Maja, or threatened her, or both, and then she was strangled by her brother? That may well inspire such a major act of revenge.

in conclusion- *Maja* killed Maja, staging it as a suicide. The point of the story is to trick the readers into accusing one of the scapegoats, thus completing her revenge.

(also, more OOC, i *really* liked this one- it's pretty unique,  and the oddly clinical way the protagonist describes her own death used really amps the creepiness up a lot.)

&#x200B;",t3_a3no34
eb80do7,t3_a3no34,"My short answer is that Jonah did it. Here is my theory as to why:



Jonah reassures Maja that the mother has no intent to murder any of her children, just that she wants that money from their insurance policies and wished that she could kill them and get that. Jonah therefore knows that there is in fact insurance money to be collected in the case of one of the kids’ deaths. The mother is also described as a drunk, which I take to mean she wouldn’t have had the wherewithal to think to hang Maja from the ceiling fan after strangling her, nor the coordination and possibly the strength (this would be difficult for any person to lift a body, I think!). Furthermore, the person on the camera was that of a man’s profile - so this confirms for me that she was not the masked person.



As for Andreas, Maja mentions that he had no qualms about attacking her on a regular basis; whose to say that that DNA evidence under his fingernails isn’t from a prior event, where she defended herself from his hits before? There’s also no DNA evidence of his in the mask that was worn by the person on the tapes - in fact, on the assumption that all three of the main suspects were tested for DNA evidence, not one of them had DNA evidence inside of the mask. However, they would not think to test Jonah, who was an unlikely suspect. He is also found outside of the apartment, passed out with a vodka bottle. Was he ever in the apartment to begin with? Perhaps he is only used for the alibi for his mother because he is the favorite and he would do anything for her, including lying to be her alibi (mother just tells the truth that she was asleep and uses an alibi for an extra protection, not necessarily to cover up a murder). 



And lastly, Frans is the least likely answer for me personally. This is based on the fact that only Maja knows that he raped her; despite her threats, she never went to the police and he’s a SERIAL rapist, who’s caught very soon after her murder. Of course the detective would think that he did it! Especially because of the mask access, the profile match on the tapes and his criminal background. But if he committed a murder, why would he hang around the area and go after a different victim not even an hour after murdering Maja? Why would he bother to make it look like a suicide after? 



Conclusively, I believe that Jonah was also sick of being starved and sacrificed one of his own siblings in order to get a better life for himself and his baby sister. It’s never once stated that Jonah cared for Maja, even though it’s clear that Maja loves Jonah. Perhaps Jonah thought it was better for Linnie to have access to a life without pain rather then Maja who’s already suffered enough. He knew there were video cameras in the house so he couldn’t frame his mother, but definitely his brother. Anyone can buy a mask at a store. And he already knew Andreas would be a very likely suspect based on his background with abuse. He also knew that the dad would be out when this scene went down - so now he still has one parent that is cleared and can still care for the family, with this extra insurance money that the father can collect to help support them all.



OP, how did I do? Also, AMAZING story - I really loved working through this one!! More, please!!",t3_a3no34
eb7pxtw,t3_a3no34,"If they tested for DNA on the inside of the mask, they would have gotten DNA matches for if Martis wore the mask, since his DNA would have been in the system for a match.  

If the silhouette was a man, it couldn't have been the mother unless she had a particularly manly appearance, but that's not mentioned, so I assume it isn't her.

With Martis, Andreas, and the mother eliminated, it only leaves Jonah and the father. Perhaps Jonah snapped and couldn't deal with it anymore, and killed Maja in an attempt to frame the mother and the big brother so he and Linnie, at least, could live peacefully. ",t3_a3no34
eb82y6x,t3_a3no34,"Okay so I think the structure of this is important, it starts with the mom and for that I think she is complicit maybe even going so far as to encourage your dad to kill you for that “insurance money” the night of your death she must have fallen asleep with atleast the idea. 

So far we have dad missing, your mom sleeping and you and Jonah none the wiser... 

Next up you mentioned the serial rapist, his history is pretty disturbing but his role in this story seems to be two fold, his access to masks being huge and his resentment towards you another. Could your dad have approached him knowing he is the key to hiding his identity? Could he have gone out for himself to do the job? If the case is the latter, he could have chickened out and dropped his mask (which could have many users thus having a muddled DNA profile) when he realized someone had already broken in. Who is the identity of this mystery man? Well we can’t know because our serial rapist dropped his mask and left and around 30 mins after you passed, he was arrested for assault of an unidentified person. Location is everything here and he just so happened to be outside your apartment. 

Our last actor that’s been named is Andreas, Andreas the drunk... stumbling home with a hand occupied by a bottle of vodka. Andreas has a history of violence and a habit of coming home late which lines up with how you were killed in your sleep. Andreas already inebriated picks up the mask, his dark thoughts and possible hatred of you swirling with the alcohol. So he enters the house and sees your body, the result of a plan already hatched with the perpetrator nowhere to be seen and with no signs of struggle. He doesn’t realize you had already been killed but the alcohol dulls his restraint and he can’t leave you lying there so he inadvertently stages the suicide with the intent of finally murdering you, explaining the DNA under his fingernails, before stumbling outside and passing out. 

So who did it? or was it more than one person? 

We have two unaccounted actors throughout this ordeal mentioned only in passing, your dad and your other brother Jonah. 

He said your mother couldn’t be that desperate but what if she had made your dad desperate but not desperate enough to have your blood on his hands. 

So he convinces Jonah, ever the son looking for love from his cruel mother and with intimate knowledge of where the cameras are in the house (as to evade them) sneaks into your room and strangles you. 

In that trauma, Jonah leaves you where you were and returns to sleep. 

And no one in life is the wiser to his deeds because again, Andreas comes in and finishes the job whether he knew it or not, to put the focus on you, Maja - rather than your own family that had come together and broke your body and soul. 

So the answer is no one single person had killed you alone. 

They all did. ",t3_a3no34

""At first it was ruled a suicide until they found markings on my neck. We had security cameras in the house but the killer was masked.""

An officer did an investigation, declared a death a suicide without checking security tapes to just see exactly what happened?

The mortician was the one who found the markings and raised the flags.

The new homicide detective might be in on it as well. If a death is declared a suicide, and the initial report doesn't say ""we checked the security footage"" when there was footage, that would be a massive red flag, and should probably get the initial officer onto the suspect list and/or fired.",t3_a3no34
eb7x9vo,t3_a3no34,"Did all of them work together? Everyone could do their bit towards the murder and be alibis.

So many traumatizing events piling up like that probably induced a psychotic break, and while her conscious, rational mind would ""never want to do that to my siblings"", her sub conscious, damaged, and broken mind just wanted all the suffering to stop.  It's got nothing to do with being depressed or not, and more to do with a child in a situation they shouldn't ever face.

My current theory:

The man with the past conviction did the murder and then planted the mask on the drunk, passed out brother.

Brother, still drunk, wakes up a little, goes in and sees the body. He's thinking the mother did it, so he makes it look like a suicide. Then he goes back outside without realizing the mask is on his head due to how drunk he is ",t3_a3no34
eb7te6l,t3_a3no34,"The three main suspects may have just been that- suspects. The police would have checked the DNA of each inside the mask.

The killer knew about the CCTV because they wore a mask-  which suggests that they were a family member.

Strangulation takes physical strength- the victim has to be overpowered. As girls are often the same size approx. as their mothers AND the victim was twelve (which is the time that girls often achieve their adult height), it is possible that the mother wouldn't have been able to overpower her daughter. Also, although Andreas couldn't have provided an alibi (being passed out drunk), this suggests a man committed the crime.

The father was 'not home' at the time of the crime; he could have snuck back, murdered his daughter and, on the way back out, then tried to frame his son by putting the mask on his head. (The fingernail DNA traces could have been from hitting the victim earlier). Perhaps he hated Andreas and Maja and needed them out of the way for some reason- possibly to protect his wife.

The only thing I (think I've) got is that I'm pretty sure Andreas strangled her. Yes, he was physically abusive so he could have just hit her to explain the DNA, but that doesn't feel right. 

I've known my share of angry alcoholics, and one thing I know is that you don't have to be physically there for them to become angry with you. If he already had a penchant for getting violently angry with her for speaking up about where the money was going, I think that he could have easily riled himself up while she was sleeping, gone into the room, and done the deed.

What I don't know is who found her and strung her up, prepared for the cameras.

I did notice that she said she DIED from the strangulation, and THEN it was staged with the fan. I'm sure the words could be twisted to mean whoever left the finger marks didn't kill her with them, but that also doesn't feel right. I think at least two people were involved, one who put their hands around her throat, and one with a mask and a rope.

The ""but"" should be removed. ""But"" signifies that the text after it is contrasting the first part of the sentence and this does not do that. It's like you wrote ""I really like chocolate but I liked this chocolate cake.""

The whole part about the child rapist is confusing. If you threatened contacting the police when he raped you, he would have killed you then, no?

eba60se,t3_a3no34,"Hey.  I think it was Jonah; let me explain.  

Why would there be cameras in your house?  Your mom couldn't afford it.  Andreas wouldn't want to have evidence of his abuse towards you.  Your dad has nothing to gain from cameras being in the house, but Jonah does.  

Jonah installed the cameras, perhaps telling you it'll allow the two of you to catch Andreas abusing you and that you two could use the video to put him behind bars.  It was actually so he could hand a video of the murderer to the police.  

He waited for a night when your dad wouldn't come home.  This way, your dad couldn't unravel the plan Jonah had for your mother and Andreas.  On that night, he wore a mask, walked through a camera's field of view, and strangled you.  

He staged your death as a suicide so that your mother couldn't claim insurance.  He didn't think she deserved it.  He also slipped the video of the murderer into police custody.  This would start a secret investigation of the family.  By the time your family knew it was a murder, the insurance claim was probably no longer attainable.  

After he staged your suicide, he then waited outside for Andreas to come home.  You see, if you were gone, he was going to be the next target.  He couldn't have that, so he had to get rid of him.  As Andreas was coming home, Jonah knocked him out and planted the mask seen in the video on his body.  When the cops finally realize it was a murder, they'd put two and two together, take Andreas away, and Jonah would be safe.  

His plan backfired though.  Your mom and Andreas conspired to keep each other out of jail.  The cops suspected your mom but ""she was sleeping"" according to Andreas.  The cops suspected Andreas came home drunk and killed you, but how could he both be a reliable witness and a drunk murderer?  The cops discounted the possiblity that Andreas was drunk because he was able to confirm your mom's alibi.  No one was arrested, and Jonah is the new punching bag.

And with no dna on the mask, they would never be able to pinpoint who did it. But... if we speak of dna, it would have had similar dna to the brother if the dad were to have worn it... but wait!!!

ebdek2e,t1_ebdaskr,"It seems it would have been impossible to come to the logical conclusion that Jonah had such a big part in this, the story made it sound like he was a good guy or at least neutral. I think when you’re writing stories like this you have to put clues and hints in the story so that we can play detective and piece what happened together and make guesses based on that. Anyone who would’ve guessed Jonah would’ve been guessing right out of their ass because there’s nothing in the original story to implicate him. So instead of murder mystery solving it becomes just a total crapshoot, just throwing out there any random story to explain what happened. Just my two cents...",t3_a3no34

ebi8m9s,t1_ebi8abm,Let's see!,t3_a3no34
ebjpknl,t1_ebjgzs2,Sure! I have posted the Answer in the story so you can see it now!,t3_a3no34
ejxlk8h,t1_ejw8hki,"Sure!
Here is the answer.  My mother strangled me for insurance money. Andreas who was her favourite child came into the room and caught her in the act. My mother was drunk and she didn't know what she was doing. Andreas was for once sober and knocked her out. I knew he didn't like me much but I guess he didn't want me killed. I was already dead when he came so he staged it as a suicide so my mother would not get money. He was so depressed after so he got drunk and passed out. Mother woke up still drunk but a little soberer. She took the mask that she was wearing found Andreas and put it on him. She later blackmailed him into being an alibi. She said that if he did not confirm that she was asleep she would get him imprisoned. He did as she said and no one was put away for lack of evidence, all while I was watching from Limbo.",t3_a3no34
ebdkoj8,t1_ebdixlo,Good luck. Can’t wait to read it,t3_a3no34
eb7ohxa,t1_eb7ngi8,Could it be a plan of her and her younger siblings?,t3_a3no34
eb7u6h1,t1_eb7u1ae,"The DNA in the mask wasn't ran against Maja's DNA though, it was ran against Andreas', though that's true that the DNA in there would have been a partial match against Andreas' if it was a family member. ",t3_a3no34

eb80jdq,t1_eb80eop,😂😂 that’s very inconvenient ,t3_a3no34
ebiazwx,t1_ebi8m9s,"The mother was the mastermind, Andreas killed her but afterwords drank himself into oblivion. The mother then called the father, who was the cop, to cover up the whole thing. ",t3_a3no34
ebk007p,t1_ebjpknl,Thank you!,t3_a3no34
ebdkpwx,t1_ebdkoj8,Thank you!,t3_a3no34
eb7oli4,t1_eb7ohxa,Do you think it was?,t3_a3no34
eb7u97f,t1_eb7u6h1,It definitely should've been run against Maja's. That's shoddy police work,t3_a3no34
ebaoy7u,t1_ebaou7s,I will tell the awnser Tomorrow at 19.00. If no one cracks the case!,t3_a3no34
ebkg2xl,t1_ebk007p,Your welcome!,t3_a3no34
eb7p987,t1_eb7oli4,"As a result, the mother would either get arrested, leaving her siblings with their dad or the family would receive money which could be spent on food (what ever is left after buying the alcohol). 

Perhaps they hoped that the dad would finally leave their mother. 
I think she and her siblings planned this.",t3_a3no34
eb7uwnd,t1_eb7u97f,"On the inside of the mask, I'm not so sure. But it was a Mexican family in Texas, of course it was shoddy police work.",t3_a3no34

ebbc597,t1_ebaoy7u,!RemindMe 20 hours,t3_a3no34
eb7pm16,t1_eb7p987,It would be logical to sacrifice her but I don't think that the siblings could deal with the emotional pain after all that they had gone through.,t3_a3no34
eb7vagr,t1_eb7uwnd,How do you know it was a Mexican family? The last name is Johansson. Sounds Swedish to me,t3_a3no34
ebaycml,t1_ebax9m2,Your welcome,t3_a3no34
eb7w8au,t1_eb7pm16,Waiting for someone to crack it so I get the answer,t3_a3no34

eb7wxft,t1_eb7wt37,I think the rapist. But i'm just straight forward looking at the text and think he has the most motives.,t3_a3no34
ebd372p,t1_ebamn2n,The real me is from Sweden so I took Swedish names. The daily is from Texas though.,t3_a3no34
ebf6h2x,t1_ebe1esw,Could you pm me the answer then?,t3_a3no34
eb7xd2d,t1_eb7wxft,He does have motives! But are they strong enough? Wouldn't the police have known if his DNA was at the scene?,t3_a3no34
ebf7b0a,t1_ebf6h2x,Yes!,t3_a3no34
eb7xgvw,t1_eb7xd2d,Simply because he's called Martin. Fuck Martins.,t3_a3no34
