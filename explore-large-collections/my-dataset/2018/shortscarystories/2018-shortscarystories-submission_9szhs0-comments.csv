e8shsgz,t3_9szhs0,this was really rushed and I’m not a writer so excuse me if it sucks,t3_9szhs0
e8tgpjb,t3_9szhs0,"Restating what earlier commenters have said, but this is an excellent concept. Genuinely unsettling. At the risk of sounding patronising, for someone of your age, the writing is better than above average too. Wish I could have come up with something so original when I was in the 8th grade. Keep it up, and great work! ",t3_9szhs0
e90oav9,t3_9szhs0,"Captain, I am very impressed with your story. It's a great starting story for *anyone* not just an eighth grader. I hope that you start to find reading more enjoyable. Perhaps if you read some of the short story collections in science fiction, horror or mystery, maybe they would pique your interest in reading, and lead you to new ideas. (And, they really do help build your vocabulary.) Good luck in your writing. I look forward to reading your next story. ",t3_9szhs0
e8te1ws,t3_9szhs0,Would love to keep reading. Could see this as a longer story. ,t3_9szhs0

e8sji3m,t1_e8shsgz,"I think it's an awesome idea, and one I'd love to see explored more. If you haven't, you should really read the short story ""The Jaunt"" by Stephen King. ",t3_9szhs0
e8tdbin,t1_e8shsgz,"It's great! Small thing--did you maybe change your mind about how long the narrator was dreaming before editing? Because right now the years don't match.

>**I’ve been lucid dreaming for 200 years**

>Let’s start over, 400 years ago I was put into a cryogenic chamber...

>Now at the 200 year mark, I’ve completely given up.

Oh man, I just read in a later comment that you are a kid! I had no idea! This is easily above average quality for this subreddit, and I say that as a fan of the subreddit. 

Don't stop writing! ",t3_9szhs0
e8tq9in,t1_e8tfamk,My exact thought.,t3_9szhs0
e8sus22,t1_e8sji3m,I love to write sci-fi like horror stories but I’m only in 8th grade and I hate reading so my vocabulary isn’t very big and my grammar isn’t great either which is why I don’t write stories too often lol. I’ll definitely check it out though as Stephen King is an awesome writer.,t3_9szhs0
e8tudlw,t1_e8sji3m,"Woah. Just checked out the plot summary and this part “One woman was even shoved alive into eternal limbo by her husband, stuck between two Jaunt portals after he shut them both down” scares the crap out of me. ",t3_9szhs0
e8sqdob,t1_e8sji3m,I loved that story,t3_9szhs0
e8tuiei,t1_e8sji3m,"“It is theorized that while physically the process occurs nearly instantaneously, to a conscious mind it lasts an eternity. One is simply left alone with their thoughts in an endless field of white for what is suggested to be possibly anywhere from hundreds to billions of years.” Im liking the whole plot for this book, I might just give it a read. Even though I don’t like to read this genuinely intrigued me.",t3_9szhs0
e90nmme,t1_e8sji3m,"Thanks for suggesting ""The Jaunt."" I read it last century, and had forgotten the horrifying implications of ""things that could go wrong"" during teleportation.",t3_9szhs0
e90nnhl,t1_e8sji3m,"Thanks for suggesting ""The Jaunt."" I read it last century, and had forgotten the horrifying implications of ""things that could go wrong"" during teleportation.",t3_9szhs0
e8ti5ka,t1_e8tdbin,Lmao I forgot to edit that my bad,t3_9szhs0
e8syn3k,t1_e8sus22,"This is an excellent story idea for an adult, let alone an 8th grader! If you hate reading, have you considered non-traditional books e.g. graphic novels, comic books, short stories?",t3_9szhs0
e97t498,t1_e8sus22,"Reading is a great source of inspiration and perfect examples of various writing techniques. You remind me a bit of myself at your age, just don't quit writing like I did, kay? No bullshit, you have talent. ",t3_9szhs0
e8tdz0v,t1_e8sus22,"Very good for your age! I’ve read stuff on here by adults that wasn’t half as well written or engaging, you say you’re not a writer but you’ve clearly got talent. ",t3_9szhs0
e8tug81,t1_e8tudlw,"You can find the PDF pretty easily, I'd suggest reading it. It's not that long. And it's good!",t3_9szhs0
e8sv116,t1_e8sqdob,Thanks! I’ve been playing fallout 4 nonstop lately and that’s where I took the inspiration from,t3_9szhs0
e8trkm9,t1_e8sv116,lol the second you said cryo chamber thats exactly what it reminded me of! good story btw,t3_9szhs0
e8thp61,t1_e8sv116,I love it even more now that I know Fallout was your inspiration. Great job!,t3_9szhs0
