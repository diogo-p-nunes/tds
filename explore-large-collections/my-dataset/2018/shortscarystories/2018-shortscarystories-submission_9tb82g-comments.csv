ef6usuo,t3_9tb82g,"I’m laying on soft sand watching the seabirds float overhead like alien craft.  The air feels so heavy to me; laden with water like you could wring and extract the juices.  That and the heat make my body feel so languid… so languid that I end up gazing for ten minutes just to see if two cloud shapes will collide.  But by the time they might, one has basically dispersed.

Behind it all, there’s the ever soft crunching. It comes from all around somehow.  Maybe matted leaves being chewed by some ruminant?  But I don’t see any animals like that nearby.  Maybe it’s the sound of rocks churning in the surf.  The palm trees swaying with coconuts.  I don’t really know what it is.  Oh well…

&#x200B;

And then… What… What was I saying?

I feel like I was just... somewhere else...

&#x200B;

Shadows of stained glass are projecting down on me; blue, yellow and crimson.  They land on my bare midsection, turning lines into curves.  I lie in bed looking down at my stomach which... is so muscular now.  More than I remember. That’s kind of strange.

A woman circumambulates casting sultry smiles my way. Skin glistening and dressed like a genie.  If it weren’t all right before me, I might call it a cliche.

And there’s a sound, like the crunch of feet pacing in snow, only louder. Maybe it’s more like celery stalks breaking.  I wonder what it could be?

&#x200B;

I’m laying on a strange metal table.  An undulating mound of flesh and hair gnaws at me.  I have no legs and my belly seems to be half gone.  The movements of his mouth coincide with this crunching noise I can hear.  The whole thing is just so bizarre and hilarious that all I can do is laugh.  My body half erupts with the chuckling.  This makes the creature look up.  It stares at me with these weird black and yellow eyes.  I try and stifle it, but the way it’s looking at me makes me laugh even more.  It lifts up this silly looking barb shaped appendage, all covered with hair, and inserts it into the sloppy flesh of my abdomen.  I see it pulse, like it’s filling me with liquid.  And…then.  And… I uh...

&#x200B;

..Um..

&#x200B;

I don’t have to move a muscle as the bartendress walks over with a tender smile and hands me my tequila sunrise. All splayed out on a beach chair with the smell of tanning lotion wafting past my nostrils.  There’s this loud crunching noise.  It must be ice being crushed for more drinks!…

I exhale and let out a long ‘ahhhhhh…’

&#x200B;

I don’t think I’ll ever leave this place.",t3_9tb82g

e9ct69a,t1_e9bm38p,"No, he just invented this machine that lets him enter other people's minds in their dreams, so he plants himself inside the dreams of a girl he wants.  This essentially allows him to control her mind by making her think she desires him, (or something like that).  That was the idea anyway.  Obviously it didn't take the world by storm, but anyway, I enjoyed writing it.  Thanks for the comment!",t3_9tb82g
