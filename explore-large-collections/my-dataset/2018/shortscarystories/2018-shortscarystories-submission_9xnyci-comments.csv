e9txr8c,t3_9xnyci,"The ending was a bit hurried but, other than that it was funny ",t3_9xnyci
e9u5otf,t3_9xnyci,"Not quite sure how they transitioned from,  Iâ€™m assuming regular food, to veganism, to cannibalism ",t3_9xnyci
e9u2bho,t3_9xnyci,Honestly the ending was a bit predictable. ,t3_9xnyci
e9ukl0n,t3_9xnyci,The title alone is enough of a horror story,t3_9xnyci
eb0xtcc,t3_9xnyci,I figured they were already cannibals....That last bit sort of threw me off. lol,t3_9xnyci
e9torco,t3_9xnyci,Please let me know your views on the story and please suggest improvements ðŸ˜Š,t3_9xnyci
e9v1mox,t1_e9txr8c,"Thank you! I didn't know how else to end, so ended with just one line. ",t3_9xnyci
e9v1lk9,t1_e9u5otf,"Oh, sorry about that - Lucy comes over and starts preaching about vegan food. They are imposed vegan lunch for that day. Then the host decides to cook her instead of a turkey. So they transition from non-veg to cannibalism. ",t3_9xnyci
e9v1m8k,t1_e9u2bho,"Yes, I thought the title itself would give away. Sorry about that. ",t3_9xnyci
ebd1no6,t1_eb0xtcc,"Ah, sorry about that - I guess I didn't develop the story much",t3_9xnyci
e9vc1gh,t1_e9v1m8k,Don't be sorry. It's very good. That was just my criticizism. ,t3_9xnyci
e9vcn1b,t1_e9vc1gh,"That's good feedback - so thanks! Taking your feedback, I've written another story where the plot isn't so predictable (atleast for me). Waiting for the 24 hour rule to post.

I didn't realise that many have written about cannibalism too until I went through others' stories ðŸ˜…",t3_9xnyci
