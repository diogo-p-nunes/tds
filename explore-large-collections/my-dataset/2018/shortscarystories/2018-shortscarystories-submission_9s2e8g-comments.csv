e8ly3go,t3_9s2e8g,"Is there a reason for the hostilities towards people with red watches? Is the protagonist/antagonist a cartoon bull?

And I'd also like to ask what the title means. ",t3_9s2e8g
e8lslub,t3_9s2e8g,Well written.  But what does the title mean?,t3_9s2e8g
e8lt6xs,t3_9s2e8g,"This is really good, and I'm curious about the title. I tried to google it and didn't get anywhere. Could you explain it? ",t3_9s2e8g
e8mij21,t3_9s2e8g,Wow,t3_9s2e8g
e8u21i9,t1_e8ly3go,I *think* the narrator killed his brother and Rebecca having the same watch triggered him to kill her as well.,t3_9s2e8g

e8lxxvb,t1_e8lt6xs,I think itâ€™s an anagram . Trying to figure it out.,t3_9s2e8g
e8u8xnw,t1_e8u21i9,"I mean, that much is obvious, but I want to know why. ",t3_9s2e8g
e8m06sr,t1_e8lxxvb,"I thought of that, also. The only thing I could come up with was 'Camero,' which would make sense if the red object was a car. Other than that, there's something called 'OMERACT,' but it's related to rheumatology. ",t3_9s2e8g
e8v200o,t1_e8u8xnw,Why do psychotic do any of the things they do?,t3_9s2e8g
e8m18dm,t1_e8m06sr,Yeah I got nothing now.,t3_9s2e8g
e8m18ts,t1_e8m06sr,Yeah I got nothing now.,t3_9s2e8g
e8m5zbt,t1_e8m06sr,Is it meant to be amorce?,t3_9s2e8g
e8va1gy,t1_e8v200o,"Usually for a variety of reasons, like any other person.",t3_9s2e8g
