eahsgjm,t3_a0gtsh,"... seems like she didnt care much about the ""fresh bodies"" inlcuding her supposed ""boyfriend"" Mark. Seems like just another day at work for her.",t3_a0gtsh
eai9z96,t3_a0gtsh,"Nice story, but the ending was partially clear from the get-go once they mentioned fresh bodies coming in. I suggest working in building up to the climax and revealing even the smallest of details only when necessary, since I think that the reveal of the narrator being dead would work well with the added twist of Andrew's conspiracy if nobody saw it coming, leading to a complete 180 in terms of the situation. Good job though. ",t3_a0gtsh

eaiejhc,t3_a0gtsh,"CORRECTIONS:

* line 2 : ""new research suggests""
* line 3: ""especially since fresh bodies have just come in""
* line 5: ""people usually experience those (‚Ä¶) right after the heart stops beating""
* line 12: ""Sarah slams her equipment (‚Ä¶) I have to clean my boyfriend's body""
* line 15: ""he was on his way to pick you up earlier tonight, right?"" 
* line 18: ""according to your theory, these bodies can still hear what the living say around them? (‚Ä¶) you're joking around too much, this is serious.""
* line 20: ""let me speak to him in private (‚Ä¶) Sarah let out another disgusted groan (‚Ä¶) ""I guess messing with your car was successful. told ya I'd win. Sarah's mine now. Bye""

some of these are just suggestions for a change of wording to help the story flow, but this was a great story and your English is not even that bad. This was such a cool idea, good job! hope the corrections help :)",t3_a0gtsh
eaiiqc8,t3_a0gtsh,"So the research could not only predict when a person dies, but also allow the dead listening to people talk before eventually slipping away? 
From this story, the prediction part is irrelevant right? Or am I missing something?",t3_a0gtsh

ebz0pbc,t3_a0gtsh,"Nice! I like this. I recently read an article suggesting brain activity immediately after death. On the fence as to whether this is a good thing, or not. My husband died of a heart attack last year. I spent a good 10-15 minutes performing CPR while we waited for the ambulance to arrive. After which the EMTs worked on him in an attempt to get his heart going. Surely there are many cases in which the dead person is locked in their body and experiencing horrific things, if the study is correct. That is sad. 

It also makes me wonder. People talk about how so-and-so died ""peacefully"". Well, ok, so they died in their sleep. Do they continue dreaming, for a time, or do they become aware of their plight until their brain activity ends?",t3_a0gtsh

eahus1h,t1_eahm1yq,The story is good - can you make Sarah a bit more emotional or trying to hold back tears or looking pale? Since her boyfriend was lying dead in front of her. ,t3_a0gtsh
eahr07d,t1_eahm1yq,"""especially since we have fresh bodies just came in,""

Should be ""had fresh bodies just come in"" or ""have fresh bodies that just came in""

Otherwise, I don't see any glaring flaws, good story",t3_a0gtsh
eaim1b3,t1_eahm1yq,"It is easier if I bold or strikethrough to show what I think you should edit:

""I know I shouldn't bring up morbid subjects here,"" I heard Andrew ~~talk~~ say from behind the counter, ""but new research suggest**s** that we actually know when we're dead.""

Sarah sighed. ""Yeah, and I agree that we should**n't** ~~stop~~ talk~~ing~~ about that, especially since we have fresh bodies **that** just came in, including Mark. You know how I loved Mark.‚Äù

Andrew laughed. ""But this is interesting. You know what makes it more interesting? People usually experience~~s~~ those out-of-body phenomenon while in this state, right after the heart stop**s** beating, when we pronounce the patient dead.""

Sarah was listening uninterestedly while cleaning the bodies. ""Those were the experiences the patients tell, when the doctor**s** successfully 'restart' the**ir** heart**s**, either via CPR, defibs, or other methods,"" Andrew continue**d**~~s~~. ""I don't know, maybe they experienced some kind of hallucinations or something as their consciousness slip**ped** away, little by little. Is this ~~the~~ proof that there's no afterlife?""

My mind almost couldn't comprehend any ~~single~~ **of the** words Andrew uttered, as I felt so sleepy.

Sarah slam**med** her equipment down ~~to~~ **on** the table. ""Can~~‚Äôt~~ you make my job any harder? I have to clean my boyfriend**'s** body by myself here, and you‚Äôre not being helpful! Ugh the life of med students!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, alright, calm down. ~~Sheez~~**Sheesh**.‚Äù Andrew raised his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thinking this might take your mind off ~~from~~ him, since it happened so fast. That multiple car accident, so horrible. Thankfully you weren‚Äôt in that car. He was on the way to pick you up earlier ~~this night~~ **tonight**, no?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright! Alright then, I‚Äôll entertain your thought if that ~~can~~ **will** make you stop bothering me!‚Äù Sarah shouted impatiently. Her voice was trembling. ‚ÄúBy your theory, ~~so~~ these bodies **can** still ~~can~~ hear what the living say~~s~~ around them? So, do you want to say something to Mark before I prep the body? He wasn't just my boyfriend~~. H~~**,h**e was your friend too~~,~~ you know. Just pay him some respect. You ~~were~~ **are** joking too much ~~in~~ **about** a very inappropriate situation.""

""Oh of course, let me ~~said to~~ tell him in private, man to man,"" Andrew **said,** giggl**ing**~~ed~~ at his own joke, ~~by~~ after which I could hear~~d~~ Sarah let out another disgust**ed** groan. ~~And as~~ I **could** barely ~~felt~~ **feel** his warm breath on my cold, stiff neck~~,~~ **as** ~~I  heard him~~ he whisper**ed**~~ing to~~ in my ear, ""I guess hacking your car ~~is~~ was a success. Told ya ~~I'll~~ I'd win. I'm stealing Sarah. Bye.""

I know it might look like a lot of edits, but they are all minor issues, mostly with preserving past and present tenses. I tried to preserve sentence structure and intent. I did not do this to make you feel bad, but to possibly help you learn. English is very tricky with its nuances of grammar. Your vocabulary and sentence structure are impressive. I have seen college students in America write far worse. And your story has a very nice premise and overall layout too.",t3_a0gtsh
eahrxd3,t1_eahm1yq,"You did a great job, bravo : ) There's a Tales from the Crypt episode with a similar premise you might like: Abra Cadaver (s03e04)",t3_a0gtsh
eahplkf,t1_eahm1yq,"Oh no, that‚Äôs very good! Enjoyed it. ",t3_a0gtsh
eahteub,t1_eahm1yq,I wasn‚Äôt looking for any but I didn‚Äôt even notice any mistakes now. I‚Äôve seen worse.,t3_a0gtsh
eai6esh,t1_eahsgjm,Yeah I realized that. I‚Äôm too focused with Andrew. I have improved parts of the story. I hope this can fix it.,t3_a0gtsh
eailv09,t1_eai9z96,"For me, the narrator was obviously one of the bodies at the very moment where he says he just feels sleepy. A bit on the nose, hmm? ",t3_a0gtsh
eak4yzs,t1_eai9z96,"Yeah, I'm at dilemma between concealing the crucial detail, and still keeping the narrator as part of the story. I'll try to do better next time! Thanks!",t3_a0gtsh
eak52ci,t1_eahzcyv,Will you shit your pants even more if I told you that this was based on real-life research? üòÇ [https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/die-you-know-youre-dead-11368627](https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/die-you-know-youre-dead-11368627),t3_a0gtsh

eak562d,t1_eaiejhc,Thank you for the suggestion! Your punchline suggestion was indeed very smooth to read! I was struggling with selecting better words for it. I'm using it. Thanks for the feedback too!,t3_a0gtsh
eak5btg,t1_eaiiqc8,"The research was now separating between what the medic says that a person is ""officially"" dead (which is the heart stops beating), and what is actually experienced by the now dead person. When the heart stops beating, this only means that the brain doesn't have enough impulse anymore to send to the heart to keep the heart beating. But this doesn't mean that the brain stops working completely. The part where our consciousness is probably can still work hours after we're officially declared dead, just that in a very very limited capacity. Probably enough to let us understand that ""oh crap, I'm actually dead.""

eak5f9a,t1_eak43je,"That is a very much better word for it. I'm an IT person, so I understand more of IT world's jargon than other fields lol. I'm eventually settled with ""messing"" from other user's suggestion, but thanks for suggesting! :)",t3_a0gtsh
ec5niix,t1_ebz0pbc,"Oh I'm really sorry to hear that about your husband. I think the consciousness part of the brain enters a trance-like state when the person is declared dead. Well, they basically slip into a state of unconsciousness alright. But we know that sometimes people in sleeping state can sometimes pick up whether if somebody say anything around them, right? So for the declared dead person, their unconscious brain may pick up some stimulus from their senses, but they may already lack of processing power to analyse what those stimulus mean. But, yeah, I think for a simple realisation of ""Yea, I'm finally die. There's no turning back. This is it."" at brief moments after the person is declared dead, it's still possible. Especially if the person has already prepared for the impending slow death, e.g. incurable disease.",t3_a0gtsh

eahyhpb,t1_eahr07d,Right! Fantastic story. If OP hadn't mentioned it I certainly wouldn't have known English wasn't his first language.,t3_a0gtsh
eak4wdc,t1_eaim1b3,"Oh wow, this is really awesome! Thanks for putting the effort to put strikethrough / bold formatting there to indicate before & after. Yeah, the ""s"" and tenses really threw me off when writing stories, because the story is usually told using past tense, and I have the tendency to use the present tense. I do learn a lot about how daily sentences supposed to be structured from your fix. I guess my native language still have a big role when I form sentences in English. I hope one day I can overcome it. I have incorporated your fix. This is very very helpful. Thanks!!!",t3_a0gtsh

eai68tn,t1_eahteub,"Thanks! Some people say the way I write English stories seems a little bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù for them, so I tried to practice here while ‚Äúcopying‚Äù writing technique from other great writers here. I hope I can overcome that someday. Thank you.",t3_a0gtsh
eak5e4w,t1_eai6esh,"No worries, still great work. Tho if i could suggest something else... maybe it'd be more ironic if the andrew said the theory was from mark. And that mark was sentimental about that theory. Idk.",t3_a0gtsh
