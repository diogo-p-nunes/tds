eamenor,t3_a0yq0s,"This is *Short* Scary Stories for a reason, so there are a lot of details missing that probably shouldn't be?   


I'm assuming that each of the orbs are ten years that were taken away from the woman who was shooting at Chris and Mike, but how would an infant-turned-adult know how to use a gun? Why would she ask for her child back, instead of her child**hood**? (Unless one of the missing details is that she didn't have a good education, on account of the fact that she's a baby?)  


Also, if forty years were stolen from the woman, then why? It seems that they only needed to take five from her?   


I'm probably off base here, but that's the flaw in lack of details. I don't know where this was supposed to go.   


Sometimes, lack of details can be a wonderful thing. I've read stories twice because the second time through, I know something that I didn't learn until the end of the first read-through. The context of the story was changed with a seemingly minor detail. Unfortunately, this is not one of those occasions.   


OP, I love the detail that you did put into this. I just wish there was more. ",t3_a0yq0s

eamo9wi,t1_eamenor,"I don’t know if there have been changes to the story, because I do see the details you claim are lacking. The mother (so not the child) is the one with the gun, with makes sense because what 1 month year old would be left completely alone? She is also asking for her baby daughter back, (not her child as you say), so to me it was pretty clear that not her years were taken.

Also, to me it’s pretty clear that Chris needed 5 years, but since Mike is paying him, he probably trades in this sort of stuff. If Chris wants it, more people will probably buy it right?

I think there is just enough detail to create a world and there is also enough mystery to leave some to our imagination!",t3_a0yq0s
eamo6st,t1_eamenor,"She's the mother of the girl they took the life from. It says it in the story. The daughter wouldn't have to know how to use a gun. I also don't think it's that they only NEEDED 5 years, Mike probably got greedy and is going to sell them, or keep them so that he won't need to age later. I don't think there are details missing, I think that letting us fill in certain blanks makes it creepier. We don't know what Mike wanted those extra 35 years for, and the possibilities make it scary.",t3_a0yq0s
eamejnz,t1_eam0d4j,"In this universe you can manipulate the age of other people by making them older or younger. The green orbs are the device used to transfer years between people, it seems. 

Chris needed 5 years to give to his sister, making her younger, so she could qualify for a treatment for her cancer. He and Mike robbed the woman’s baby of 4 decades of her life. The part of the story we read is them running away. ",t3_a0yq0s

The emphasis ('now' in bold) is mine, but that's what confused me, more than anything else.

This is why I think that the baby became an adult. ",t3_a0yq0s

ean7e2o,t1_eamqxe8,"But wouldn’t it make sense for the baby to now be in her forty since they “took” 40 years? The age of the mother is never specified, there isn’t really a reason to think this part is about the person following them.",t3_a0yq0s
eanoxpo,t1_eamqtrm,"I guess I can see the confusion, but the woman chasing them says to ""give me back my baby"" multiple times. It's clear she's the mother. Maybe those lines could've been phrased better, but it's still clear what's going on.",t3_a0yq0s
