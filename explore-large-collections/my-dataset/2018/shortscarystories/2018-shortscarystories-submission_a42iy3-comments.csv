ebazfvt,t3_a42iy3,Thanks in advance for reading. I know its not a super original idea but it is mostly true. Instead of becoming a void there was a videogamey thing that said player 2 joined and a fast thing came and punched me so hard i died but since it was a dream death i respawned and everything got brighter. The fast thing kept hitting me and adding vision until i woke up but thats really anticlimactic and dumb so i changed it abit. ,t3_a42iy3
