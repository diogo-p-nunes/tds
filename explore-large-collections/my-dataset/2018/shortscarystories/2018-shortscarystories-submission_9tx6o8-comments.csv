e9j5t99,t3_9tx6o8,"This was so very sad to me. My Father passed away abruptly about 3 and half years ago and ever since that has happened, I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of losing my Mom who also happens to be my best friend in the world. For clarification, my Father didn‚Äôt live with us. He and my Mom separated long ago, I was about 2 or so when they did. I‚Äôm now 31. 

After he passed away and me having to control what happened to him when he was initially in the hospital as I‚Äôm the eldest, I felt it was necessary for me to speak to my Mom about how it is she wished to be taken care of once she‚Äôs gone. It may seem selfish, but I told her straightforward that I really, really want her to be cremated because that way, I can have part of her with me should I leave the area we live in now. I‚Äôd hate to move away far enough that visiting her and tidying up her gravesite becomes a nonexistent affair. 

Reading this just made me think of that. It‚Äôs sad and yet it‚Äôs going to happen to all of us, whether we‚Äôre buried or cremated. Over time we‚Äôll be left in the ground and left on shelves or mantles or a loved ones jewelry. 

This was really nice OP. I don‚Äôt want you to think that I don‚Äôt like the story, I did. It‚Äôs just sad that there‚Äôs truth in this. ",t3_9tx6o8

e93ekv4,t1_e938rm5,Yeah just because the last line ends abruptly so I interpreted it as him spending too long in the grave to the point that he forgets his name. Although that might seem a bit off since he remembered his dog‚Äôs name. Nevertheless I really like the story!,t3_9tx6o8

So, was this person really communicating with someone but unable to tell the name? Or was someone walking through a cemetery imagining it? Don't know! Up to you. ",t3_9tx6o8
