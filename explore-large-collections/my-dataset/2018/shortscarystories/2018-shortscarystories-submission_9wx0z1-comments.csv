e9nxk3a,t3_9wx0z1,"So I don't dream that much anymore but when I do they're always nightmares. This was one from two nights ago.  They used to be more extravagant, like walking in on the climax of an intense adventure thriller, but now theyre just getting shorter, and darker.   A few weeks ago my wife woke me up from a nightmare saying that I was screaming ""who are you?"" out loud in my sleep and scared the crap out of her. A few months ago I had a dream with no visuals, just a dog wimpering.  We don't have a dog. I actually got up to check the house and the garage because I thought it was real. I fell back asleep and heard it again, 3 more times that night.

I've never had a dream with a flashback before and I've never had one where I was the bad person. I didn't like it. So, I've decided to start writing them down and I'll post them here as they happen.",t3_9wx0z1
