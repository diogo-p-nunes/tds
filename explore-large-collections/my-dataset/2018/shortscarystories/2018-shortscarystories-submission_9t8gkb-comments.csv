e8usiqd,t3_9t8gkb,"All I could think about while reading the story was [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR46befSSi8) from the Men in Black II movie and I'm sorry, but I just couldn't take it seriously.",t3_9t8gkb
e8vgqno,t3_9t8gkb,Nicely done.  I always enjoy urban horror stories. They're a nice change of pace from the usual rural settings. ,t3_9t8gkb
e8ulaml,t1_e8ul0yj,I wouldn't if they were underground where I live. ðŸ˜°,t3_9t8gkb
e8usw4t,t1_e8usiqd,Haha that was the inspiration for sure! I always kept it in mind but thought how terrifying it would actually be to live in a city with a monster that eats trains every now and then. ,t3_9t8gkb
e8xo8un,t1_e8vgqno,Thanks! Never noticed that a disproportionate amount of horror stories have rural settings until you mentioned it. ,t3_9t8gkb
e8v46xv,t1_e8usw4t,"I thought of that scene as well but I really enjoyed this. I was envisioning a ""near-future beginnings of a cyberpunk city,"" but with monsters instead of straight sci-fi.",t3_9t8gkb
