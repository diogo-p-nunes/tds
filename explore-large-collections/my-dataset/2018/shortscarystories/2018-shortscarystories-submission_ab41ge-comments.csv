ecy60zi,t3_ab41ge,"In the beginning I definitely something bad was going to come from the end of the aliens, but I'm pleased that it ended with them leaving and being more terrified of us/something we've encountered daily, monthly, yearly, etc. It definitely left me with questions of what could happen next, and I will always admire a story that can do that.",t3_ab41ge

egib8gs,t3_ab41ge,"I like the ""aliens are terrified by normal human stuff"" stories. Nightmares work especially well, because really bad night terrors can actually cause mental and physical illness, even deaths via heart attack. I have a repeating nightmare that I've had since I've been 10 about my grandfather dying. It was the worst thing I could ever imagine, always. I ended up with so many anxiety problems and depression by age 18...and then he passed away for real. I was depressed and suicidal for years before getting help. The constant nightmares didn't help. DON'T help. I still have those nightmares about him dying. I always wake up thinking ""oh, God, it was just a nightmare, everything's oka-oh...he really is gone..."" and then just fall asleep and usually have a stupid dream about dragons or Spongebob or something after that.

I can see how someone who has never experienced nightmares would be terrified that people could deal with those without going insane. ",t3_ab41ge

eiglfbf,t1_edhretm,Basically the aliens retreat once they find out we experience nightmares. They warn us to leave the planet and stay away from sleep. It's basically supposed to mean that nightmares are bad and there is something in/on our planet and we need to evacuate.,t3_ab41ge

ecy5xl6,t1_ecxxmgi,"Pfft. Our brains likely work so much differently compared to whatever version of 'brains' their biology has, perhaps for them nightmares aren't normal and when they started, it was some sort of telegraphing before a horrific, eldritch abomination or something attacked them, and were just too terrified to consider it anything but that.

Right, there’s no inconsistency. Either the aliens visiting made the nightmares an actual threat or theyre just chumps. I also really love how you said “theres tons of different explanations that round out the story” and gave none at all, jackass.",t3_ab41ge

eesv97u,t1_eesrkew,"> What if there's an ancient being feeding off our dreams and draining our lifetime? What if nightmares are the lives of other versions of us and earth is some sort of portal to them? What if our earth is actually God and he's making us have nightmares. Maybe we have to stay awake to actually leave earth because otherwise it will somehow keep us in place.

Hey, buddy, the point of giving examples is it's meant to bolster your argument, not make it worse.

The criteria it has to fit is

>1.humans have experienced it for years

>2.it hasn't been a problem to us and we've been able to deal with it easily for all of our existence

>3.The aliens warn us to not sleep

>4.This shocks our prior understanding from prior to the aliens visiting, meaning, logically, that

>a. We're fine to do what we've always done as long we've been comfortable living as we normally have. (i.e. the aliens are wrong)

>b. the aliens visiting caused it to become bad suddenly, meaning **now** sleeping is a problem (which is bad writing)

So, here, let's break down why your examples fit into the two things I mentioned.

>What if there's an ancient being feeding off our dreams and draining our lifetime?

So it's the same thing we've experienced since humanity first existed and there's no need to suddenly stop sleeping. scenario a

>What if nightmares are the lives of other versions of us and earth is some sort of portal to them?

So it's the same thing we've experienced since humanity first existed and there's no need to suddenly stop sleeping. scenario a

>What if our earth is actually God and he's making us have nightmares.

So it's the same thing we've experienced since humanity first existed and there's no need to suddenly stop sleeping. scenario a

>Maybe we have to stay awake to actually leave earth because otherwise it will somehow keep us in place.

THIS ONE IS INTERESTING because you gave literally the worst example possible. So we've been sleeping for millennia. Sleeping makes us stay in place. So we should not sleep to get off, right? Well great, that's a great explanation, except that **we've been sleeping for a millennia already, so we're already stuck in place and it doesn't matter**. scenario a.

>But what if the aliens know that the nightmares are a sign of an apocalyptic event? If they've already mastered interstellar travel they will obviously be more advanced and probably a lot older than humanity.

so we can see the future and it's not good to be able to see the future *suddenly* even thought we've been seeing the future for millenia. scenario b",t3_ab41ge

eewcp5l,t1_eewcn7k,"Ohhh, so scenario b then? Right? The aliens that visited caused it And every example you gave didnt reflect that, right?

The whole reason you give examples is to bolster your argument, you know that, right?",t3_ab41ge
