eca5smj,t1_eca5ep3,"Sure, which part?",t3_a8ef1w
ecc41dr,t1_ecc24x7,"I personally like reading scary stories that leave most of the detail up to the reader's imagination. Use plain language, with minimal description. Stories are more scary when the reader creates the scene themselves instead of relying on over saturated descriptions from the story.  ",t3_a8ef1w

eca6e22,t1_eca5vvu,"Well in the woods she was startled out of her contemplation by a creep, when she spotted him behind her he hid, so she ran back to her home, went to sleep and woke up abruptly during the night, and she noticed one of the flowers of the tree in the forest was on the floor, next to her bed; since she didnt put it here herself, she was petrified and feared the worst, fainted and while fainting, saw that creep hiding behind her curtains",t3_a8ef1w
