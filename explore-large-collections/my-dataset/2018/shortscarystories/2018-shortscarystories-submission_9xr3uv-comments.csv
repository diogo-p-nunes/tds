They think we're giving them a great life depending on us with us, a roof over their heads and affection but never knowing there's a whole world out there and they're just trapped in our homes never allowed to leave.

Then sometimes one of my cats manages to slip outside, gets caught in the rain or another cat or dog tries to attack them and they start getting hungry but are too lazy to hunt and end up coming right back to my door yowling and begging to be left back in and won't leave my side for a day or two.",t3_9xr3uv
