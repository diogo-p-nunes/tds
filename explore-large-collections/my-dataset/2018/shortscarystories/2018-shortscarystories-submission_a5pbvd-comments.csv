ebodtj1,t3_a5pbvd,It’s refreshing to see more realistic horror emerging lately. It’s both sad and creepy because we can take a good guess as to what happened next. Great job!,t3_a5pbvd
ebsq6gc,t3_a5pbvd,"I really like this type of genre and your story. My only critique is that when reading it I thought she/he probably wouldn't say ""metallic"".",t3_a5pbvd
ebpbotl,t3_a5pbvd,"That’s so sad. The fact that are people that neglect there kids in similar ways is awful.

Great story ",t3_a5pbvd
ebqo0hh,t1_ebodtj1,Thank you! I usually like to make realistic stories because I think it is a bit more frightening that the incident could happen in real life.,t3_a5pbvd
ebv15jf,t1_ebsq6gc,"Oh got it, I will rephrase that. Thank you!",t3_a5pbvd
ebqo2mp,t1_ebpbotl,"Thank you! Neglect really is bad, the child in the story wasn’t aware of it either. :(",t3_a5pbvd
