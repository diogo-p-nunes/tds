e8wgk04,t1_e8w8bfz,Unfortunate that people copy others stories out here :(,t3_9tffdy

e8w98oq,t1_e8vwzns,"Bruh donâ€™t gotta be rude about it, your first comment was enough no need to make them feel as though they didnâ€™t put effort in. Weâ€™re writers not editors ðŸ¤—",t3_9tffdy
e8wk9ry,t1_e8winz3,"2 accs, can send proof that that's me.",t3_9tffdy
e8w969a,t1_e8vx1u3,"Dude trust me as a writer I miss things like this all the time!! When you get into the editing thick of things itâ€™s hard to catch every comma, quotation mark or double words. I didnâ€™t notice because I was involved your story and not in degrading you work! I liked this sad but well written and gave a different perspective for suicide which can be analyzed in a couple different ways so nice!! ",t3_9tffdy
