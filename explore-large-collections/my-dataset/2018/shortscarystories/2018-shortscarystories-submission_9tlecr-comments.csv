e8ygb9g,t3_9tlecr,"Turn around dad? Fuck nah bitch, I'm bouta Hulk the fuck up and punt yo ass out the window. I ain't a dumbass horror protagonist. Expect your knife through your own eye, I ain't stupid. ",t3_9tlecr
e8x8ks1,t3_9tlecr,brilliant ,t3_9tlecr
e8xajn6,t3_9tlecr,This is so creative and so good.,t3_9tlecr
e8xn52s,t3_9tlecr,"This is really great and original. Just a personal suggestion, for me it would've worked better without the first search about mom and dad waking up. Without that I think it would be more of a plot twist that at the very end you realize she's gonna kill her dad.",t3_9tlecr
e8xfrix,t3_9tlecr,Damn this is good,t3_9tlecr
e8xciyx,t3_9tlecr,I thought this was an actual screenshot posted by a parent and i chuckled my way through it like an idiot. Well done op. ,t3_9tlecr
e8xi78y,t3_9tlecr,Very original. Love it!,t3_9tlecr
e8xn7ya,t3_9tlecr,Interesting new concept for storytelling. Well done. ,t3_9tlecr
e93b8h4,t3_9tlecr,Lmao this girl really looked at a magic site to hide a body,t3_9tlecr
e8xcasz,t3_9tlecr,"I understand the concept, except the last part where she searches 'turn around dad', what does that mean?

And excellent concept. üñí",t3_9tlecr
e8xm3mm,t3_9tlecr,Really creative way to tell a story I love it! ,t3_9tlecr
e8ya46h,t3_9tlecr,"Don't turn around, she knows where to stab you in the face, but she never researched how to attack from behind.",t3_9tlecr
e8xoshe,t3_9tlecr,bravo üíê,t3_9tlecr
e8xatem,t3_9tlecr,üëçüëçI love it,t3_9tlecr
e8xig5p,t3_9tlecr,"That's not search history. If anything, it's browser history. You'll be fine!",t3_9tlecr
e8xtvi0,t3_9tlecr,Original and well thought out. Nice to see fresh content here. Great not-a-twist as well.,t3_9tlecr
e8xz1ar,t3_9tlecr,I wish we had more creativity like this on this sub ,t3_9tlecr
e8xzmsn,t3_9tlecr,Anyone tried googling all the entries?,t3_9tlecr
e90smfp,t3_9tlecr,"Me, half way through the story: Oh ok, daughter wants to kill parents. Cool.

Me, at the end: HOLY MOTHER OF ALL SHITS, SHE'S BEHIND ME!!!!!!!!! D:

That ending was so creatively done, fucking love it.",t3_9tlecr
e95eyn7,t3_9tlecr,Really loved this one. Was not expecting those last three searches. ,t3_9tlecr
e8xyg5q,t3_9tlecr,omg that ending i love this ,t3_9tlecr
e8yjmds,t3_9tlecr,"Damn, that really got me. *Very* cool format. ",t3_9tlecr

e95i41o,t3_9tlecr,Good job. Really good job. Quite a long time since I was genuinely shocked by something on this sub,t3_9tlecr
e97ttzc,t3_9tlecr,Really good. :D,t3_9tlecr
e99o28n,t3_9tlecr,It‚Äôs phenomenal that you wrote such a chilling story with no actual narrative and in such a unique way. This is my new favorite scary story. ,t3_9tlecr
e9af1z8,t3_9tlecr,Can't believe this story slipped past me. Well done.,t3_9tlecr
eah69nx,t3_9tlecr,This made me stomach drop! Awesome and creative,t3_9tlecr
edfi7ia,t3_9tlecr,Holy fucking shit this gave me goosebumps,t3_9tlecr
efq2izt,t3_9tlecr,12:05 PM: How to put your daughter up for adoption.,t3_9tlecr
e8yuux3,t3_9tlecr,"Wait a minute... The title is ""**My Daughter's** Search History""  ...poor girl couldn't pull it off D:",t3_9tlecr
e8y38yx,t3_9tlecr,"Good story. But that is some serious bad planning, googling everything along the way",t3_9tlecr
e8yk1st,t3_9tlecr,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

eaw9ffg,t3_9tlecr,Everyone was saying the ‚Äòturn around dad‚Äô was a message prompt for her dad to turn around but my first thought was that the murder was successful but the dad was somehow still moving,t3_9tlecr
ebzdhig,t3_9tlecr,I saw it coming but three times in a row threw me off,t3_9tlecr
e8ycg4t,t3_9tlecr,I lol'd more on every entry ,t3_9tlecr
e8yhrh1,t1_e8xmajv,Street smarts! ,t3_9tlecr
e8yxb8n,t1_e8xmajv,"I usually don't comment here, but it's worth stressing that incognito mode **doesn't help** against a dedicated attacker. If the attacker controls the network (like government, or your parent owning home network) you're only safe with a VPN and/or TOR. If the attacker controls your machine, you're **not** safe (think: spyware, ""parential control"" etc).

OFC Incognito Mode is good enough to stop most parents. I decided to comment, because it may actually save somebody from NSA or shit.",t3_9tlecr
e8yijmk,t1_e8ygb9g,"But I can see the dad instinctively turn around to check behind him, a reflex. Because you wouldn't figure out the time scale so quick, you'd hope you were quicker. And the bewilderment, and puzzlement he must have been feeling may affect  his cognition.
But maybe, if he had quick reflexes, he'd just duck and turn, knocking the kids legs so he falls over. I had time to analyse it though, Dad only had milliseconds. Potentially. The end. ",t3_9tlecr
e8yk0sd,t1_e8xn52s,I think op trying to say that children may make terrible decisions just to solve tiny problems,t3_9tlecr
e8ym75d,t1_e8xn52s,"my main problem with this is, even without that first mom and dad question, you still know she‚Äôs planning a murder. not that there is anything wrong with this approach, just i was expecting OP to frame it as she‚Äôs doing a school project that  focuses on crimes and homicides. it‚Äôs still to some level disturbing but that way the twist pays off better",t3_9tlecr
e9gxueb,t1_e93b8h4,"Ikr, it made the story more realistic and relatable.",t3_9tlecr
e8xd9sj,t1_e8xcasz,"she knows her dad is going to look through her computer, and as established, she plans on stabbing him through the eye. She's behind him, so she needs him to Turn around dad",t3_9tlecr
e8xiozd,t1_e8xcasz,"My understanding is that the child is planning to murder their dad, who is looking through their internet history. The last bit implies the child is right behind him and wants him to turn around so they can stab him in the eye.  ",t3_9tlecr
e8yx6vy,t1_e8xm3mm,Hey! You stole my comment!,t3_9tlecr
e8y7pd5,t1_e8xzmsn,"Yes, & now I hear police sirens in the distance. Probably unrelated, though they seem to be getting closer. ",t3_9tlecr
e8yiwy8,t1_e8yhrh1,Incognito mode really throws parents off their rhythm!,t3_9tlecr
e8zruxk,t1_e8ym75d,For a bit I thought it was going to be a suicide query. Then murder became apparent.,t3_9tlecr
e9hg16w,t1_e9gxueb,Not really,t3_9tlecr
e8y0yqf,t1_e8xd9sj,Call me dad more bb üò´üí¶üí¶üò©üòù,t3_9tlecr
e8y2eyj,t1_e8xd9sj,"Even given that she's gonna wait in a position to do that for however long is necessary, that just seems like such a thoroughly poor choice that I kinda feel like I need an in character reason for it.",t3_9tlecr
