eb10jjv,t3_a2t5oy,"Story number 6 in my first month on this site. As always, let me know what you think.

&#x200B;

I'm currently on a sleeper train. i wish i could make a good story from that, but it's just boring. ",t3_a2t5oy
eb12ap0,t3_a2t5oy,This was difficult to read. Your description of the claustrophobia-inducing conditions was well done. ,t3_a2t5oy

eb25ckk,t3_a2t5oy,"This is fantastic. But I’d like to draw attention to the final line:

“It’s just me alive down here”

He spared the others from lifelong suffering. As a result of his “treason”, he doesn’t even have the comfort of knowing that there are thousands of others undergoing the exact same torment. 

Even for solitary confinement, he is truly, inhumanly alone. ",t3_a2t5oy
eb103yf,t3_a2t5oy,nice twist at the end there,t3_a2t5oy
eb13mp4,t3_a2t5oy,It’s beyond terrifying to think of being alone with your thoughts forever. ,t3_a2t5oy
eb1ap1c,t3_a2t5oy,Awesome story. I like the context of a dystopian future with a dictatorship regime. The build up of this one person being cruel and evil by condemning people to torture. Then the the turn with him being put to the same sentence for murder. My first thoughts were that he killed one person as they came and that the story will progress to say how bad he felt and that the person he killed should be the first to have a merciful death. I was pleasantly surprised and glad that I was wrong. ,t3_a2t5oy

eb1yzcu,t3_a2t5oy,"Oh my goodness, i LOVE how many times our idea of the narrator is refocused in such a short time as we get more bits of info! Complicit to oppression for a paycheck; driven to madness and murder; a victim pitifully punished in a hellish way that surely even a serial killer hasn't earned -- and then, the final tragic and heroic twist, of finding out what exactly they did.....and even at the end, their tormented thoughts of regret give us some more to ponder about how to look at the story.",t3_a2t5oy

I think realistically being in that state would still cause death eventually (bedsores would turn into rotten flesh relatively quickly, and other factors would have impact as well), definitely less than 80 years. Or at least I tell that to myself for the comfort ",t3_a2t5oy

I love the concept of futuristic horror stories, especially when they're as well written as this one was and they actually appear plausible. I loved reading this as much as I hated reading it. Not because there's anything wrong with the story in an analytical sense, because that was wonderfully done, but because this is something that I feel like I've had nightmares about or maybe have seen in a movie somehow. It's truly terrifying to me. Like someone else commented, I love how our opinion changes on the narrator. I wonder how many people would actually risk it for the punishment, knowing how torturous it may be. Again, amazing concept, OP. I wish I could read it in an expanded format, maybe like a short novel. I appreciate the amount of emotion you could pull from me in such a short amount of time, nevertheless.",t3_a2t5oy

eb11qrx,t1_eb10jjv,"I really like this story and its twist! From villain to hero to victim.

I would personally add some tiny details. Those feeding tubes would get clogged within a very short while. You'd need someone to flush them regularly... or some nanobots to keep it debris free and free of bacteria/viruses or something. Instead of feeding tubes, maybe put nutrients straight into the blood stream, minimizing waste, lowering the chance of the waste tubes blocking up. Perhaps put nanobots on the blood stream to do cell repairs and stuff. Also if health is not monitored, it's almost guaranteed that the person will die unnoticed, but that wouldn't make sense as they want them to suffer. But that would get the protagonist found out immediately. Did he fake the health readings somehow? 

Really good story, I hope to read more from you!",t3_a2t5oy

Second off, yer, I can find logical problems with the 'torture'
But
Its set vaguely in the future  
There is a line about building redundancies into the punishment. 
And not knowing how the 'condemned' are doing is crucial to the end

Maybe i could flesh things out in a longer story, but i stand by the logic of this one :) ",t3_a2t5oy
eb229hk,t1_eb11qrx,"This story is top notch and I will definitely check the author's others. I would echo the feedback given in this comment. Since it's set in the future, you can take liberties with explaining away all the potential problems that would make this torture infeasible in the present. There are probably other biological functions that need to be maintained besides digestion. Describing how the maintenance process in further detail will help the reader stay immersed in the world and not be tempted to break concentration due to inconsistencies.",t3_a2t5oy

in that room, you supposedly can hear your insides doing their work. not only the more ""common"" things such as the heart or breathing (that all of a sudden are ""loud""), but even, your stomach, and whatnot. ",t3_a2t5oy
eb2wctt,t1_eb2686p,"People go deaf all the time? Is it contagious? Just playin LOL 

It does seem like that would be a logical comparison. However, I don’t know any deaf people who weren’t borne that way. So I’d be interested to hear from people who’ve gone completely deaf, from an accident of some sort. I’d have to imagine they’re  not at least a little psychologically damaged. 

Regardless though, being deaf is not the problem here. It’s being able to hear, but nothing is making a single sound. It can be very unnerving to most people. Especially when you pair it with locking them in a room with acoustic walls like like those. It seems to trigger severe claustrophobia and panic attacks in otherwise normal healthy people.

The thing I found the most interesting about that place, is most people can’t stand to be in there for more than a few minutes. Yet a Sailor, fresh off a 9 month deployment working on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, easily broke their longest record and eventually had to be asked to come out.

ebke50c,t1_ebk7deu,"No, sorry, I see how that was confusing. What you are describing is called a PEG tube (or PEJ if it goes into the small intestine). I have had the latter, and it does need to be flushed after each bag. What I have now is a standard central line, and I receive TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through it straight into my bloodstream. Those do not need to be flushed as long as the line pressure remains constant. ",t3_a2t5oy
ebmf0m5,t1_ebke50c,"Ohhh thank you for the explanation! I can't say I've worked with the TPN, just normal drips/infusions, the set-up is probably very similar? I work in Geriatrics now, mostly at people's homes and it doesn't seem to appear. 
This is possibly a dumb question, but can this completely replace nutrition given through the gastrointestinal tract? Does this give you any bothersome side effects? Have you been taught to trouble shoot it yourself? (If I understood you correctly, you have it?)",t3_a2t5oy
ebmqs69,t1_ebmf0m5,"Yes, you can, but it’s not ideal. I have gastroparesis (partial or complete stomach paralysis), so sometimes I can process food and sometimes I can’t. PEG/J tunes were a NIGHTMARE for me (horrible side effects and I couldn’t even run more than 50-100 calories a day - defeats the whole purpose) but TPN worked. Saved my life. 

As far as side effects go - it smells nasty and gives most people weird night sweats, but the main issue is that it’s REALLY hard on your liver. Most people need transplants after 10-15 years on constant TPN. Luckily, I’m usually able to switch back and forth between oral and intravenous nutrition for long enough to reset my counter on that. Yes, I’ve been taught to manage it myself - I do all my own line care and so on. I have a nurse and a pharmacy on call, and I can always call my GI and cardiologist, but I haven’t needed to more than a couple of times - it’s surprisingly simple once you get the hang of it! ",t3_a2t5oy
ebrdsbn,t1_ebmqs69,"Thank you for your thorough explanation! What a mess you went through, with the PEG/J!  I'm glad you can sometimes switch to solids with your TPN as well. Your poor liver! ",t3_a2t5oy
