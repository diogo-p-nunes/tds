east8hv,t3_a1tdbp,"I really like this. I feel like it's probably a real-life fear for people who suffer hearing loss (speaking as someone who does not, so it might be completely off the mark). The last line seems a bit awkward but in trying to think about how I would re-write it, I'm coming up empty. ",t3_a1tdbp
easi5nf,t3_a1tdbp,"this is only the second story I have written and posted, any constructive criticism would be much appreciated :)",t3_a1tdbp
ebmbdia,t3_a1tdbp,"My husband was deaf. He was not mute. He still spoke, and screamed adorably when a moth landed on/near him (probably his one phobia?). Ahem, but that aside, this was a nice read. I was just confused on the last line. The character narrating is mute? ☺",t3_a1tdbp
ebx30aj,t3_a1tdbp,Really good - great concept and the execution was short and sweet. Upvoted,t3_a1tdbp
easxzac,t3_a1tdbp,there is a movie on Netflix with the exact same plot. I wonder? 🤔,t3_a1tdbp

eat11l5,t1_east8hv,"if you come up with any suggestions feel free to let me know! and yes I have family who suffer from hearing difficulties, kinda inspired me although I was just really bored XD",t3_a1tdbp
eau4846,t1_east8hv,"Hmm I’m deaf and it doesn’t really speak to me.  I think the fact that the deafness is more of a plot device/punch line kind of pulls me out of the story. There’s definitely something here though! It reminds me of the movie “Hush” which I loved. 

Maybe don’t include the mute part at all? Maybe instead something like “I scream but I have no idea how loud my screams are, or if anyone can hear me.”

Just my amateur two cents. ",t3_a1tdbp
eatw628,t1_east8hv,"My dad suffers from hearing loss, he's been getting progressively more deaf since he was in his 20s and now has a bone conductive hearing aid, which we all just call his ear now.

He admitted to me just a few weeks ago that he feels uneasy going out alone at night when he's not wearing his ear because he can't hear anyone or anything walking up to him.

Couple that with the fact that his partner has an abusive ex-husband who goes through periods of stalking her, and that they live out in the country with nobody else around for miles and shitty phone signal, yeah, this story gave me chills.",t3_a1tdbp
ebq5dgo,t1_ebmbdia,"Thank you! ORIGINALLY yes that was the plot twist I had in mind but I got a few suggestions that it seemed a bit too forced so I settled for the speaker just being deaf and, living a quiet life with little excitement, doesn't remember how to scream - I found the idea of her not being able to hear herself quite frightening too. Hope this clears it up :)",t3_a1tdbp
ebxewyl,t1_ebx30aj,Thank you!,t3_a1tdbp
eat0xw2,t1_easxzac,If you're referring to the movie 'Hush' I did worry that it might be brought up but this was honestly something I worked on when bored there was no intentional link.,t3_a1tdbp
ebwx3td,t1_ebwdxzw,"Hey, thanks for responding I do appreciate it. In all honesty I do think our stories are way too similar for it to be a coincidence HOWEVER I'm gonna let it slide because at the end of the day most stories on here are similar and people use other people's stories for inspiration. At the same time please keep this in mind when writing stories in the future because it is hurtful to see/think that someone else is taking credit for your story, especially since it was one of my first and I'm new to this. I put effort into this story and was proud of it so I hope you understand where I'm coming from.",t3_a1tdbp
eatcc1a,t1_eat11l5,"How about:
""...but after all this time, I've forgotten how to scream""",t3_a1tdbp
eaurd31,t1_eau4846,"thank you for the feedback! I've made an edit, let me know what you think :)",t3_a1tdbp
eav9h6l,t1_eau4846,">I open my mouth as my eyes widen in terror, but after all this time I've forgotten how to scream.

Yes! Was just about to comment about this movie",t3_a1tdbp
eatx071,t1_eatw628,"idek what to say that's horrible I'm so sorry he has the go through that, all of you. I hope he overcomes his fears and that you all stay safe. Again I'm sorry you are all going through this and I hope my story didn't offend you or make you too uncomfortable x",t3_a1tdbp
ebwxxeg,t1_ebwx3td,[deleted],t3_a1tdbp
eath788,t1_eatcc1a,hmmmm I that line does work but at the same time I feel like the fact that the speaker is mute comes as a shock (at least i hope it does) because the whole story is about her being deaf ygm?  I do appreciate the feedback though and will definitely keep it in mind :),t3_a1tdbp
eatuokf,t1_eatcc1a,I do like that a lot better. The part about being mute seems forced.,t3_a1tdbp
eaur4vw,t1_eatcc1a,"ok I'm gonna try this line because I think it fits best and I'll see if people like it, if not I'll change it back. Thank you for this suggestion!",t3_a1tdbp
eaurh7b,t1_eaurd31,Awesome! That ending is super creepy. ,t3_a1tdbp
eaui3qk,t1_eatx071,"First of all, thank you so much for your kind words.
Disability of any kind can happen to anyone though, and most people either know or know of someone suffering from hearing loss. I think its part of what makes your story so relatable, at least to me.

People tend to most enjoy the horror stories they can connect with, please don't worry about being offensive at all, I thought your story was excellent.",t3_a1tdbp
ebwyb59,t1_ebwxxeg,I thought this was sincere at first but I've just seen a comment on your recent post confirming the fact that you have been copying other people's stories too...,t3_a1tdbp
eausgav,t1_eaur4vw,You're welcome :),t3_a1tdbp
eauomrz,t1_eaui3qk,thank you bro :'),t3_a1tdbp
ebx1yci,t1_ebwyb59,[deleted],t3_a1tdbp
ebxevx2,t1_ebx1yci,"Instead of using other stories for inspiration use what's around you irl, things you see and hear, things that scare you etc. That way there's less chance it will even be close to what someone else has written about and less chance you'll be accused of copying. It makes the story more interesting too. Personally I tend to look at objects and/or people around me and just type. I type whatever comes to mind until it makes sense as a story and then edit. Yeah I'll check it out XD",t3_a1tdbp
