ea9nviv,t1_ea9niaz,"The protagonist was young when a plague swept through his land. He caught it but survived and became immune, but he was cursed with green, oozing skin. Another child died to the plague, so his village thought him a witch who had killed the child and cast him out. Now, the plague is back, and it killed the entire kingdom. However, the protagonist saw it coming and kidnapped ten children to save them; because of his immunity and isolation, they would be safe from the plague by living with him.",t3_9zhsq7
