eb1kcrh,t3_a2iy5k,I really like this a lot. I thought the reveal would just be confirming what you'd implied about the nature of the dreams. Very spooky and unsettling. I do agree with another commenter that the capitalization errors are a little distracting. what that hell is going on. Was the only one I really noticed while reading. Because it was after a quote it confused me a little. Maybe I'm just dumb lol ,t3_a2iy5k
