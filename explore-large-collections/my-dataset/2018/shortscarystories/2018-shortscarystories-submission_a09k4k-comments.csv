eahnwb5,t3_a09k4k,Wow this sub is a bit critical... i thought the story was great and super well written. I didnt predict the ending at all.,t3_a09k4k
eag48fr,t3_a09k4k,I need a little help with the ending üò¨ he'd been kidnapped? ,t3_a09k4k
eagv1wq,t3_a09k4k,Brilliantly told. Thanks for sharing. ,t3_a09k4k
eag80h9,t3_a09k4k,I predicted the ending and the story is very similar to the movie Tangled XD but your descriptions are amazing and this was a great read ,t3_a09k4k
eahx4t0,t3_a09k4k,"Good story, if you had the word space I‚Äôd like to have a fuller description of Mother - but you proved she was off kilter with her rule of ‚Äúno looking, no laughing, no leaving the house‚Äù.",t3_a09k4k
eaijjb0,t3_a09k4k,This reads like a first chapter of an interesting novel! ,t3_a09k4k
eahzdmz,t3_a09k4k,am i the only one who shit my pants reading this?,t3_a09k4k
eagvyxh,t3_a09k4k,"It was as Very predictable. You managed to build curiosity, but not the characters.

I would have enjoyed a little conflict in this piece.. The mother is painted neither white nor black.
I felt that you want the audience to empathise with the mother, but that didn't happen.

Calling them bad guys is very vague and I felt it could have gone either way (the could or actually, could not be the bad guys)

Maybe what I'm trying to say is that this story lacks conviction.
Well, that's my 2 cents.. Please feel free to throw them away if you don't agree. ",t3_a09k4k
eah4xvb,t3_a09k4k,"Stories like this have been around a while,  which makes it predictable.  However, I just can't get immuned to the horror of this situation. Not every good story needs an unexpected twist.

Good read!",t3_a09k4k
eagvlbw,t3_a09k4k,Hey there.  I‚Äôm a filmmaker and I would really love to make this into a film.  What are your thoughts on that?  Let me know.,t3_a09k4k

eag4r92,t1_eag48fr,"Yeah, sorry it wasn't clear enough!",t3_a09k4k
eagyxjb,t1_eagv1wq,Thank you!,t3_a09k4k
eaifymc,t1_eahx4t0,"Thanks a lot, yeah very valid point just didn‚Äôt want to sacrifice any more of the plot to descriptions!",t3_a09k4k
eaipg5h,t1_eaijjb0,"Thank you, that‚Äôs really nice to hear!",t3_a09k4k
eagzxbp,t1_eagvyxh,"Really grateful for your feedback. You're dead right about my intentions with the mother, if I had a little more leverage regarding word count painting her in a more positive light would be priority no.1. Regarding the bad guys, I'm not sure if I understand your comment, but surely the fact that they may or may not be bad adds to the ambiguity of the piece? 

My intentions were to use the narrative style as a medium to communicate the innocence and naivety of the boy through simple thoughts and an emphasis on sensory experience. But perhaps it wasn't executed properly. Anyway, appreciate the critique!

eagz2i9,t1_eagvlbw,"Hold up, for real?",t3_a09k4k
eahtge9,t1_eahjgdt,"You find it unrealistic that I child would recognize themselves in a photo? Children become self aware at a very young age, they would certainly see the resemblance. Visuals are everything for kids so I thought a poster would be apt? Thanks for giving your thoughts!",t3_a09k4k
eagmye5,t1_eaglftm,That's a little harsh?,t3_a09k4k
eagvvml,t1_eaglftm,"If this story took you 5 minutes to read, maybe that‚Äôs your problem. It‚Äôs like a 90 second read. ",t3_a09k4k
eagplaf,t1_eaglftm,Hey!  You‚Äôre kind of an asshole!  Just thought you should know.,t3_a09k4k
eag55on,t1_eag4r92,No I got it lol! Great story! I think the tables thing just threw me off a little. ,t3_a09k4k

eaifnxb,t1_eai6576,"I appreciate your advice and thank you for taking the time to give it. Apologies if my response seemed argumentative, just my opinion.",t3_a09k4k
eah5u2v,t1_eagqp79,"The thing is, it's not very believable. A five year old wouldn't notice a missing person sign. They probably couldn't even see it, as it would be posted at adult eye level, twice theirs. 

They wouldn't recognize their younger self. They don't have a concept of aging like that. 

A child kidnapped long enough ago to have visibly aged likely wouldn't still have missing posters up. It would be assumed the child was either dead or removed from the area. If missing posters were up, they'd be age-enhanced. ",t3_a09k4k
eahtxto,t1_eah5u2v,"Mentioned it in another reply, but most children become self-aware before the age of three, being such an inquisitive child he would take in everything- including 6 foot high posters. Honestly I feel that the recognition is plausible, and the image might also conjur up memories of a traumatic time, causing further impact.

Local missing people posters stay up for years where I‚Äôm from, especially if it was a big deal at the time. Thanks for the feedback!",t3_a09k4k
