ec53goe,t3_a7pa1i,"This story is good, but there are a couple of details that lessen my enjoyment of it. When you wrote that Scott was 'wondering' on the side of the road, you should have used wandering. (Although, given the context, he was probably doing both.)  


The second thing is the detail of someone murdering everyone in his family with a butter knife. A butcher knife would have made more sense. ",t3_a7pa1i

ec7ehkn,t3_a7pa1i,Could make a very good book. So many questions. Good job.,t3_a7pa1i

not the dog.. :(",t3_a7pa1i
ec9q3pr,t3_a7pa1i,Anyone else think TARDIS after the first paragraph?,t3_a7pa1i
ec54m8m,t3_a7pa1i,Fantastic imagery and really creepy. ,t3_a7pa1i
ec6gzsi,t1_ec53goe,"Yeah the butter knife thing took me out of the story completely. Maybe if he killed them another way beforehand.

I liked the ending though.",t3_a7pa1i
ec562j7,t1_ec53goe,I think the butter knife thing was to show how strong and savage it made him,t3_a7pa1i
ec7elen,t1_ec7ehkn,Thanks. It’s actually a concept to a much longer story. It wouldn’t let me post the whole thing here due to the 500 word limit. ,t3_a7pa1i
ec5a9n6,t1_ec562j7,"I understand that, I guess? But he would have had to saw through skin and bone for days (as the story says) and not alarm the rest of his family when they saw what he was doing to one of the members of it. There's suspension of disbelief, and then there's this. ",t3_a7pa1i
ecf4khl,t1_ec5a9n6,Maybe he tied his family up before starting to kill? ,t3_a7pa1i
