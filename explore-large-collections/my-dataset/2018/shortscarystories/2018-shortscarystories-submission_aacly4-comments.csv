ecr2xhv,t3_aacly4,Wow! Didnt get it until I read your comment and then I loved it. ,t3_aacly4

Guess my family's getting murdered while I stand at mac's place staring at the note like a dumbass.",t3_aacly4
ecthrby,t3_aacly4,"From the get-go I knew it was going to be something clever because of the formatting, but it wasn't the cliche read-the-first-word-of-each-sentence type of story. I like how you formatted it, and how well it even flows if you read it as a whole. This was really good,  OP! I'm not sure if you prefer to write this style, but if you do, *please* keep it up! It's a nice change of pace to read every now and then.",t3_aacly4
ecsx3qm,t3_aacly4,"Took me a hot minute to figure out I had to read every second line. Good job, OP! Great story !!",t3_aacly4
ecscyrq,t1_ecqtdbi,This is good! ,t3_aacly4
ecrfmo5,t1_ecr2xhv,Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_aacly4
ectp2hx,t1_ecsyw6n,"Haha, don't worry I bet it isn't that easy to figure it out at first glance.",t3_aacly4
ectousu,t1_ecthrby,"Thanks for the nice feedback! Honestly that isn't really my style because I try to vary the kind of stories here (sometimes it's a plot twist at the end, sometimes it's a dread nightmarish/gory story or something it's a story with hidden content like this.)

I find it easy enough to write like this though, if this kind of story makes more success than my others I will certainly write more things like this one!",t3_aacly4
ectozu4,t1_ecsx3qm,Thanks!,t3_aacly4
