e9hyg81,t3_9vxjbs,Great story!!! I like the way you described the people losing interest in tradition. The crackers scaring away the creature actually reminded me of the story of å¹´ which is about Chinese New year which is cool,t3_9vxjbs
e9k1u2i,t3_9vxjbs,"bahut badiya story, finally a creepy pasta related to Hinduism! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9glsod,t3_9vxjbs,"Bhai, itna bhi kya nostalgia hai?",t3_9vxjbs
eawmlse,t3_9vxjbs,"Yay! FINALLY! Itâ€™s about time someone made a little horror snippet out of Diwali. If this story was expanded, it could go a Long way (just some inspiration for /nosleep perhaps?)

Also, interestingly, the Chinese also have the same concept - the cracklings of firecrackers, the dragon dance; to keep the bad and evil at Bay. Sorry for the long comment. Loved your story and looking forward to more! 

Happy Diwali and wishing you a prosperous year ahead! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9fv5w3,t3_9vxjbs,"Hi, please let me know if it was readable. I'm a bit doubtful about how it has turned out. Thanks! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9i0qsr,t1_e9hyg81,"Thank you so much!

Can you please tell me the name of the story? I can't read the character. I would love to read about it.

Wishing you happiness and prosperity! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9k5b2a,t1_e9k1u2i,"Haha, dhanyavaad! Maybe I'll do more in the future - if I can think of stories

Wishing you a year of prosperity and happiness! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9glx8p,t1_e9glsod,"Haha, that demon is happy that people aren't bursting crackers - eco friendly rakshas hai ðŸ˜›

Mujhe to patake phode bahut saal hogaye hai

These were some of the best times in childhood

Wishing you happiness and prosperity ahead! ",t3_9vxjbs
ebd1sq8,t1_eawmlse,"Thank you so much! I'm thinking of doing one for each festival (prpvided I get a good idea)

Thank you and wishing you a prosperous year too :) ",t3_9vxjbs
e9grq9j,t1_e9fv5w3,"

So when I first read this I had no idea what Diwali was so it was a bit hard to follow. Once I actually googled it, the whole story made more sense and I thought it was actually quite good.",t3_9vxjbs
e9ipaur,t1_e9i0qsr,"Thank you!!! 

The story's called ""nian"" ",t3_9vxjbs
e9gs4gx,t1_e9grq9j,"Thank you - especially for taking the time out to look it up.

Wishing you a year full of happiness and prosperity! ",t3_9vxjbs
e9k6icr,t1_e9ipaur,"Hey, I looked it up - it's very interesting! I loved it! Thank you! 

This story is not based on a legend, just my imagination. I tried to base the demon on a mix of Alakshmi (who brings about loss) and Bali (a king in the netherworld who is allowed to come on earth and rule it for a day). So this demon isn't there in Hinduism. ",t3_9vxjbs
