e8fanp4,t3_9r4dlu,"I’m finding it pretty hard to believe that parents conscientious enough to lock up a gun would repeat the code *three times* in front of their young child. IMO, this would’ve worked much better if the father had accidentally left the safe open. ",t3_9r4dlu
e8e6qzf,t3_9r4dlu,Wow. Excellent.,t3_9r4dlu
e8ejprk,t3_9r4dlu,"This is a very real danger, and it’s why as a kid, my siblings and I were taught that guns were dangerous and we were not to touch them or we would hurt ourselves or others. No exceptions. Once we were old enough to buy a gun, we could use one.

My stepdad regularly left his pistol on the armrest of the couch by his side and he kept plenty in his room. None of us touched them because we were always told of how dangerous they were and their intended purpose. “This weapon can and will kill if you use it.” We were also taught to not try and get them in an emergency, because the attacker would take them from us and use them against us.

Being taught about this at an early age helped me and my siblings understand guns, and while we all knew how to clean them, take them apart, load them, etc., we never used them because we knew the dangers. Please, if you have guns, teach your kids that they are tools, not toys.",t3_9r4dlu

e8hkuf4,t3_9r4dlu,I thought the dad wanted the child to find the gun so he made the wife repeated the code multiple times,t3_9r4dlu
e8ehptf,t3_9r4dlu,i dont get it,t3_9r4dlu
e8fgtyi,t1_e8fanp4,"Proboubly. But people do some pretty stupid things, especially when kids are around thinking they don’t listen.

But thanks for the advice.",t3_9r4dlu
e8e6tdu,t1_e8e6qzf,Thanks,t3_9r4dlu
e8emsje,t1_e8ejprk,"I have a question, just out of curiosity, why would your step dad regularly leave them around like that? What would be the point? Was he just cleaning them or something and forgot? I don’t see the need for keeping a gun on the armrest of your couch. Seems kinda reckless.",t3_9r4dlu
e8fedhj,t1_e8ejprk,your stepdad sounds like an asshole idiot for leaving the guns around children.,t3_9r4dlu
e8f8iir,t1_e8ejprk,Thank you! Exactly! How do you mean tools? Not weapons?,t3_9r4dlu
e8f86lr,t1_e8f5t2t,Thank you so much!,t3_9r4dlu
e8hlfps,t1_e8hkuf4,No. But that would be a cool twist!,t3_9r4dlu
e8eisaw,t1_e8ehptf,"Ok basically the Mother sees a ghostly image of her little boy with a bullet hole in his chest.

Mean while the real kid is upstairs unlocking his Dad’s gun case with the code he just learned.

The Mother has no idea and at first she is relieved when the ghost disappears.

Then she hears her sun upstairs pretending he’s super man again ( Faster then a speeding bullet it’s SUPER MAN!) suddenly she realizes what’s about to happen . But she’s too late.

The little boy thought the suit turned him into super man so he shot himself thinking he’d be bullet proof.

The image the mother saw was something called a Fetch or Doppleganger. They look just like the person.

But they can also warn of death.",t3_9r4dlu
e8elqhi,t1_e8ehptf,"She had a premonition of her son being dead, before he shot himself. ",t3_9r4dlu
e8en8l4,t1_e8emsje,"It wasn’t reckless specifically because he knew no one would take it from him. It was always next to him, and he picked it up when he got up, but he was in the Marine Corps, so he felt better having his gun ready beside him at all times in case he ever needed it. Safety was on, gun wasn’t cocked, but there were of course live rounds inside.

I think it was more for him to feel safer, and I suppose in the event that some crime were to happen, someone were to break in, a mass shooting ever were to happen, or even the zombie apocalypse, it would be faster to have your method of protection right next to you at all times. Extremely unlikely, however.",t3_9r4dlu
e8fgywh,t1_e8fedhj,"In your opinion. I agree it doesn’t seem wise to me, I would never do it. But did you read his reasoning?",t3_9r4dlu
e8fj6oo,t1_e8fedhj,"What part was idiotic? Because we might try and make a run for them and take them and do something stupid? What about their presence of simply being in the room, right beside his hand, was idiotic?

Edit: or in his room for that matter? We knew not to touch them. We knew they were dangerous. Even though my brothers have ADD and one has ADHD, (who was a huge troublemaker and played plenty of pranks) none of them, nor my sisters ever tried anything with them for two reasons:

1.	We understood them. We knew they were dangerous, and we knew we would end up hurting ourselves or others if we tried to use them. More than getting in trouble, we knew they were not to be played with.
2.	They weren’t new or interesting. We weren’t curious about them because we had no reason to be. We knew how to use them, how to clean them, how to take care of them, and all the proper methods of handling them, but we never used them. We weren’t about to go in there and take a gun and screw around with it for some reason. Why would we?

My point is this. Wether or not you agree with him leaving guns out, it was all of us understanding them and their potential dangers in inexperienced hands that kept us from messing with them. My main point was always this: if you have guns, teach your children about them, and make sure they know the dangers.

This isn’t an excuse to be reckless, and obviously you should be aware of your children and their surroundings as your job as a parent, but at no point did any of us (7 of us) try anything, because we had no reason to.",t3_9r4dlu
e8fd2uf,t1_e8f8iir,"Well, it is a tool. It’s designed to do one thing, and that’s fire a projectile to damage whatever it’s aiming at. This also makes it a weapon.

The main thing is that you want your kids to *understand* guns, not to fear them, and using the word “tool” gives a different connotation than “weapon.” Make sure they understand how serious using a firearm is, but not that they need to be afraid of one when it’s around.

After all, a tool is just a tool. It’s the one operating it that causes the danger.",t3_9r4dlu
e8eq5ib,t1_e8eisaw,"Thank you for not giving us some bullshit like ""not knowing makes the story better"" like some authors do in this sub. ",t3_9r4dlu
e8ejagh,t1_e8eisaw,but why did they tell him the code?,t3_9r4dlu
e8eobex,t1_e8en8l4,"Thanks for answering! I still think that leaving your guns around is a bad idea, but was just curious about why someone would do that in the first place.

Thanks for not responding snarkily!",t3_9r4dlu
e8q8ayc,t1_e8fgywh,"Okay, maybe not an asshole but an idiot for sure. Would you trust your child to not do something just because you told them not to?",t3_9r4dlu
e8q8447,t1_e8fj6oo,You just don't leave guns lying around children. It is irrelevant whether the children are smart enough to understand the dangers of messing with a gun.,t3_9r4dlu
e8fgq5l,t1_e8fd2uf,Good point! Thanks.,t3_9r4dlu
e8f8935,t1_e8eq5ib,That usually means they don’t know either. You’re welcome.,t3_9r4dlu
e8eztpr,t1_e8eobex,"It's clear to me that the parent clearly wasn't irresponsible if he did that good of a job instill gun safety in to their children.

The problem comes from parents taking an abstinence-only approach to gun education, where you don't know about guns or see guns or talk about guns.

Also makes sense if he's a marine, there's always a chance you're too far away from your gun when an emergency does happen. ",t3_9r4dlu
e8qg7sy,t1_e8q8ayc,No I wouldn’t. I do agree there. Just not the way you put it.,t3_9r4dlu
e8tuf3p,t1_e8q8447,"I’m not sure I understand your rationale, but I don’t think the way he did so was dangerous. We may have to agree to disagree.

If a child is smart enough not to mess around with a gun though, what is the harm? If you had a gun in front of you, would you mess with it? No, I would assume not. So if we knew what it was and not to mess with it, (we were shown how it operates and how to use and clean it before, so we weren’t curious about it) why was it dangerous? Because we might mess around with it anyway?

I don’t mean to sound condescending with any of this, I just genuinely want to know what is wrong with it based on your rationale, as it’s always important to understand the opposites of your beliefs.",t3_9r4dlu
e9chvpw,t1_e8tuf3p,"A child is never smart enough in my opinion. Would you trust a child with a million dollars? Then why trust him with a weapon that can potentially be even more harmful than losing a million dollars? Let's just agree to disagree.
