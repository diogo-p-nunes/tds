ec8zmak,t3_a86mzp,"Psalm 82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
Edit: ....well-written, good job. One of the more enjoyable ones I've read. I actually did Operation Christmas Child every year as a kid.",t3_a86mzp
ec8utrj,t3_a86mzp,"The Good Lord made man, but Sam Colt made them equal.",t3_a86mzp
ec8dpwk,t3_a86mzp,Masterfully written with a most unconventional twist! I'd say this story is going to be a strong contender for this year's title.,t3_a86mzp
ec8m5cv,t3_a86mzp,"Wow, that was a good read.",t3_a86mzp

ec8nyuy,t3_a86mzp,"Ngl, I don’t get it",t3_a86mzp
ec8dmnt,t3_a86mzp,"Wow! That's all I can say! Just, wow! ",t3_a86mzp
ec90n4j,t3_a86mzp,Holy shit this was brilliant.,t3_a86mzp
ec990al,t3_a86mzp,"Well written. It takes skill to blend current issues and real social commentary with fictional “scary stories”. The genre of “ripped from the headlines” definitely has a dark little corner here. And a welcomed one.

ec8z9wa,t1_ec8wvwz,"Thanks so much for this comment, really means a lot :)",t3_a86mzp
ec8z38x,t1_ec8nyuy,The inspector was going to reject the box up until the point reality reminded her there are creeps everywhere.,t3_a86mzp
ec8q2f1,t1_ec8nyuy,"From what I understand I think Jerry is a sexual predator, and since he is a supervisor there are kids under his care? Idk It's kind of confusing",t3_a86mzp

ec8rfmm,t1_ec8q2f1,"What I was going for is that Jerry's assault is a reminder to the narrator that the shoebox sender was right, so she decides to let the weapon-filled box be shipped instead of reporting it. Narrator is an adult (hence the university volunteers line).

Sorry if it was confusing, I definitely could have made it a lot clearer with a bigger word count.",t3_a86mzp
eccfcuy,t1_ecayfad,Thank you T_T. This is really touching,t3_a86mzp
ec98bjf,t1_ec97kpa,[removed],t3_a86mzp
ec8uvsv,t1_ec8rfmm,I understood. Good writing.,t3_a86mzp
ec9isqd,t1_ec8rfmm,"Tbh it was pretty clear, I think it was well done and I usually have a hard time following story/events",t3_a86mzp
ec8shve,t1_ec8rfmm,oh...oh ok i thought it was the supervisor for the kids for some reason :/,t3_a86mzp
eca00di,t1_ec8rfmm,"So just to be clear, it was to get Jerry in trouble? ",t3_a86mzp
ec98v9w,t1_ec98bjf,[removed],t3_a86mzp
ec8v6vt,t1_ec8uvsv,"Happy to hear it, thanks :)",t3_a86mzp
ecauuff,t1_eca00di,"No. The narrator allowed the weapons-filled package to be shipped so that an impoverished child could receive weapons to protect and defend themselves from predators like Jerry. Basically, when Jerry sexually harassed the narrator, the narrator began to agree with the beliefs of the sender of the weapons-filled package (i.e. that children need to have the ability to protect themselves with weapons).",t3_a86mzp
