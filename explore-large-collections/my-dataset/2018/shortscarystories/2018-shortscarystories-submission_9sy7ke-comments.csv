e8t6a6l,t3_9sy7ke,"EXPLANATION (SPOILERS)

The way I see it, the story is a cryptic way of saying humanity is an experiment by God and every version of the experiment fails. The man on top of the tower is singing and crying, because he knows that he is part of the last version of the experiment and that it will fail like every other version has.",t3_9sy7ke
e8sg0dv,t3_9sy7ke,"Nice Borges feel to this. Congrats, I’ll be following you from now on ",t3_9sy7ke
e8shy08,t3_9sy7ke,"Nice. I like the ~~insert~~ message. Reading through it at first, I wasn't sure how it was supposed to be horror, but when I figured it out I was impressed. ",t3_9sy7ke
e8srmoc,t3_9sy7ke, Same here I’m not sure what his story is trying to say I read it five times and I’m still very lost.     Explain please. ,t3_9sy7ke
e8tebw2,t3_9sy7ke,"Great story. I'm amazed... do you hold like a literature degree or a language degree, because this short story is fascinating and inspiring. I hope you will post more short stories.",t3_9sy7ke
e8squdq,t3_9sy7ke,I don't understand. Time travel?,t3_9sy7ke
e8tld8w,t3_9sy7ke,"Ambiguity in a story is always tricky to pull off, and it took me a few read throughs (and a bit of helpful explanation by the author) to figure out exactly what was going on. Finding the balance between keeping the reader in suspense and not giving away too much is a fine line, and certainly not one I'd claim to have found. 
That being said, I definitely like the idea - the existential horror of one individual understanding the inevitability of not only their own personal destruction, but that of the whole world they know, is very compelling. 

As for the writing quality (imagery, language etc) I thought it was great. Good work.

Tl:dr - really liked it once I'd had a helping hand with understanding the implication of what was happening. That might just be me being thick though. Good job! ",t3_9sy7ke
e8sqzix,t3_9sy7ke,dont get it lol,t3_9sy7ke
e8sqv5r,t1_e8shy08,Might u explain to me a bit?,t3_9sy7ke
e8sr2dd,t1_e8sqv5r,Look at the italicized word at the end of each paragraph. ,t3_9sy7ke
e8tg3jl,t1_e8sr2dd,"Uhm, I’ve seen it and assume that whenever a world ends, another spawns. The iterations continue, right?",t3_9sy7ke
e8tg7ot,t1_e8tg3jl,"Sort of. The italicized words put together say ""Experiment reset after critical failure"". That sentence and the last paragraph are the main creators of the horror factor. ",t3_9sy7ke
e8tglce,t1_e8tg7ot,"Hmmm, *thinks hard* Does that means, we are all living in a giant experiment, and this, this one man becomes the sole person to be aware of it? Hence he weeps for the existence of man, as lab rats or toys?",t3_9sy7ke
e8tgo8n,t1_e8tglce,"Yes. And then it's my interpretation that he spreads his knowledge, hence a catastrophic failure.",t3_9sy7ke
