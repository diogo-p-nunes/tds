ecja5gl,t1_ec5z94m,"The only one that really tripped me up was

> It was then become a race with the time for the police

Here you'd want to drop either the ""become"", or change ""was then"" to ""had"", so it's ""It was then a race"" or ""It had become a race"" (or ""it became a race"").

And for the ""with the time"" bit, maybe ""against time""?  So like

> It became a race against time for the police

or 

>It was then a race against time for the police

I'm not an English expert though, despite it being my primary language.  Just a suggestion.",t3_a7tzwj
