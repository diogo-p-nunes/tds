e917ait,t3_9u3r78,"It's my first attempt at writing. Any pointers, advice is appreciated ",t3_9u3r78
e921vwx,t3_9u3r78,You know what? I'm rooting for this woman.,t3_9u3r78
e91if3x,t3_9u3r78,"Absolutely loved it. Also, I'm always looking out for the twist but didn't see this coming. Great job",t3_9u3r78
e91d2qq,t3_9u3r78,"That was really cool, didn't see it coming",t3_9u3r78
e92mrjr,t3_9u3r78,"I've known guys like that.  BRB, getting my shovel to help hide the body. ",t3_9u3r78
e92787h,t3_9u3r78,"I enjoyed this story a lot, and twist was fantastic!",t3_9u3r78
e91dv0i,t3_9u3r78,Really good. I didn't see the ending coming.,t3_9u3r78
e91gk94,t3_9u3r78,I like it! ,t3_9u3r78
e91rbrn,t3_9u3r78,Excellent! Enjoyed it from start to finish.,t3_9u3r78
e91u8pb,t3_9u3r78,Nice twist!,t3_9u3r78
e91z0rt,t3_9u3r78,Nice! I love stories I can't predict. This totally caught me by surprise.,t3_9u3r78
e91idqw,t3_9u3r78,Ahh good twist!,t3_9u3r78
e937rdt,t3_9u3r78,Hmmmm I kind‚Äôve predicted the twist. It‚Äôs just that it was set up so much that the woman was expected to be the victim I was pretty sure she would end up winning. Good story though,t3_9u3r78
e93n4xi,t3_9u3r78,"Great twist, stainless steel blade too. Nice work, very enjoyable. Thanks for posting.",t3_9u3r78
e97s24p,t3_9u3r78,This is good. :D,t3_9u3r78
e99j24p,t3_9u3r78,"Oh wow I really didn't see that coming! great job, write more please!",t3_9u3r78
e9m1jpi,t3_9u3r78,Awesome! Got me unprevented! ,t3_9u3r78
e93ej5t,t3_9u3r78,"It‚Äôs probably just me, I‚Äôm a frequenter here, but I saw the twist coming since here.

>	The sound of my heels hitting against the cemented floor echoed as I walked towards the car.

‚ÄúThe car‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmy car‚Äù is a giveaway.",t3_9u3r78
e91k47p,t1_e917ait,I was really hoping it turned out this way,t3_9u3r78
e91xqw6,t1_e917ait,"I love it! Would never guess it was your first attempt. 

I saw the twist, but only because it was what I was hoping for. When I read ‚Äúput my head down‚Äù it painted a really great image in my mind of a girl feeling really defeated, then instantly that image changed to a calm and calculated killer waiting for her prey. ",t3_9u3r78
e94iv8w,t1_e917ait,"Great story! But this is your FIRST attempt at writing? Well, la-dee-Frickin'-da! We got ourselves a writer here! Hey Dad, I can't see real good, is that Bill Shakespeare over there?",t3_9u3r78
e92i7ow,t1_e921vwx,"Haha, me too! Thanks! ",t3_9u3r78
e91ijw2,t1_e91if3x,Thank you! It means a lot,t3_9u3r78
e91gl6v,t1_e91d2qq,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e92xcq7,t1_e92mrjr,"Haha, looks like I found my partner in crime now!

Yeah, can't do much about them in real life, so I'm killing them off here",t3_9u3r78
e92i93p,t1_e92787h,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e91glrn,t1_e91dv0i,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e91gnzb,t1_e91gk94,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e92hz74,t1_e91rbrn,Thank you very much! ,t3_9u3r78
e92hznq,t1_e91u8pb,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e92i6u7,t1_e91z0rt,Thank you so much! I'm happy it did ,t3_9u3r78
e91ifuo,t1_e91idqw,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e93o3tm,t1_e937rdt,Thank you! Will try to cover it better next time ,t3_9u3r78
e93og5c,t1_e93n4xi,Thank you for your kind words! ,t3_9u3r78
e97uf4f,t1_e97s24p,Thank you üòä,t3_9u3r78
e99wny7,t1_e99j24p,"Thank you for the encouragement! I wrote a second story on this sub called, 'There are no winners here' but it's more of a sad story than scary / horror. 

I'm still learning, so unfortunately I can't promise consistency. I'll try my best. Thanks again üòä",t3_9u3r78
e9m52jg,t1_e9m1jpi,Thank you! ,t3_9u3r78
e93o5a6,t1_e93ej5t,"Haha, true. I didn't know how to cover it up ",t3_9u3r78
e91ka3j,t1_e91k47p,Ah nice! I hope the twist and the story wasn't ruined for you though! ,t3_9u3r78
e92j5ns,t1_e91xqw6,Thank you! I was going for that! I'm happy that you loved it,t3_9u3r78
e94tx2j,t1_e94iv8w,"Haha, thank you so much! I have written technical reports before, but never fiction. ",t3_9u3r78
e970322,t1_e92i7ow,\#metoo,t3_9u3r78
e91hqvy,t1_e91gnzb,Ur welcome! At first I thought typical dumb girl story... then wait! Cool girl kick ass story lol ,t3_9u3r78
e949w4t,t1_e93o3tm,"Please don't. Many stories have been ruined by a completely out of the blue twist. It's an enjoyable story, even if you see the ending coming. A twist can be fun, but good writing is so much better, and you did just that ",t3_9u3r78
e93o95j,t1_e93o5a6,"Doesn‚Äôt take anything away from your story though. 

I was actively looking for a tell and found it. It‚Äôs a thing most people would only catch on a re-read.",t3_9u3r78
e97rqqt,t1_e93o5a6,"I'm going to agree here.  Having a tell like that which someone might not notice until their second reading is a good thing.  That said I didn't notice it and was expecting her to ""accidentally"" run him over because it was so dark.",t3_9u3r78
e91ksd9,t1_e91ka3j,"No, if she didn't kill him, I'd have been like, ""damn.""",t3_9u3r78
e91hzco,t1_e91hqvy,"Haha, yes. I was going for that.

That's why she tries to make the car look like how it was before she sat, puts her head down, etc. Thought that it will look like she's paranoid but in reality she was trying to hide. ",t3_9u3r78
e94sp5w,t1_e949w4t,Thank you for the compliment! I love your stories on this sub ,t3_9u3r78
e97uhbx,t1_e97rqqt,Thank you! That ending is good and wholesome too! ,t3_9u3r78
e91j3r1,t1_e91hzco,Yep that‚Äôs exactly how I read it ! So mission accomplished ,t3_9u3r78
e956wtd,t1_e94sp5w,"Thank you, that's very nice of you. I'm an average writer at best compared to the big ones here, so that's a rare compliment for me",t3_9u3r78
