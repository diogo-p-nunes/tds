ec85hd0,t3_a7zfl7,"A few formatting errors, but otherwise a solid concept. The fact that this is something that actually happens in less prosperous parts of the world makes this story doubly frightening.",t3_a7zfl7
ec7zwyg,t3_a7zfl7,I loved it. That’s the horror of the holidays when you’re broke and hungry. I’ve had times where it felt like that with my pennies and dimes at the grocery store. ,t3_a7zfl7
ecg3gwo,t3_a7zfl7,"What a creative idea. With overpopulation, rising costs and diminished value, I can easily (and sadly) see a near-future like this.",t3_a7zfl7
ec7fdy8,t3_a7zfl7,Ohhhh ok?,t3_a7zfl7
ec8o991,t1_ec85hd0,"Thank you, yes i was trying to convey how awful it would be if it happened in the parts of the world we live in, where we more or less take it for granted that when we go shopping there will be a huge choice of good food.",t3_a7zfl7
ec8ihb2,t1_ec85hd0,True. Probably this is how Venezuela is celebrating right now. ,t3_a7zfl7
ec8o718,t1_ec7zwyg,Thank you.I've also been in that situation.,t3_a7zfl7
ec7fq7z,t1_ec7fdy8,did you like the story?,t3_a7zfl7
ec85jx7,t1_ec7fq7z,I didnt understand it.... lol,t3_a7zfl7
ec8okbf,t1_ec85jx7,"Its about a society, supposedly the society we live in, where the prices of food has soared way above what people can afford, and not only that, what food there is is very scarce, so the people are happy one day a year when the food prices are greatly reduced, they still cant afford it on their normal wages and have to take out bank loans to be able to afford it, but things are so bad in this society that even having stale week old bread is a luxury, and they can only manage to buy it when there are these huge price reductions.

The horror is in thinking, if that is, to their way of thinking, a good meal that they are having once a year at best, a meal that is so good that they will fight other people for it, what the hell are they eating the rest of the year?And don't forget, they will be short of money for the rest of the year too, from paying off the bank loan they took out to buy the bread.",t3_a7zfl7
