e8nsdo5,t3_9sc8qf,"Sort of like a condensed and more brutal Hunger Games. Very vivid descriptions, I was immediately sucked in. Nice work!",t3_9sc8qf
e8nzwmz,t3_9sc8qf,"this is my favourite story I've read on here in a while, you really got me with that twist I had no clue. I also love the hostel movies so I definitely saw that inspiration in the story.

e8p6yug,t3_9sc8qf,oooo I wonder did they know? Were they trying to kill the other one quickly so that it was less painful than being turned into a sausage?,t3_9sc8qf
e8odeuf,t3_9sc8qf,Brutal! Good job,t3_9sc8qf
e8ou6nl,t3_9sc8qf,Oh damn. That was really good!,t3_9sc8qf
e8nxg3w,t1_e8nsdo5,"Glad that you liked it!

I thought of Hunger Games but I was based more on some kind of Hostel movies. IIRC some really rich people were buying random people and making them 'dissapear' completely only to be used at really horrific and cruel fantasious purposes.

It's also a reminder of what could have happened (and still does, maybe?) to all of those people that go to other countries to try and get a job and then they suddently 'dissapear' without leaving a trace and nobody really goes after them because they are random common joes. Quite scary and sad at the same time.",t3_9sc8qf

e8p814r,t1_e8p6yug,"Yeah, they did see the meat grinders on the sides but the reader didn't knew (on purpose!) until the last moment. That was the twist, the holder of the weapon could choose which person would suffer less, but at least one really painful death was inevitable regardless. Considering they were best friends, they were indeed fighting over not letting each other suffer.",t3_9sc8qf
e8oeluq,t1_e8nxg3w,"It made me think of Jigsaw. 

SPOILERS 
Specifically the trap with the shotgun where when the woman tried to shoot the man, it turned out to be rigged to shoot the holder instead. The key to unlock them was in the shell, and thus destroyed",t3_9sc8qf
e8p8a8w,t1_e8p814r,"ahhhh I like it!!, (I'm a tad slow sometimes if it was obvious to others - sorry!)",t3_9sc8qf
e8oi5oa,t1_e8oeluq,"While I see why you thought of that movie, the thing with Jigsaw is that, while that man has obviously some kind of sick side with those cruel choice games, he at least shows some sense of morals when he only get people that were guilty of something bad. Also, he generally gives them a chance of escaping and atoning, even if small and arguably, traumatic.

This kind of game though, it's pure cruelty, aimed to please the bored and twisted rich people that had paid for it.",t3_9sc8qf
e8p8ev2,t1_e8p8a8w,No problem! Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_9sc8qf
e8oi75r,t1_e8oi5oa,"Which is a far worse evil, I like it ",t3_9sc8qf
