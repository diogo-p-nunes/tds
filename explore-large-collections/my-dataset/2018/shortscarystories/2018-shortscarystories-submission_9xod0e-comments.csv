e9uqta0,t3_9xod0e,I actually thought it was from the point of view of a turkey at first.,t3_9xod0e
e9tukj7,t3_9xod0e,"This was really good.  It wasnâ€™t clear which species was the narrator, and I love the descriptions you presented.  Good job.",t3_9xod0e
e9w2sfr,t3_9xod0e,ok I thought this story was AMAZING anyway but I only realised there was something about the title after reading the comments and...it just clicked...YOUR WRITING IS SICK BRO!!!!,t3_9xod0e
e9ueh3h,t3_9xod0e,"This was excellent! The title didn't give it away (for me at least, being from the UK it's not a phrase I've come across before). It was clear that it was being narrated from an unconventional perspective but it still kept me guessing and the writing style was great. Would have been easy to make it melodramatic but you tread the line perfectly. Upvoted! ",t3_9xod0e
e9uzepi,t3_9xod0e,"I loved this! It was so subtle, and had a great build up!",t3_9xod0e
e9tzpwu,t3_9xod0e,"Oh wow, that twist!!",t3_9xod0e
ea1xyy8,t3_9xod0e,"Love this story, I love the unconventional point of point of view and little words and phrases like ""Limb"" Or ""Cut free"" Well worth an upvote. I was wondering If I could narrate this story as part of a Thanksgiving special on my Youtube channel. It's all good if you don't want me to.",t3_9xod0e
e9uymlr,t1_e9uqta0,"Same here, it being the tree's POV was a welcome surprise.",t3_9xod0e

e9xq8oy,t1_e9uymlr,[Insert mandatory prequel quote here],t3_9xod0e
e9ty36k,t1_e9txwec,Thank god. I stared at this things in my drafts for about 2 days. I didn't want it to be obvious and could not think of a title to save my life. ,t3_9xod0e
e9ty3cj,t1_e9ty36k,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium[^*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmsbmeta/),t3_9xod0e
