e92z1j6,t1_e92yj68,"I feel like Freda is an imposter and we should know because of the eye color but I trusted the contact explanation.

Also I think the title is referencing a fairytale about two sisters, one was jealous and murdered the other one not super similar in plot but the good sister evil sister theme is still there",t3_9u94wm
