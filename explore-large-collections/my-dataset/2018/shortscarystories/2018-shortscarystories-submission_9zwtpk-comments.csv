eacu4s1,t3_9zwtpk,"This unsettled me far more than I expected it to. I always assumed if I ever got abducted that I’d be prepared to jump from a moving car. Then I read the seatbelt line and started thinking about how I’d use my lighter or keys to cut it. Then I started thinking about how I’d deal with a locked door or shatter-proof window and was stumped.

Basically, thanks for the nightmare hypotheticals (and nicely done).",t3_9zwtpk

eae5ej9,t1_eacu4s1,"At that point, wouldn’t it be easier to just slide out from under the seatbelt? It’s not very dignified and OP might lose a few buttons on the CK dress shirt in the process, but you know, freedom.


EDIT: working this out in my head, I think you can definitely slide out from under the top strap (the one that goes shoulder to waist), once that’s done, switch gears and work pull your legs out from the waist level strap by leaning to the side. This way, the dress shirt should be safe from button loss.

EDIT2: with some foresight, this can be even easier - once you free your upper body, that’s bound to create some slack in the belt. Now if you aren’t careful, you could lose that slack to the retracting mechanism, but if you pull on the belt as you get free, you can keep the slack. Then you simply pull all that slack into the waist portion of the belt, giving you plenty of room for an easy escape.",t3_9zwtpk
eae52cs,t1_eacu4s1,"Honestly I always Cary a knife and wouldn’t waste time on the belt just boom drivers dead and your more than likely to survive a car crash than jumping out of a car. 

But still the story was really chilling  and really realistic in a sense.",t3_9zwtpk
