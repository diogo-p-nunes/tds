e9zfa7f,t3_9y7rdc,"The story referenced here is actually by Roald Dahl, and the woman uses frozen lamb as a murder weapon and then cooks it and serves it to the detectives.. she doesn’t cook her husband and serve him. The way that this story is written implies that the hitman character and the woman in the Dahl story use the same method of killing and disposal of the murder weapon. ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zsz7g,t3_9y7rdc,"Oh, the potential for /r/unclejokes! ""Eating ur mom"", ""you need to get some of my wife's ass"", ""That woman really got inside me""....",t3_9y7rdc
e9zm97c,t3_9y7rdc,"Oooh, I like this one. The cannibalism trope is pretty frequently done here, but you managed to make it fresh again. I love the angle you took with the killer being a hitman who believes he’s in the right",t3_9y7rdc
e9zr9r8,t3_9y7rdc,I love all these long pig stories ,t3_9y7rdc

e9z8zxw,t1_e9z7rnk,Thank you for the feedback! I'm new to writing and I'm unable to judge my stories. I'll try to define the story more next time. ,t3_9y7rdc
e9zfnqq,t1_e9zfa7f,"Thank you! You saved me from a major embarrassment - I have changed it.

I meant to say that it inspired the narrator (and me to write this story). That's why he disposes the bodies by serving them at parties. They aren't similar. ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zfpzg,t1_e9zfa7f,I see why you said that - because of the reference in the third para? I'll change the story a bit then. Thank you - it was a good catch. ,t3_9y7rdc
ebdbmt6,t1_e9zsz7g,"Yeah, never thought of this :) ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zmh2a,t1_e9zm97c,Thank you! ,t3_9y7rdc
e9zrpfs,t1_e9zr9r8,"Haha, me too-thank you! ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zedgt,t1_e9ze0e5,"Sure. The narrator is a hitman who takes up contract killing round the year but does it for free for few people during the holidays. He disposes the bodies of his victims by cutting them up and serving them as meat in his Thanksgiving party. This year, his wife (who is unaware of his actual job) decides to leave him for someone else. So he decides to kill her and serve her as a dish for his guests. ",t3_9y7rdc

e9zib88,t1_e9zfnqq,No problem at all! Thanks for clearing up that part of the story too. ,t3_9y7rdc
e9zeuhd,t1_e9zedgt,"This was inspired by A Lamb to the Slaughter by Roald Dahl. In this story, a woman kills her husband who is a policeman because he plans to leave her for another woman, even though she's carrying his child. She then cooks the murder weapon (a piece of lamb) and calls his friends, who are policemen who work with the dead husband, and reports that she found him dead. They search for the murder weapon without any luck and she finally feeds them the lamb piece for their hard work :D ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zh9sp,t1_e9zgpxj,"Thanks for the compliment! Your stories have very good concept. They also show that you're creative and have good imagination! Keep writing, keep dreaming up new plots and you'll definitely surpass this in no time :) ",t3_9y7rdc
e9zil1i,t1_e9zib88,Please let me know if there's anything else - I started writing just two weeks ago and sometimes I find it difficult to translate what I have in mind onto words (or how they maybe interpreted by the reader) ,t3_9y7rdc
ea0iwvd,t1_e9zeuhd,Just an FYI - the short story is called “Lamb to the Slaughter”. ,t3_9y7rdc

e9zlpej,t1_e9zil1i,I've read several of your posts on Reddit and enjoyed them. I'm no writer's critic so I won't have any useful suggestions -  except keep writing. You're pretty good now and you'll get better.,t3_9y7rdc
ea0ogjj,t1_ea0iwvd,Very true - I should've googled it once before writing. Thank you! I've changed it. ,t3_9y7rdc
e9zqgo7,t1_e9zmyne,Trust me - I hadn't even read Harry Potter when I was your age,t3_9y7rdc
e9zm7ll,t1_e9zlpej,Thank you for the encouragement! I remember you had commented on another post too. ,t3_9y7rdc
