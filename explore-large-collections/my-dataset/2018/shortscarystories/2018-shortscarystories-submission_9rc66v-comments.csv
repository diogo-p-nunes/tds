e8ihnmg,t1_e8h6nda,"There was a Reddit thread on general anesthesia as a conspiracy theory some months ago. They were suggesting that nobody knows exactly how anesthetics work (but they do work) and that maybe they work by not allowing you to form new memories temporarily, so you could actually be in terrible pain during surgery, but you don't remember it. 

I find that idea horrifying. ",t3_9rc66v
