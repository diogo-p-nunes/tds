eckayk2,t3_a9j8r9,"I feel like the phrase ""our young species"" in the first paragraph gives away the twist.  Humans aren't particularly young, especially compared to machines.",t3_a9j8r9

eckc0q7,t3_a9j8r9,"Very well done! Even if someone sees the ending coming (likely due only to the fact that's it's known the story is short), they still can't really peg what you did.

I like the twist and how you handled it.",t3_a9j8r9

This gave away the ending for me. Otherwise the last line would have been a great reveal.

Really liked the story though.",t3_a9j8r9

eckmev2,t3_a9j8r9,"Confused?! It was a human killing a robot with a baseball bat right?? Playing on the concept that humans perceive robots as evil and violent when we in fact are the evil violent ones ourselves.... right?? 
Great story the fear is feeling as if robots will be our downfall and we should fear them but also knowing that their evil only comes from the fact that WE created them and the evil came from us.... ",t3_a9j8r9

eckd9vt,t1_eckayk2,"Seconded, although the theme is compelling enough to overcome the doubt for some. ",t3_a9j8r9
eckmwul,t1_eckayk2,"It depends on what you consider to be young. One could argue, comparing the scientific theories about our planets age of about 4.6 billion years and our species age of only about [6,000 years](http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Eplaisted/ce/humanity.html), our species is not only new in comparison, but an insignificant dot on the timeline of our planet. We’re a lot later than most people realize. It’s a shame well probably find a way to wipe ourselves out before we reach our true potential. ",t3_a9j8r9
eclaa2z,t1_eckayk2,"He kind of switches back and forth making it seem like the narrator is both… “terrifying automatons” 

Makes it even better",t3_a9j8r9
eckog7n,t1_eckayk2,"It’s a great example of foreshadowing..  obvious in hindsight, but easily glossed over at time of reading. Well done!",t3_a9j8r9
