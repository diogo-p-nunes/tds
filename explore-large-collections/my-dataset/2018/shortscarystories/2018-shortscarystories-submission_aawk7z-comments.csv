It kept me interested throughout and it was a nice change of pace to see in this subreddit. Good work, OP!",t3_aawk7z

Hope you enjoyed it! I visited a place which is literally called The Place of Kings. Hence, all the royalty themed stories :D it was so interesting to look at the artillery! ",t3_aawk7z
ecvlmty,t1_ecvl6vu,Thank you very much :) I was worried if I had packed in too many things into a short story. ,t3_aawk7z
ecvnnoi,t1_ecvlmty,"I don't believe so! I think if you were to add anything else it would be a bit much, but you did a good job with the construction of it all. :)",t3_aawk7z
edbo4nk,t1_ecvlmty,"You did pack in a lot, but you did it gracefully and perfectly. Not many short story writers can accomplish that. Don't worry, it was wonderful and amazingly balanced!",t3_aawk7z
