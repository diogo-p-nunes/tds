e8n9g4r,t3_9s6t0q,"I went up to the ""when fate calls me"" paragraph picturing a nice guy. The only reason I figured out it was death before the big reveal was that I knew there had to be misdirect.

I love your writing style and the idea of Death being compassionate rather than uncaring and callous.",t3_9s6t0q
e8nb4dw,t3_9s6t0q,I absolutely love this. Beautiful. Such an interesting perspective on death. ,t3_9s6t0q
e8nmilk,t3_9s6t0q,"Come on baby, don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man",t3_9s6t0q
e8nqhnc,t3_9s6t0q,I saved this before I got to the end. Don't want to die but this story really hit some nerves :) ,t3_9s6t0q
e8q5we2,t3_9s6t0q,"I caught it at ""Too skinny, too tall, the one who makes everyone feel awkward. The one everyone does their best to ignore."" Still, a great read. Interesting personification of Death...",t3_9s6t0q
e8nkqjx,t3_9s6t0q,"Beautiful, and so sad, it sent chills down my spine and I got goosebumps  ",t3_9s6t0q
e8p65cy,t3_9s6t0q,"Credit to Terry Pratchett for the idea of a likable Grim Reaper and Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore, and George David Weiss (writers of 'falling in love with you') - specifically the line ""take my hand, take my whole life too"" ",t3_9s6t0q
ecg0h2d,t3_9s6t0q,This is beautifully written but when you linked it from another comment I already knew it was death from the comment :( ,t3_9s6t0q
e8mjpyo,t1_e8mja4q,Thanks! ,t3_9s6t0q
e8mmc0f,t1_e8mm43w,"Haha - I was hoping it would be a bit of a mislead to start with, that it would be easy to think that this was the self righteous ramblings of a m'lady uttering 'nice guy'. But I'm confident the Grim Reaper wouldn't wear a fedora ",t3_9s6t0q
e8njyak,t1_e8n9g4r,Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it. I should credit Terry Pratchett for the idea of Death having more of a personality than we assume. Tried to put a bit of a different spin on it though ,t3_9s6t0q
e8njyix,t1_e8nb4dw,Thanks. Glad you enjoyed it! ,t3_9s6t0q
e8nt99s,t1_e8nqhnc,Hope it wasn't too grim,t3_9s6t0q

ecg3jec,t1_ecg0h2d,"Haha yeah, sorry about that. I couldn't think of a way to link it without giving it away",t3_9s6t0q
e8mtw53,t1_e8mmc0f,And he might be able to pull it off if he did anyway,t3_9s6t0q
e8nw9eo,t1_e8nt99s,No was perfectly timed ðŸ‘Œ parts I needed to head right then lol,t3_9s6t0q
e9fy7o7,t1_e9fxh45,Think he's probably mine too,t3_9s6t0q
ech2rsz,t1_ecg3jec,Awesome story regardless! ,t3_9s6t0q
e8mubvq,t1_e8mtw53,It'd definitely look better on him than the typical basement dweller,t3_9s6t0q
