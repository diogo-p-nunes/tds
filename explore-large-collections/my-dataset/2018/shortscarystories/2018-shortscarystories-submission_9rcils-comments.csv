e8h3f9h,t3_9rcils,"Mary had a little lamb
She tied it to the heater
And every time it turned around

She had a fluffy bunny.

e8igy3o,t1_e8hwo3m,"Guess I wasn't the first one to come up with this idea! I swear I never saw the other post though, only started following this subreddit in the last 6 months or so.",t3_9rcils

e8ixr5d,t1_e8gqqyz,There's been quite a few stories almost identical to this one over the past couple years.,t3_9rcils
e8jqauc,t1_e8gqqyz,Oh really? I think that would be easy to check by looking through OP's post history,t3_9rcils
e8gwli0,t1_e8gnejv,I assumed nothing. I *consumed* that lamb's gender.,t3_9rcils
e8h56xc,t1_e8gwli0,How dare you. That lamb considered itself genderless. ,t3_9rcils
e8hmgwo,t1_e8h56xc,"I didn't exactly sit down for a good conversation with that lamb.

The meat was there. So I eated it.",t3_9rcils
