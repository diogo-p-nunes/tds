ebi84dk,t3_a4unq1,No series posts.,t3_a4unq1
ebhq9k3,t3_a4unq1,I believe it was your father. The motive fits and the fact that you were stabbed 17 times hints at a crime of passion,t3_a4unq1
ebhr7vm,t3_a4unq1,You were stabbed 17 times but no DNA whatsoever was found on the murder weapon? Are you made of stainless steel?,t3_a4unq1
ebhxdcv,t3_a4unq1,Maybe it wasnâ€˜t one of the suspects?! Tell us about your mom,t3_a4unq1
ebhztg3,t3_a4unq1,It was your step mum cos you told her about the cheating.,t3_a4unq1
ebhqkhv,t1_ebhq9k3,That is a good theory!!,t3_a4unq1
ebhsiq9,t1_ebhr7vm,"No unfortunately not! 
The police said the knife had been washed and Heated up to a very high temperature causing the DNA to dissapear.",t3_a4unq1
ebhxo89,t1_ebhxdcv,"She died during child birth, my birth to be exact. I do not remember her. ",t3_a4unq1
ebi05i4,t1_ebhztg3,That is a good theory! But why would she come back to kill me?,t3_a4unq1
ebht6gq,t1_ebhsiq9,Suspicious! Then how did the police determine that the knife is the murder weapon? Where did they find the knife? Why did your murderer go to all this trouble to destroy the DNA evidence instead of simply getting rid of the knife?,t3_a4unq1
ebhxz5v,t1_ebhxo89,"> My sister Emaulea... asked my mother many times if she would get the insurance money

Is your sister a medium?

Also didn't your father just cheat on your mother? And she left him because of that?",t3_a4unq1
ebhy4bp,t1_ebhxo89,wait but then how did you expose your dad to her?,t3_a4unq1
ebhtems,t1_ebht6gq,They found the knife in my dad's desk drawer and he said that Emanuela had given it to him clean. He also said that he thought Emanuela killed me with the knife. That is how the police got the idea that it was the murder weapon.,t3_a4unq1
ebhy4wj,t1_ebhxz5v,"It's like this. My sister is not a medium. My real mother died during child birth. My father remarried and forced us to call her mother. He cheated on her. My ""mother"" left my father for cheating.",t3_a4unq1
ebhy713,t1_ebhy4bp,"I told my ""mother"" about my dad's affair.",t3_a4unq1
ebhtoqd,t1_ebhtems,And what did Emanuela say about her father's accusation? Did she admit to possessing and giving him the knife?,t3_a4unq1
ebhu7n6,t1_ebhtoqd,"No, she did not! She told the police that she did not know about the knife and my father's story was never confirmed.",t3_a4unq1
ebhunwd,t1_ebhu7n6,"Emanuela found the body almost immediately after the murder. Your blood is literally on her hands. She hands your father a bloodied knife after your death and he's totally okay with cleaning it? It doesn't add up.

He's either the murderer, or an accomplice. J'accuse!",t3_a4unq1
ebhw2hm,t1_ebhunwd,I think they both played a role in it. But Emanuela was found holding my body shaking it so that is where the blood cane from.,t3_a4unq1
