ebflcj7,t3_9zotzr,Finally getting around to doing some narrations - [https://soundcloud.com/isaacstoker101/albion](https://soundcloud.com/isaacstoker101/albion),t3_9zotzr
ebypssi,t3_9zotzr,"*The Black Mist descends*

eabxy3i,t1_eabxbdu,Thanks! ,t3_9zotzr
ealswn9,t1_eachfwa,"Me too. The preoccupation humans seem to have with dragging big rocks around is odd. The pyramids, gobekli tepe, the burj dubai etc",t3_9zotzr

eabhwsq,t1_eab2mrs,Although megaliths werenâ€™t built by druids! But awesome nonetheless. You could change villages to crannogs if you want to go max Britannia ,t3_9zotzr
eabnj9m,t1_eabmral,[deleted],t3_9zotzr
eabi4qm,t1_eabhwsq,"I'm a bit of a renegade - like to play fast and loose with historical accuracy. Good call on the 'crannogs' - that's an awesome word, definitely going to work that in next time I do some pseudo-historical horror. And thanks, glad you liked it! ",t3_9zotzr
eabolos,t1_eabnj9m,"How dare you post the work of another author on a post of my original content. My scribblings are clearly far superior!

I am of course being both flippant and a moron.

The quotation above is a stunning use of language and its extremely flattering to be told I've written something that's even reminiscent of something as influential and timeless as Blake. Thank you! ",t3_9zotzr
