eaqezxn,t1_eaqenpq,"The *bean sí* (anglicized as banshee, and pronounced the same) is a piece of Irish mythology. She appears as a weeping woman outside of a house where someone is about to die, heralding the imminent demise.

In this case, she also weeps for young men about to go off to war and never come home.",t3_a1bz1g
