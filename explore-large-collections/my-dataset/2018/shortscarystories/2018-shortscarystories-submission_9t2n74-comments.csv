e8tlrrc,t3_9t2n74,Short and sweet. I like the approach of having a landlord who's unfazed by the horror and just wants to buy a place to rent out that isn't such a hassle. Makes for a refreshingly unconventional narrator. Good job,t3_9t2n74
e8uf3z3,t3_9t2n74,"Hello,

Great story. 

I’m kinda new at being a narrator and I don’t have fancy recording and/or video equipment (yet). But I would love to narrate your story and put it on my YouTube channel, with your permission ONLY, of course. The video will include a opening sequence, then me reading your story over a video piece, then a closing sequence, with a writing credit to you (Your Reddit username, unless otherwise specified).  If not, I understand and will not bother you any further. Please let me know, either way by replying to this comment. Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,

Michael P. Zendler
