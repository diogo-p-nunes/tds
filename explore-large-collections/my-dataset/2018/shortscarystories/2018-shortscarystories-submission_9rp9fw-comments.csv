e8j3gbi,t3_9rp9fw,Ooh I like this one! The ending is a bit predictable but still a good read.,t3_9rp9fw
e8k1u8v,t3_9rp9fw,"Now I‚Äôm thinking about what day I‚Äôd want to relive.

e8k3ei1,t3_9rp9fw,"I might say the day one of my kids was born, but I was smart enough to ask for an epidural sooooo ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",t3_9rp9fw

e8iv6s3,t1_e8isawo,"She requested to relive the birth of her child forever.

So she is. She goes through a long and intensely painful childbirth... but the loop restarts before she actually gets to hold her baby girl.

Some fucking harsh beans, man.",t3_9rp9fw
e8iv7zq,t1_e8isawo,"Think of Groundhog Day, except this woman is in labor.",t3_9rp9fw
e8o4ta0,t1_e8o1cre,Thanks!!,t3_9rp9fw
e8jgjua,t1_e8iv6s3,"Didn't the doctor said it's just past midnight? And she was promised to relive an entire day? Why was the loop shortened?

Or was this hell? But it wouldn't make sense, since why would she be given the option to relive her happiest day then? ",t3_9rp9fw
e8jhnuc,t1_e8jgjua,"Yes, it's Hell. It's a punishment where they take the bad moment of your happiest day and make you relive it over and over for eternity.

It's not that the loop was shortened, by ""day"", they mean moment. So it's more like you either relive your happiest moment or the worst moment of your happiest day forever.",t3_9rp9fw
e8jrcv4,t1_e8jgjua,"I took it to mean that her labor lasted for around 23.5 hours or something. 

I also think she was in hell, and it‚Äôs a monkey‚Äôs paw type of scenario. She‚Äôs excited for the birth of her child because it makes her look good, so she clearly isn‚Äôt that good of a person. Either that or there is no heaven and hell here, but the day you pick reflects what kind of person you are and you get what you deserve no matter what",t3_9rp9fw
