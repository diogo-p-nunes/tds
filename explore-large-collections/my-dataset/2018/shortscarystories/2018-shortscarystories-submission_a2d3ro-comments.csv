eaxggyw,t3_a2d3ro,"I gather that this is some sort of hell. But I don't understand why an 8-year-old girl is in Hell, or why her personal Hell involves spiders when she is demonstrably not afraid of them.",t3_a2d3ro
eax6tqt,t3_a2d3ro,What sins? Why is school hell for her?,t3_a2d3ro
eax7bu2,t3_a2d3ro,What did she do to the spider??,t3_a2d3ro
eax3x0j,t3_a2d3ro,Feedback is welcome! Thanks for reading. (Sorry for any mistakes. English is not my mother tongue),t3_a2d3ro
eb4d0sk,t3_a2d3ro,"Aww no the writing was absolutely fine, it was just the plot twist that I didn't understand. I didn't know if you'd left it open to interpretation or if there was something I was missing. If English is not your first language the writing was very good. I couldn't translate anything into another language so respect where respect is due.

Just a thought but this story would work well doing a longer version of it that goes into more detail.",t3_a2d3ro
eaxe0vj,t3_a2d3ro,"A little confusing as you do not mention what sins she could have committed. 

Also, you need to pick a verb tense and stick with it. It makes it difficult to read when the tense is switching between present and past like that. Keep in mind most stories are written in past tense as events have already occurred by the time you are reading them. ",t3_a2d3ro
eaxgl8w,t1_eax6tqt,Yeah removed the sins thing in an afterthought. I chose the school as her personal hell because for a lot of kids school is just like hell.,t3_a2d3ro
eaxcc2c,t1_eax3x0j,"I'm not sure if I understand what happened, could you please explain?",t3_a2d3ro
eaxf4ex,t1_eaxe0vj,Thanks for your feedback. I wanted to leave the sins thing a bit open (or atleast tried to leave it open) but I think I got your point. And I will try to stick to one tense next time (Corrected some of the tenses in the edit).,t3_a2d3ro
eaxepvx,t1_eaxcc2c,"Sorry for not writing clear (will try better in the future though). Actually I wanted to leave some room for interpretation. This girl is experiencing her personal hell because she sinned at some point in her life. Because she died at a young age, her personal hell is designed as a school (a lot of kids don't like school) with spiders in it (her current fear of spiders covering her body becomes reality).",t3_a2d3ro
