eb2514s,t3_a2tn8t,This is very well written. The story is obvious without overtly saying it. The mother has a realistic reaction (even if the child does not. Surely he knows what an alarm is) Very well written.,t3_a2tn8t
eb1iyh5,t3_a2tn8t,This is so very sad and beautifully written ,t3_a2tn8t
eb6b390,t3_a2tn8t,"Is nobody is going to mention the time I’m the times given?!?
3 minutes to ten?!
10:12?!
That’s his long it takes! (Approximately)
Whyyyy has nobody recognized this small genius detail? When that realization hit me, /u/Bernstein, I about had a heart attack. I want you to know that I actually stopped breathing when it hit me.",t3_a2tn8t
eba4iof,t3_a2tn8t,"Please take my upvote, this was excellent.",t3_a2tn8t
eb74ozk,t3_a2tn8t,"Horrifing, and sad at the same time.  Heart breaking premise. Excellent writting.",t3_a2tn8t
eb2ufhp,t1_eb2514s,"I think it's not that he doesn't know what an alarm is, but that he doesn't know what this specific alarm is.  There's a weird loud noise and he's curious about what it is and where it's coming from.",t3_a2tn8t
eb6f8rb,t1_eb6b390,I don't get it please explain.,t3_a2tn8t
eb73yu7,t1_eb6f8rb,"I forgot which group does this, but the ""countdown to midnight"" refers to how close the world is to WWIII. (i.e. we are screwed at midnight.) It is based upon how the politics/ world conflicts are going at a given time. The brilliant use of ""3 minutes to ten,"" and  the time ""10:12"" probably refers to the fifteen minutes warning we might get before the bombs fall, or possibly the time ""left"" until midnight. ",t3_a2tn8t
eb7432k,t1_eb6f8rb,/u/CatLady157 nailed it up to the end sentence. The fifteen minutes you have to prepare until the ICBMs reach us. The way the OP did it all is extraordinary.,t3_a2tn8t
eb8tidf,t1_eb7432k,OHHH okay thank you for explaining :),t3_a2tn8t
