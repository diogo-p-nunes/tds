ebk2e8j,t3_a55l2o,"Not sure if outright scary, but definitely emotional. Good story, I like the idea of a dog narrator.
 I am going to give my dog a hug now.",t3_a55l2o
ebkh3cx,t3_a55l2o,"So.. the owner won’t wake up because she “had to much to drink” aka is in a drunk coma. The dog scares off the attempted robbery/murder, except..there *is* that creepy undertone, which makes you wonder. Is the mommy not waking up because she’s asleep, or did the robber already kill her? ",t3_a55l2o
ebk7pay,t3_a55l2o,"good idea, needs paragraphs. at the beginning at least.

also, the ending... did the dog scare the stranger, or did he go 'cause he'd done his business?",t3_a55l2o
ebk8zxn,t1_ebk7pay,"I’m gonna assume that because of the sinister sounding end, with the whole “I love cuddling up with mommy” thing, that mommy’s dead ",t3_a55l2o
ebk9sg3,t1_ebk7pay,"Thanks! I actually meant it to be a happy ending, but I do subscribe to the idea that ends don't have to be happy so I like the idea that it can come off as ""sinister"" to be a bit more vague. ",t3_a55l2o
ebk9wtx,t1_ebk8zxn,I didn't mean the end to come off like that but I love the idea that it can have different interpretations. I like that. ,t3_a55l2o
ebkigq3,t1_ebk9sg3,"Oh, I was hoping I was wrong anyway that would’ve been sad haha",t3_a55l2o
ebkidjt,t1_ebk9wtx,"Yeah true, really well crafted story",t3_a55l2o
ebkk11o,t1_ebkidjt,"Thanks! I did edit out around 200 words from the original one down to fit the 500 word limit. I've posted stories to other pages where there's no limit, but I wanted to try and see if I could make it fit this page's requirements haha. ",t3_a55l2o
ebkykae,t1_ebkk11o,"Dm me the full sorry maybe? If it’s possible, idk I’m new to reddit",t3_a55l2o
ebliy7l,t1_ebkykae,I just posted it to another Reddit page that I post to if you go to my page it'll be there and a couple of other stories I've done. ,t3_a55l2o
