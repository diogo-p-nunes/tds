ecoei19,t1_ecoehk3,"**Bönnsch dialect**

Bönnsch is a Ripuarian dialect of German, which is spoken in Bonn and the bordering municipalities.

Bönnsch is very similar to the more northern Kölsch of Cologne and distinct from the latter only in particular points. One can find a main difference and some other features, which however do not occur among all speakers or are being levelled more and more due to the influence of Standard German and also Kölsch itself (which is more present in culture and broadcasting).

In private life (family, friends, clubs, local pubs etc.), the dialect is still used relatively frequently in the region.

ecpywsg,t1_ecp67yq,"Thank you!  I know I said there wouldn't be berries, but I worked them in there just for you.

I really wasn't sure what to make of these three, until I noticed that viburnum lantana is colloquially known as the *wayfarer* tree.  Then that combined with the (to me) foreign dialect and the cars to become a wandering road trip story.  Interestingly, this is my second story set on the nowhere highways of America.  Makes me wonder if my other character is anywhere nearby.....",t3_aa2c4h
ecq2yk9,t1_ecpywsg,"Thank youuuuu so much! The connections are really clever - I could never think so far, tbh!

I was reading some of your previous stories now (I'm new to reddit) - they are very good :)

Can you please give me a link to the story you mentioned? I don't think I have come across it yet. ",t3_aa2c4h
ecr2uto,t1_ecq2yk9,"Eh, my mind just makes weird leaps.  I've found it helps to just let it wander and see where it ends up.  The creative mind is great; five different people given the exact same prompt will produce five completely different stories.

Thanks, I enjoy writing my silly stories and am thrilled to have a place where I can share them.  I do have my own subreddit under my username if you haven't discovered it yet.  And welcome, if somewhat belatedly.

The other story is [Miles and Miles and Miles](https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/56vhja/miles_and_miles_and_miles/).",t3_aa2c4h
ecs97j3,t1_ecr2uto,"Yes, I saw it and have subscribed :)

I like it how dark thoughts and supernatural stuff are seen to be normal on this sub - makes me feel at home.

Thanks for the story!

Edit : I loved the story - it was scary! ",t3_aa2c4h
