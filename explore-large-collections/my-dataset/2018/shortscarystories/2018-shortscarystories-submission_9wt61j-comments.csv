e9nihf2,t3_9wt61j,"Not familiar with the inspiration, to be honest, but I think that gives the story that much more originality in my mind. 

Really enjoy your writing style, very detailed descriptions and powerful word use.  I could easily imagine the great and fearful dragons just as much as this new terrible ‚Äúman‚Äù in Victorian garb. I‚Äôd read more about this creature. 

Well done. ",t3_9wt61j
e9nk2bb,t3_9wt61j,"For some reason, this reminded me of Batman by gaslight! I think this would be an awesome concept for a new villain to add to Batman‚Äôs rogues, nice work OP üëçüèΩ",t3_9wt61j

e9nivnk,t1_e9nihf2,"Thanks very much! The reference is a touch obscure, so it's nice to know it's still an enjoyable read for someone who isn't quite as nerdy about archaic urban legends as I am. I actually thought this might work as a novella, or a series of short stories following old myths as they find themselves brought back into service in the modern (stretching the term to victorian London) era",t3_9wt61j
e9nk7dd,t1_e9nk2bb,Thanks! I could definitely see springheel Jack working as a comic boom villain ,t3_9wt61j
e9no11d,t1_e9njlmv,Bad bot.,t3_9wt61j
e9n86d6,t1_e9n7vmt,Springheel Jack! Should have gotten it with the jumping over buildings part.,t3_9wt61j

e9njsps,t1_e9nivnk,I‚Äôd read more!,t3_9wt61j

e9n8821,t1_e9n86d6,Someone get Bob a beer! ,t3_9wt61j
e9n9il6,t1_e9n9bh7,Indeed! That cheeky little Victorian prankster/indecent assault enthusiast,t3_9wt61j
e9n9q2o,t1_e9n9il6,"One of my favorites! I like the thought of him being a dragon. 

He didn‚Äôt violate women so much as kill them or scare the crap out of them. Right?",t3_9wt61j
e9nanau,t1_e9n9q2o,"From what I recall, he seemed prone to activities that Victorians might politely refer to as 'ravishing' - tearing blouses, stealing kisses etc. I thought he seemed to embody a lot of the same qualities as Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel - hedonistic, uninhibited, lustful etc, everything that's part of human nature which victorian society seemed bent on suppressing - which in turn seemed to be a lot of the same qualities dragons had in old legends. Hence the story - when dragons were no longer within the realm of possibility, they were replaced with new monsters that could 'exist' in the civilised world",t3_9wt61j
e9ngy1n,t1_e9nanau,Makes sense . Love the story. Brilliant!,t3_9wt61j
e9nhefu,t1_e9ngy1n,"Cheers, and thanks for making your way through that explanatory ramble",t3_9wt61j
e9nif96,t1_e9nhefu,"Love myths etc. so my pleasure, Sir.",t3_9wt61j
e9nj44a,t1_e9nif96,"Me too! It alway intrigued me why people living in eras when disease, famine, wild animals and a drunk, angry neighbour might kill you felt the need to make up stories about fictional things that could kill you. You'd think they had enough to worry about. But apparently there's something about human nature that compels us to take everything scary about ourselves, externalise it, and turn it into a monster lurking in the shadows",t3_9wt61j
e9nlt3i,t1_e9nj44a,"We do the same now. Urban legends, slasher flicks, sensation news. It‚Äôs just switched mediums.

Dealing with abstract fears and symbolic fears distracts us from the dangers and uncertainty of our own lives.

I find when I‚Äôm upset My writing goes darker more easily. Also if I am bored or feeling numb I go for creepy stories. Trying to feel something.",t3_9wt61j
e9nluxg,t1_e9nj44a,Odd question ...are you a fan of Doctor Who?,t3_9wt61j
e9o5sne,t1_e9nlt3i,Absolutely - I should have a ponder on why newer urban legends like slenderman seem to have captured the public imagination in the way that they have,t3_9wt61j
e9o5rnw,t1_e9nluxg,I've seen bits and pieces but was never a committed fan tbh,t3_9wt61j
e9oijv5,t1_e9o5sne,Yes!,t3_9wt61j
e9oinex,t1_e9o5rnw,Oh sorry! It‚Äôs just your screen name is a anagram of ‚ÄúOOD‚Äù which is a creature from Who.,t3_9wt61j
e9okcxf,t1_e9oinex,Ohh I see haha. It's not as imaginative as that I'm afraid - it's just part of my last name,t3_9wt61j
e9oumln,t1_e9okcxf,Oh well I feel stupid but so had to ask.,t3_9wt61j
e9ov170,t1_e9oumln,No worries! ,t3_9wt61j
