eaxfvxx,t3_a2ayti,nice story!,t3_a2ayti
eaxfuyt,t3_a2ayti,what kinda magic spell to use?,t3_a2ayti
eaxl4y2,t3_a2ayti,"Very nicely done. 

Iâ€™d suggest losing the last part about the being dead. Ends fine with the head going in, or the beasts teeth closing around the skull....no need to reveal the name of the beast, the story does that just fine. 

Thanks for sharing!",t3_a2ayti
eaxxitb,t1_eaxfvxx,Many thanks! :D,t3_a2ayti
eb0bu0e,t1_eaxfuyt,Slime and snails.....maybe puppy dog tails. ,t3_a2ayti
eaxmfpn,t1_eaxl4y2,">I'm dead. No god out of a machine. No happy ending. The remains the Minotaur leaves behind will bear no name.

Reading it back to myself, I think it is a little unnecessary. Might remove or revise it. Thanks for the constructive criticism! Definitely need outside voices to keep my writing in check.",t3_a2ayti
