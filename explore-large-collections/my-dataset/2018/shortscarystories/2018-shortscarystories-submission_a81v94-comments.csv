ec8ew9h,t3_a81v94,"I absolutely love this concept. 

At first I was going to post a comment asking why no one in the area recognizes Kira, a red-haired girl playing outside in the same town.

Then I realized the brilliance of the premise is that it would be erratic to go around town accusing other people’s kids of being a long-lost kidnap victim.

In a small town, people might gossip but would anyone actually break decorum and say something? She’s hidden in plain sight- genius.",t3_a81v94
