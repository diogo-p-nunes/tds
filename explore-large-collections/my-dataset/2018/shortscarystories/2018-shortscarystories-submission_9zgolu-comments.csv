ea9tcj1,t3_9zgolu,I think the smell from a person would be different than the smell of a turkey.  I don't know why that detail is eating at me.,t3_9zgolu
ea9eoaq,t3_9zgolu,I really didnt expect that he hid there tbh. I thought that one of the parents killed him and put him in the oven on purpose. Or used hide and seek as a cover up to kill him. You know kinda hansel and gretel like.,t3_9zgolu
eaaomm6,t3_9zgolu,"I'm sure glad we don't do thanksgiving in the UK.  Seems like it's the best time of year to 'off' a relative!! LOL!

Great story though!",t3_9zgolu
eahxdlr,t3_9zgolu,"Great story! The only thing that doesn't make sense is how can a kid be strong and capable enough to open the oven to climb into it and close it behind him, but not strong enough to push it open to climb out? Otherwise I loved it, very chilling. ",t3_9zgolu
eaau0mc,t1_ea9eoaq,I was half expecting him to not exist at all haha,t3_9zgolu
