hp4vico,t3_rjpga8,You stole this. The original was better.,t3_rjpga8
hp53q1s,t3_rjpga8,What's the original?,t3_rjpga8
hp4xoyz,t1_hp4vico,"Oof. Yep, stolen. And not even discreet about it.",t3_rjpga8
hp6miby,t1_hp4vico,"To be fair, I wasn't aware this was an actual story. One of my friends told me this story a long time ago so I thought I'd share it. My apologies, I should've checked if it a real story beforehand.",t3_rjpga8
hp5sk5z,t1_hp53q1s,"A girl is home alone and trying to sleep. She dangles her hand underneath the bed and is reassured by a familiar lick on the hand. The next morning she goes to the bathroom to brush her teeth and finds her dog’s dead corpse nailed to the wall with a message written in blood on the mirror: “HUMANS CAN LICK TOO.”

Paraphrasing from memory though",t3_rjpga8
hp4z9w2,t1_hp4xoyz,"It’s like OP read the story once and paraphrased it badly. 

The original is one of the first short scary stories that really stuck with me, I recognized it right away.",t3_rjpga8
hp70g8s,t1_hp6miby,Yeah sure,t3_rjpga8
hp5utt6,t1_hp5sk5z,Thank you.,t3_rjpga8
hp74pd0,t1_hp70g8s,Why would I lie? What do I gain if I lied? Nothing.,t3_rjpga8
hp7kafh,t1_hp74pd0,"You’re the kind of person who posted something like this claiming it as your own, so idk, you tell me?",t3_rjpga8
hp7ktds,t1_hp7kafh,When did I say I claimed it as my own?,t3_rjpga8
hp7uqdd,t1_hp7ktds,By posting it without credit. LOL,t3_rjpga8
hp8jj3r,t1_hp7uqdd,"Are you stupid? I literally said I didn't know it was a real story, so how could I of credited it if I didn't know in the first place?",t3_rjpga8
hp8kam3,t1_hp8jj3r,Asking me if I’m stupid after blatantly plagiarizing someone else’s work - hilarious,t3_rjpga8
hp8ozxe,t1_hp8kam3,"Guessing by the fact that you didn't answer my question, you realized you we're wrong, so you mock me instead. Nice. I'm getting tired of dealing with people like you on the internet, so have a good one, not-so-kind stranger.",t3_rjpga8
hp9akf3,t1_hp8ozxe,"I didn’t “answer your question” because you already gave the answer. It seemed rhetorical. You couldn’t have credited it, because you didn’t care to know who wrote it. You just posted it like it was yours. 

You plagiarized while posting to a creative writing community. That’s low, and I’m justified in calling you out on it. You chose to try and defend that, which is pretty ridiculous.",t3_rjpga8
