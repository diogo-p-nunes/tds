hn6hu53,t1_hmtujib,"Terribly sorry. That's totally on me, my mistake. I promise not to do it again. I just happen to notice the deadline of my project was nearing and had to read the shortest dialogue I could find that wraps up the whole story.

Nevertheless, other than my professor. I will not be distributing this anywhere else, you can trust me on that. I do apologize again! Do send me your email and I will send the audio there!",t3_r68syu
