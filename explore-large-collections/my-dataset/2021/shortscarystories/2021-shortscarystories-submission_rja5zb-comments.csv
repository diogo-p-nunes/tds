hp24c7b,t3_rja5zb,"Howdy friends and fans. Been a while since I posted here, huh?

Haven't really been inspired to write much horror lately, focusing on fanfiction instead. But then I discovered The Mandela Catalogue, one of my new favorite horror series. I was fascinated by the idea of Alternates, and decided to apply that theory of something familiar being warped and malevolent and apply it to places as well. Think *House of Leaves, 1408, Silent Hill, The Shining,* that sort of thing where the setting itself behaves in ways that don't make sense.

As always, if you liked this story you can find more over at r/TheHughJarchive. Until next time, peace from the heart my friends.",t3_rja5zb
