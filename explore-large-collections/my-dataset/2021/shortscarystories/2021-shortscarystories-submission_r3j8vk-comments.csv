hmatvw6,t3_r3j8vk,Mrs. Doubtfire needs to chill. Taking her kids to see the Room is a little much.,t3_r3j8vk
hmatqlq,t3_r3j8vk,Wow the scary adult version of Mrs doubtfire ðŸ˜³,t3_r3j8vk
hmbdqdw,t3_r3j8vk,"Took the kids to watch Tommy wiseau - the room.
That's it, too much horror for me.",t3_r3j8vk
hmbxyaj,t3_r3j8vk,I thought I was on a confessions page and was REALLY worried for a sec there,t3_r3j8vk
hmc29n9,t3_r3j8vk,true horror THE ROOM,t3_r3j8vk
hmbz687,t3_r3j8vk,Letting the kids watch The Room hahaha. You're tearing my sides apart.,t3_r3j8vk
hmbuwcw,t3_r3j8vk,"FYI though, despite what the movies say, a single bottle of sleeping pills isn't enough to kill yourself. Plus, you would wake up from horrible stomache cramps and probably throw up. Source: Sadly, a friend of mine tried. Luckily he failed and later told me these things.",t3_r3j8vk
hmc81d2,t3_r3j8vk,Bro The Room is decidedly NOT  a kids movie. How did you get them in without a chaperone? Or... a nanny?,t3_r3j8vk
hmauof2,t1_hmatvw6,It is a great movie though. I watched it with a few mates a few years ago and we spent our whole time laughing,t3_r3j8vk
hmaveky,t1_hmatqlq,I honestly would love to see that movie remade as a horror movie.,t3_r3j8vk
hmbz3sh,t1_hmbuwcw,"The story doesn't say they're sleeping pills specifically, just ""pills"". There's plenty of medicines that will kill you with just one bottle. Source: I was hospitalized after an OD attempt with acetaminophen (22,000mg, only about 40 pills of extra strength Tylenol), and was told I very, very likely would have died if they didn't pump my stomach.",t3_r3j8vk
hmawaza,t1_hmauof2,It is a marvel!,t3_r3j8vk
hmawn66,t1_hmaveky,I saw it the first time a few months ago and it is a depressing story.,t3_r3j8vk
hmbhbjp,t1_hmaveky,"You'll appreciate this then!

hmc6mrn,t1_hmaveky,no one could compare to Robin Williams though.,t3_r3j8vk
hmc2q6p,t1_hmbz3sh,Stay strong my lovely :),t3_r3j8vk
hmcb7ch,t1_hmbz3sh,"Oh, you're right! Sorry, my bad, I guess I just assumed. 
Also, stay strong.",t3_r3j8vk
hmc092x,t1_hmbhbjp,"Not OP, but I very much appreciated that. Thanks for sharing!",t3_r3j8vk
