They saw the little girl standing in front of the town's Christmas tree. A 30 foot, Norwegian spruce decorated with hundreds of baubles. But no one ventured to see why the kindergartner was out after dark. 

***Cabaletta Aria***

The reindeer handler, hocked up on spiked eggnog, tried to rein in his beasts as they spooked. No one saw why they turned on him. But they did see their antlers tear him apart on the outskirts of the town square. 

The Mayor, John Sycamore, proudly stood by his fireplace with his family at his annual Christmas party. The picture would haven't been used for future christmas propaganda, if his daughter, Melissa hadn't disappeared. One moment she was there, but after the flash, she was gone. It was only after extensive searching that they found her inside one of the Mayor's many snow globes adorning his mantle. 

An investor of the Mayor, one Jessica Valentine, pulled a cracker by herself at the family dinner. Many tried to understand the rambling of Miss Valentine after the pop of the snapper, but ultimately she took a knife and stabbed herself to death.  

Henry Carpenter, owner of Carpenters Carpentry, and the man responsible for raising the tree, had the sudden urge to leave his family home and trapeze half naked across town to the local bar. Henry, a teetotaller, broke behind the bar and drowned himself in spirits. The bar staff tried to stop him, but none could fight the man who held them all off with one hand until he died.

Across town, a freak snowstorm buried the home of 86 year-old Winnie Shoe under thirty feet of snow. Bizarrely, the snow was littered with aquatic life and more bizarrely still was the fact that the area surrounding Winnie's home was untouched. 

Carolers patrolling the streets surrounding the great tree fell short of their singing. One of them, a Mr Gardener, sang an unidentified tune. Witnesses were horrified when blood appeared around his mouth and leaked out of his nose. They tried to stop Mr Gardener from singing, but failed. He died soon after.

***Recitativo Secco***

The ghostly little girl remained at the tree until each and every one of them died. Then, and only then, did she turn away and face me. Her brother.

She smiled when she reconnected about  those responsible for her death. Those accountable for cutting corners constructing a new bridge.  

***Chorus***

How the mayor enticed the investor to filter money into a secret account. 

How the carpenter cut corners due to insufficient funds. 

How the steel driver didn't unload his full shipment because he was too drunk. 

How an old lady held the beneficiary over the secret accounts for half price rent. 

How a man was too scared to venture into the river after the bridge collapsed to save a drowning girl trapped in a car.  

***Finale***

They never *really* saw the girl standing in front of the Christmas tree. But she saw them."
rm37qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rm37qs/not_all_my_daughters_are_mine/,Not all my daughters are mine,4,1,1640172100.0,"There was supposed to be one.

I’d seen all the scans, talked to my wife, even chatted to the gynecologist once. All of them said she was supposed to have a baby girl.

But three cradles were left beside my wife’s hospital bed. Nothing could distinguish them, aside from the labels on the cradles.

All the doctors and nurses insisted they had delivered three babies. My wife was exhausted after the delivery, so I kept my worries to myself and let her rest.

She later decided to keep all of them. If only one was ours, what would happen to the others? She couldn’t bear to abandon a child. Besides, we wouldn’t be able to forgive ourselves if we threw out our own child.

Thus, we raised Ellie, Elaine and Emily as our own.

As they grew, Emily became moodier than the others. While the others would be chatting at the dinner table, she would be sulking in the corner. Although I was fine with her antics - I’m not the most extroverted person either - I couldn’t help but compare her to her more lively sisters. 

I remember on their twelfth birthday, Elaine seemed jitterish. She was fidgeting, biting her nails, as if anticipating something horrible. But every time I asked, she’d claim she was alright.

As we sat down at the dinner table, she gagged, choking on seemingly nothing. We gave her a cup of water, but she continued choking, only able to wheeze a faint “help”. My wife quickly ran to hold her up, pushing her fist into her stomach a few times.

I don’t know whether to be grateful that she remembered the heimlich maneuver from our first aid classes.

Elaine lurched forward, spewing onto the table. Amongst remnants of lunch and spots of blood was a creature somewhere between a fish and an insect. My wife jumped back, as the other girls screamed. Elaine - or whatever was Elaine - slumped onto the table, face down into the puke.

The creature that came out glanced up at me with huge, glassy eyes. We could only watch as it skittered away with stubby legs, leaving a trail of slime in its wake.

A lot of therapy was needed. My wife and the remaining two were shaken, but I felt especially guilty. I was the one who cared for Elaine all those years - how could I have not noticed she wasn’t human? What if she had gone and put the rest in danger?

Even so, one out of the imposters was gone.

Recently, Ellie has been equally jitterish. She jumps at small noises, and though she tried to reassure me, her shifty eyes gave everything away.

I’m certain she’s the other one. 

Tonight, I will take a knife into the girls’ room and put an end to whatever is masquerading as Ellie.

I hope I’m right. But if I’m not, I’ll take Emily and then myself.

If you’re reading this, my love, I’m sorry."

As the seasons passed with time, so did the happiness that once engulfed their home as Gabe grew up to be an insolent boy. 

Recklessness and pure malice ran in the boy's blood and the neighbors would often wonder how someone like him could come from someone as saintly as his mother. 

Breakfast in their household would consists of his taunts and mocking, each word laced with enough venom to push tears from his mother's eyes. Malevolent hands would knock down sacred miniture statues of religious figures as he'd chuckle at his mother's attempt to pray for guidance for her son.

He'd kneel beside her just to whisper ""Praying won't give you a better son coz God can't help you.""

The disrespect continued on for 13 years as Gabe walked the earth like he was invincible.
 
Everything changed though when he found his mother sitting on the dining table while reading a book which he assumed to be about god. Instead of a greeting, he placed nickels on the table and said 

""Here, since god wont help you, maybe a wishing well would and you'd wake up and have a new and better child."" 

A reply devoid of emotion from a patient woman's mouth was enough to put terror in Gabe's system as his mother said 

""Soon"" 

Broken eyes met Gabe's fearful ones as she continued by lifting the book off the table to reveal the title which said

rm139x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rm139x/a_tough_pill_to_swallow/,A tough pill to swallow.,3,0,1640163131.0,"There's a saying I'm sure you're aware of: ""You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone"". Made famous by one Joni Mitchell, in some song I can't remember the name of. It's a poignant statement, but I'm sure Joni meant for the ""it"" to refer to a partner or some valuable item. My case is a bit different. 

I can't swallow. 

I don't mean to say that I'm *incapable* of swallowing, god I would love to, but I just *can't*. 

To make a long story short, I owe money to some ""unfavorable"" characters, and I suppose it was only a matter of time before they picked me up to collect. 'Course, owing so much money meant I didn't have nearly enough on me, but I was dead weight either way. They don't like being kept waiting. 

So, they decided to kill me. Usually, it'd be a quickie to the back of the head and off I go into a ditch, but those fuckers were feeling creative. 

 Ever taken LSD? Or, really, any hallucinogen? It fucks you up good, and taking enough is either gonna drive you insane or kill you. That's their plan, but the sickos had to make a game out of it. 

They grab me, and all of a sudden I'm being driven into the desert. Probably about 2 days stuck in the trunk of a car. After a while, they throw me out into the desert, but not before taking out a bottle of the good stuff. *Lysergic acid diethylamide.* The next thing I know, they're dabbing a cloth with it and forcing my mouth open, painting the inside of my throat with the liquid. Finally, they just leave me out here. To die. 

So, now I'm stuck out in the desert. No food, no water, and I can't swallow. It's torture. I've taken to not using my mouth at all now. I can't talk, so even if I meet another person in this wasteland, I won't be able to communicate with them sans sign language. Even if I do manage to get help, I'm far enough from civilization that I'll die of thirst before I reach a hospital. Water's a death sentence now. 

I can't throw up. I'm running on food from 2 days ago. You ever try not swallowing for just a couple of minutes at a time? Your body does it automatically, so you're constantly being reminded of it when you stop. Minute after minute. Second after second. I can't even sleep. You swallow when you sleep. 

It's been a day now. The urge is overwhelming. I don't know if it's the dehydration or a couple of drops of LSD that managed to reach my stomach, but I'm starting to hallucinate. The dunes are melting. The sand is changing colors. I'm starting to lose control.

I guess I'll just swallow. I hope that when I do - *after* I do, I'll still be the same person.

I doubt it."

They trod delicately through the crop, careful not to tangle themselves on the sensitive, tripwire roots. Lyra signalled to the others, pointing her damaged arm to the largest of the canes. If any of them touched the roots it caused the curled treasure to explode, sending sugary shards of shrapnel in every direction.


Her brother, Noah, shouted back and the dolls looked behind them. A thick, multi-coloured shimmering cloud was approaching from the south.


Lyra swallowed hard when she saw the snowflake storm. Oversized and parasitical, the star-shaped seekers would smother them, converting the dolls into statuesque, living decorations; defenceless prey for migrating Yule Trees who would dangle the toy from its branches, its needles slowly drinking the doll's synthetic blood.


The toys needed to hurry but Polly, the youngest, was frightened. Dina trod delicately in order to reach her but tripped and triggered a cluster of canes. The flowers detonated, spitting shrapnel outwards with devastating energy. The two dolls were obliterated, sprinkling the field in fragments of vagina-pink plastic and striped confectionery.


Lyra ignored the tragedy and moved on. She noticed a small piece of candy had landed on her shoulder and stuffed it greedily into her mouth.


Cody was the first to reach a cane and with a vengeful zeal snapped off the top and drank from the dripping wound. He stuffed his prize into his stocking and made his way back along the train tracks to the Christmas Express. The surviving dolls soon returned with food and battened down to harbour themselves from the vindictive tempest.


Tomorrow, they would continue through the Stollen hills to Santa's factory. The toys were desperate to return.


The train tracks ran all the way to the far north and every previous territory had fed on some of her group. Most days they cleared obstacles and detritus from the route and every day they inched closer to their salvation.


For weeks they scraped away the encroaching dough. Three of them had died, pulled inwards by tortuous Curdworms. When the toys became hungry they would consume the stollen, the disgusting texture reminiscent of sickly, spongy foam.


A week later, the path was clear and the train finally thundered forward. Jinglebirds flew alongside them, tweeting choral hymns. Ahead of the dolls was a gleaming crystal-white factory, its ivory chimneys puffing out sparkling red smoke.


The Express rolled into the loading bay and the dolls disembarked. Entering the complex they staggered unseen towards the trundling conveyor belts and clambered on. This was their dream, their chance to be placed into the loving, playful hands of a child.


At the boxing section, a pair of large, warm hands picked the dolls up to inspect them.


""I thought we'd stopped delivering this brand last year because the kids hated them,"" the dolls heard Santa say as, once again, he dropped them down the 'Rejected' chute to the Yule Tree woods."

The village couldn’t help but stare

She lived within the woods alone

So little truth of her was known 

Rumors of her were pernicious

But one stood out as quite vicious

Jealousy made them blind with hate

“Her beauty was from kids she ate”

“She bathes in blood so innocent”

“We must make that sick witch repent”

Then came the clergy to her house

They corrupted her while aroused

She wept and screamed, she cursed at them

They burned her body in her den

Her dying words were for vengeance 

“You do not use your common sense!

You are not some seekers of truth

Nor do you care to find the proof

Therefore the mirror within my home

Shall show what makes you plead and moan

The hate you spread shall come alive

Will you be able to survive?”

The message was brushed off at first

But soon they saw the witch’s curse

Men would see the mirror in those woods 

Soon all left the village for good

Yet their ilk started to infect

Her curse stained bloodlines, now rejects

So if you see the witch’s mirror 

Your fate is sealed, that much is clear"

With hushed voice, King decreed the bones of the forgotten must be moved under cover of night from the charnel houses in the city to the old quarries beyond them. With a flourish of quill and by dark royal word, there were no more innocents in old Lutetia.


Only the brave and foolish answered the call of the bones. She tucked shorn hair beneath a worker’s cap, ready to dirty a rough shirt with buttons on the wrong side. Few asked questions of those with death in their eyes and battered shovels near to hand. The Francs they paid clattered into soiled palms bought the same bread as the others. Among the bones they were all alike, just as the skulls she set into the walls were all the same in death.


Across the channel, Sir Davy of the Royal Society announced the isolation of elemental calcium. Down here, the dead chuckled their indignation, bone against bone. They gave their calcium back slowly to the limestone, once chopped out of these walls to build a city that was filled with ancient horrors.


Each day took her father into the tunnels, past her ossein work. She walked under ladders and past the xylophone of tibiae to find her lonesome corner in the inky dark. Charcoal under her eyes masked the worst of the twitching fingers that wiggled in the shadows. A scare helped with the passing patches of cold that frosted her breath. There was no helping the whispered shrieks that only she seemed to hear. No hiding from the tired eyes filled with desperation that peered from crevices between the pallid tiling.


Her growling stomach kept her in these old quarries, back strained from every load they bore below on the dirge of crunching steps. Her body ached, soaked in cold sweat on her cot at night, but her mind bruised. The tap on her shoulder or tug on her trousers when no one was there. The passing shapes that melted into the walls from the corner of her eyes. She would be angry too, if these bones were hers, their sleep disturbed. She wondered if they were the only ones that were mad. Certainly they all had their secrets.


With every bone set into the walls, she felt their anguish tear at her like the whipping winter wind along the Seine. Their anguish followed her into fitful dreams, raking away her quiet. She woke weary, climbing mechanically back into the pits, buried alive and alone for the sake of the dead. When the shoring on the walls gave way, she knew even as the bones made her one of their own that she had joined them long ago."

Then after the act you will wonder what you have done to me and why you have done such a thing. All this time you thought that you knew yourself better than anyone, but then I come along and make you snap my neck for putting you in a position of desperation, anger and hatred. You will look down on my dead body and you will make excuses. 

You will feel like a coward for making excuses and you will feel dumb and useless for someone like me allowing you to get the point of snapping my neck. I will make you snap my neck one day and whether it be in 1 years time or in 10 years time, it will be your hand around my neck. You will feel so embarrassed because I managed to make you snap my neck even though I don't have any kind of powers. At the same time you will be a little amazed at how I made you snap my neck. You will see yourself differently in the mirror and conversations will all feel pointless. 

No actually forget making you snap my neck one day because I am going to make you behead me, throw me in acid and do other atrocious acts to me. You murderer, you coward, you person full of shame and guilt, and how I will one day take your good innocent name away by making you snap my neck, behead me and throw me in acid will change you forever when I make you do this to me. Go on and live your life like it is for now because when I make you murder me, you wouldn't believe it for a second and you will be a changed individual. You think you are clever because car salesman and other kinds of salesman have all but failed to make you buy things you don't need.  

I am not here to sell you something but I am here to change you and I will make you snap my neck one day and then after me, the way you will look at people will forever change. You will realize how fickle everyone's life is and how time doesn't care for anyone. I will make you do it and just you alone and you wouldn't believe it for a second when I had finally successfully, made you snap my neck. You will make excuses but the excuses don't matter as I will make you snap my neck by that point and those will be the facts. Your family and loved ones will all see you differently from that point onwards, and that will be what hurts the most."

It began one Sunday night. She was holding a blood-soaked knife, which she was running across her throat. With every slice, her body twitched until it was finally still. Blood pooled out of the wound and dyed her bedsheets crimson.
 
We were devastated of course, but soon there was more to grieve. More and more people started dying. Little Tommy put a gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger. Kyle, my best friend, suddenly ran straight in the direction of a bus, which ironed him flat. Even Mr Tumnus, the ice cream man and baker, shut himself into the freezer for 3 days and refused to come out.
 
We held as many funerals as we could, and my eyes were dry and my cheeks were red from crying. The air shook with sorrow and grief.
 
Then we saw Cassandra’s face.
 
It was carved perfectly into an oak-tree, almost overnight. It was extremely detailed, eyes, nose, cheekbones, as if carved by a Renaissance artist of long ago. 
 
But her face was as white as chalk; her eyes were wide and bloodshot. She appeared to be screaming about something. 
 
It was beautiful and terrifying to look at at the same time.
 
My parents were overjoyed. Here was their daughter, who had passed so soon, right in front of their house in a tree. My mum stared at it with longing in her eyes, before reaching out to stroke the trunk.
 
“I love you, darling,” she whispered.
 
That was when her blood froze; her arm became stiff. Her skin turned the colour of brown sludge, and hardened and roughened into bark. She must be in extreme pain, for her eyes went wide, and like her daughter, her mouth frozen open in an eternal scream.
 
Then all was quiet. It is still quiet now. This is a small town, where everyone knew each other, and where everyone *mourned* each other. Most people couldn’t take not being with their loved ones any longer. They touched the tree trunks of their own will, and froze into place, their expressions showing everything from pain to shock to relief. Even Mr Tumnus’ little daughter, who’s only three, knelt down and stroked her father’s face, the tears streaming down her cheeks hardening into wood.
 
I am the last one left. Everybody else has been frozen in time, hardened into wooden sculptures. The air is quiet and still, sorrowful and grievous. My town is a village of death.
 
I can’t take it anymore. Sometimes if I listen hard enough, I can feel them begging me to join them.
 
I think I will.
 
Goodbye."

“But you helped me so much when I was feeling out of sorts last month!” she boomed when I protested. “I have to repay you somehow!”

That’s how I ended up with a foot-high gingerbread house on my coffee table. It has to go on the coffee table because there’s nowhere else to put it. The rest of the apartment is filled with art supplies and I’m *definitely* not storing that thing under my bed. So I thought I’d just “display” it until I figured out what to do.

Now, I’m not the most . . . observant person. So I wasn’t too sure I wasn’t just imagining things when the little door on the gingerbread house was open one day.

Was it always like that? I was too busy to care.

But I *did* care when art supplies went missing. I may not pay attention to my surrounding, but I take *good care* of my tools! Oil paints are *expensive!*

I looked everywhere—in the kitchen cabinets, behind the TV, on top of the fan blades for crying out loud! But it wasn’t until I was crawling under the bed for the hundredth time that I found something else.

Crumbs.

I don’t eat in my studio. That’s how you get roaches. Ugh.

That wasn’t the last time I found crumbs, either. Vacuuming several times a day became part of my routine. And of course the source was obvious.

So I dumped the gingerbread house in the trash.

What was I supposed to do? I wasn’t gonna eat it and it was shedding everywhere! Of course I threw it out.

But that wasn’t the end of it. The next day, I woke up to a message written on my wall:

“YOULL PAY.”

It was written in red frosting.

I’d about had it. I didn’t know what was going on, but I was pretty sure I knew who did.

I marched right down to Deborah’s apartment and started banging on the door, yelling for her to come out! After about five minutes, her across-the-hall neighbor threw open the door.

“What the fuck you yelling for? Deborah’s been moved out for weeks!”

Well, I didn’t have much of a choice but to head home. When I opened the door, I was met with the worst thing yet:

My artwork, torn to shreds. And in the middle of it all, the gingerbread house, patched together with white frosting.

I screamed and tore at that damned house with my bare hands! I razed that house to its foundations. And I found something.

A little trap door.

As I watched, it shook and gave a tiny *creak!* Raised half an inch, it revealed only darkness. Then, a thin, clawed hand reached through, its skin as brown and dry as gingerbread."

It looked very much like my hometown. But as I wandered the streets, I noticed many unusual things. The roads are busy, but devoid of traffic. The sky was as clear as if I was in the countryside. The crowds of people all smiled and waved and said “hello” to one another, even me. They were all happy. The entire city seemed happy. Too happy.

Feeling that something was off, I asked a passing gentlemen why everyone seemed so unnaturally cheerful. “Because it is a nice day,” he replied. I asked him several further questions, about his job, his family, anything I could think of. He told me that he loved his family, that he didn’t need to work, that everything about his life was perfect. 

“Something is definitely wrong,” I thought. “Nobody can be this happy unless they’re hiding something!” So I asked more and more people in my dream, only to receive the same answers. “You can’t be this happy all the time!” I exclaimed. “You shouldn’t be!” “Why not?” One of them asked curiously. I tried to explain everything that was wrong with the world, all the wars, politics and economic struggles the nations were facing. But they looked as if they had no clue was I was talking about. 

Desperate now, I ran through the streets, feeing lost. Why was this world so happy? Surely it couldn’t be genuine. “It can’t be real!” I screamed. “Nobody is happy! That’s not how it works! Happiness and peace don’t exist!”

As I uttered those words, all was silent. Then that happy, peaceful, beautiful world began to fade away. I heard a great cry rise up; a wail of indescribable grief, and I found myself in a hellish dystopia not unlike the real world. I then realised as I awakened in a cold sweat, how we are all so numbed to the pains of Hell, that Heaven becomes our nightmare."

""Ma'am are you Neon Taylor?""

""Yes. Any problem?"" I asked 

""Well I'm so sorry to inform you that your son Tim had been in an accident...""

""You must have the wrong house cause my Tim is upstairs."" I almost yelled at the police.

""Your Tim was involved in an accident ma'am""One of the officers said while the other showed me a body
in a black bag. 

The person looked a lot like my boy. The same clothes and all. I was so scared because I believed Tim was home. Who came into my house? I led the police to his room. We didn't see anyone there but a note on the wall that said
 ' Please leave the house mom. He found me and he's coming for you.
Tim'"

I was sitting at my desk, staring numbly at my computer screen and dreading the day ahead of me, when I saw something the size of a fist and covered in matted wet fur scurry rapidly across my keyboard. I jumped up in shock—nearly spilling a cup of hot coffee across my lap in the process—but in the blink of an eye whatever I'd seen had seemingly vanished, and a thorough search of my office failed to uncover any sign of it. 

I brushed the peculiar incident aside and told myself that I was mistaken, that I was merely tired and overworked and hadn't actually seen anything at all. But when I was getting ready for bed that night, I caught sight of my reflection in the bathroom mirror and let out a frightened cry. Gazing back at me was a grisly, mangled visage where my face had once been; my nose was missing, deep claw marks were gouged into what remained of my bloodied skin, and my lips had been torn away to reveal bare teeth. 

The room started to spin and grow blurry. For a moment everything went dark. Eventually I opened my eyes to see that my features were restored and once again intact, though I barely recognized the ashen-faced, utterly terrified person I saw in the mirror. 

The visions continued, increasing with each passing day, until every corner I turned hosted another horror—slithering imitations of humans with glistening scales and beady red eyes, walls slick with festering coats of indeterminable meat, blood and viscera and grotesque beasts too horrifically wondrous to describe with mere words. Sleep and total darkness, when I couldn't see anything at all, were my only forms of solace.  

I didn't dare tell anyone what I was seeing. I *couldn't*. Who would've ever believed me?

I heavily considered blinding myself, but ultimately I failed to gather enough courage; despite the maddening heights my desperation and fear had both reached, I just couldn't will myself to take that final, irreversible step into sightless oblivion. By then I had stopped going to work and hid away in my secluded house, ceaselessly wondering what I had done to deserve such a nightmarish fate.

I knew it was only a matter of time before what was left of my sanity unraveled for good. I cut the electricity to my home and set to work with my hammer and nails, tightly boarding up each window until no more than a sliver of light could seep in. I sleep as much as I can, and when night falls I can't see a thing inside this dark haven. 

It's lonely here. There's no one to talk to. I've had a lot of time to sit and think. I miss my old life—everything I've lost and everything I could've had. But it hardly matters now. Something far more pressing occupies my mind. 

*I've been hearing the strangest things lately...*"

I swerve in to a ditch, and my car is stuck in the snow, so I get out and try to see if there are any cars passing by so i could get some help.

15 minutes pass and no lights, or sounds.

I grab my phone to look on the map to see where I am at, and my battery is at 3% .

I suddenly hear a person saying “Ho, Ho, Ho”.

I turn and see a large person wearing a santa suit staring into my eyes.

I jump back and said “Who are you?!” He replied “Why it’s me Santa Claus can’t you see?

He looked like his face was rotting.

I run back to my car, and he starts chasing me.

I grab my pocket knife and start to swing at him, but he grabs my arm and says i’m on the naughty list.

He proceeds to grab the knife from my hand and stab me repeatedly.

Dan didn’t remember anything from last night

Dan didn’t know why his head throbbed

Or why dried blood on his sheets was there

And bruises on his arms

Dan didn’t smell them at first either

His family

Rotting in the room beneath him

Dan only remembered the man

The man in his bathroom with the bottle

That told him to try some 

Dan sat up and didn’t remember when the dresser flipped over

Her clothes everywhere 

He didn’t remember why the mirror was smashed 

Or why nobody had cleaned up the blood under it 

It was dry

At least a week old

Dan stood up

Dan remembered the man said to take them with a drink

They’ll go down easy 

And you’ll go somewhere nobody else has

Dan saw cuts on his legs

And wondered what the man was talking about

They were big and blue

The things in the bottle

They made everything go away

But what about after that

After he took them

With the drink

Dan got out of bed

In pain

Arms bruised

Legs cut

The man was in the bathroom

Last night

Maybe the man was still there

Asleep

He took them too

At the same time as Dan

Dan found nobody in the bathroom

He found the bottle

Empty

And looked in the mirror 

Dan saw the man

The man was shirtless

His bruised gut hung over his waist

Like melting ice cream

In the summertime 

Dry blood covered his legs

His wounds looked deep

Dan remembered the sounds

How loud they were last night

How ridiculous they were last night

Dan remembered when the man took them 

Downstairs 

Together 

Dan felt his heart drop 

Into the pit of his stomach

It was the man

Not him

He would check

And they would be fine

Asleep

Like he was a moment ago

Dan went down the hallway

Down the stairs

Before he saw them

He smelled them

Rotting 

Decaying

Dan heard the flies

Dan saw his wife 

With the knife 

And before he screamed 

He remembered last night

Over a month ago

Two months 

He murdered them

The man in the bathroom did

After he took them with a drink

He took his family

With his hands

His two daughters

And his wife

The man killed them

Dan ran upstairs

Furious

Sobbing

Arms and legs throbbing

He saw the man smiling at him

The man in his bathroom with the bottle

The man said to take them with a drink

They would go down easy

And he’d go somewhere nobody else has

He’d wake up better

He would be better

Dan took them

The world turned

Swayed

Dark

Then he was out

In bed

Until

Dan woke up

But Dan didn’t remember anything from last night

Dan didn’t know why his head throbbed

Or why there was dried blood on his sheets

And bruises on his arms

The only thing he remembered

Was the man"
rlmj7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rlmj7h/the_ospreys_by_the_lake/,THE OSPREYS BY THE LAKE,37,2,1640116021.0,"  

Lake Chezzuque was a popular spot for bathing and boating during summer. The family of ospreys who nested on a tall pole overlooking the lake did not like the splashy crowds of humans, but they had become used to them, learning that they never wandered much beyond the orange buoys. Between the buoys and the shore was human territory. The ospreys kept further out.

A couple of weeks in summer, and the ospreys could mostly recognize the lake regulars. Like all good parents, the ospreys had developed a sharp sense of what was around their nest.  

And so they became aware of a human pair who kept crossing the boundary. A fully-grown male with a very young child in a small kayak. They had thick bright blue and yellow things strapped around their bodies, like most humans in boats, which kept them from drowning.

As the ospreys flew back and forth, catching fish and other snacks for their own offspring, they noticed the adult would paddle a bit further from the buoys. There was a crop of rocks about 200 meters further out from the buoys, and they lingered behind the rocks, obscured from the crowded shore. The water behind the rocks was deep with yellow-green plants growing long and tall underneath. 

One day it was cloudy, and the beach was quieter than usual. The ospreys watched the man and the child come out on Lake Chezzuque, as they had for almost every day. The man paddled behind the rocks, and made a sharp sudden movement.  

The small kayak turned over, spilling both the child and the man into the warm still lake. 

The man disappeared under, but the child's head bobbed up and down. The ospreys circled the overturned kayak and the bobbing silent child. 

The man swam through the plants. The eyes of the child grew wide with fear as the man grasped his ankle and pulled him down under the water. 

The ospreys dived down. 

Their talons gripped the straps on the child's shoulders as they tried to pull him out of the water, but the man clutched the child's ankle even more tightly, tangling it up with the plants. 

The child kicked hard. 

One of the ospreys let go of the child's strap, dived into the water and stabbed the man with her strong sharp hunting beak. 

The man released the child's ankle and began rising to the surface. 

Both ospreys gripping the child's shoulder straps could now lift him up to the surface. 

The child spluttered and gasped, the man turned and dove back down. 

He had to swim down against his life jacket, and the ospreys lifted the child further up and up. The man's arm grasped at air. 

The ospreys flew low, but high enough. The child dangled from their talons.

The humans by the shore were shouting and pointing as the ospreys flew towards them

And then there was silence as they put the child down on the beach."

She sat down at the small desk covered with paper, some in piles, some on their own.  The manuscript sat in the center.  She used to look forward to reading his chapters as he worked through them, but the work and the energy required was beginning to wear thin.  Especially for this one.  She enjoyed his earlier works, heavy on science fiction, aliens, space travel, with mystery and romantic subplots.  Overall light on violence, often casting natural disasters or space phenomenon as the main antagonist. They were hardly groundbreaking literary works, but they were published and paid the bills and for a comfortable life they enjoyed together

This manuscript was different and it made her uncomfortable to read.  The tone was heavier, the characters smaller, the genre still was not obvious to her.  Sixty pages in and she could not yet tell who the protagonist was going to be.  The character Crawford seemed like the obvious choice due to how much time he was given, but he was too unsympathetic.  He was cold and dismissive and nearly cruel to his co-workers.  One coworker, Samantha, seemed like an option as a reluctant hero.  She had a sort of Sarah Conner appeal, where she was vulnerable now, but may grow into someone formidable over time.

That’s what she had hoped for when she began the third chapter, freshly printed on the desk.  He always placed a pencil for her to make notes right on the page and even sometimes listened to those suggestions.  

The climax of this installment was grotesque.  Crawford's empty cruelty towards Samantha was horrific and unlike anything she had ever seen written by her husband.  The deliberate and systematic stalking, capturing, and dismembering of the would-be heroine left her shocked and sick to her stomach.  What had he written, who was this, where did such graphic details come from?  Without Samantha, what was even the point of this book then?  The glee and excitement narrated by Crawford was so emphatic, almost childlike wonder.  This would all be normal from certain horror authors, but not from him, not from her husband, it couldn’t be.

She allowed her face to fall forward into her hands.  Her elbows resting on the silent desk and she took some deep breaths.  This wasn’t him.  Ten years she had been proof reading his work and never once was there a scene or a character like Crawford.  Through her mind’s eye she could see his happiness as Samantha’s entrails fell through his fingers.  It was written to feel so real, too real.

She sat up and rotated in her desk chair to face the door frame.  His eyes shone out under long bangs.  Not his eyes, someone else’s eyes.  They shone with not happiness, not with delight, but with unabashed glee, his glee.  Not her husband’s glee, *his* glee.  He stepped lightly into the room. The door clicked softly as it closed, trapping the three inside."

We live on the bayou, deep and away from just about everybody. I’d been sitting out on our pier conversating with my new friend Josh. He was an odd fella—didn’t seem very sure of himself. I tried to put him at ease.

“I like this time of the night,” I said. “Everything seems all calm and peaceful like.”

He didn’t say nothing.

“But that’s the thing about the bayou—you just never know what might be a lurking in the shadows.”

He made some little sound—couldn’t tell if he was trying to keep from laughing or crying.

“That wife of mine—she’s a looker,” I said. “Wouldn’t you agree?”

He gave his head a little nod, then said, “Yeah, she’s a looker.”

“Tell me again how y’all met?”

He sort of rolled his eyes, which I thought was rude.

“I’m serious. Tell me again how you and Jackie met.”

“It was at our company Christmas party. She worked in the office and I worked in the field. We’d never had occasion to meet before then.”

“That’s just confounding, ain’t it? I mean, you both work for the same company for years and never meet, and then by chance y’all just happen to wind up at the same punch bowl. Crazy stuff.”

“Yeah . . . it’s crazy.”

“Just a chance meeting, and next thing you know you and me are out here having a conversation.”

“Yeah.”

“Sort of like winning the lottery.”

There was a sound—a disturbance in the water across the way—and it got his attention. He started trying to reach his leg up on the pier.

“You don’t want to do that,” I said. “Soon as you get your foot up here, I’m gonna blast a hole in your leg.” I raised the shotgun from my lap to show him I meant it.

“Please, mister, you gotta let me outta here!”

“I don’t think so.”

“At least loosen these ropes. I can’t hardly feel my hands!”

“I wouldn’t worry about it.”

“Well—what about Jackie? Shouldn’t you go check on her?”

“I left her plenty of slack in the rope. She’ll be fine—as long as she doesn’t lose her balance and fall off that chair.”

“This ain’t right,” he said, sounding like he was a bit upset. “What you’re doing—it just ain’t right.”

“I’ll tell you what ain’t right,” I said, then I looked him dead in the eye. “It ain’t right to bed another man’s wife—in that other man’s bed. ‘Round these parts, that’s what ain’t right.”

“*I didn’t know*,” he whined. “I didn’t know she was married.”

“I guess you didn’t see that ring on her finger. Hell, it’s still on there now.”

I dumped my bucket of bloody chicken quarters in the water next to him. He startled, sort of yelped.

“That chicken won’t hurt you—if that’s what you’re thinking,” I said. “But I do feed the gators pretty regular. I expect they’ll be sniffing around shortly.”"

On my deathbed, more vows were made. I promised I’d always watch over you. And I begged you to never forget me. I passed away shortly after that day.

But now I just wander about the halls of a home that used to be ours, quiet and unnoticed, like a gentle winter wind. I've watched over you everyday since my passing. I tried to make my presence known, but you never seemed to notice.

When you spent hours crying over me, I tried to hold you one last time. But you'd always shrug me off, as if I was some draft entering the room. 

I used to wait until you left our room, and I'd change the channel of our TV to shows we used to love. I tried to make it obvious. A romcom I forced you to watch, that cheesy sitcom that we put on when there was nothing interesting showing, and we ended up getting really invested in. but you'd always just sit down and change it right back.

I started using desperate means to get your attention. One day, I went through the kitchen like a hurricane, opening every cabinet door, every drawer. But you just walked right through, completely obvious. Careless and unbothered, almost like you died with me that night.

I was even watching over you when you started to heal. The curtains in our home, once closed, were now opened. The first time light has been let into our home in some time.

That was around the same time you finally took the ring off. Around the same time you let *her* into our house. I watched you invite that *woman* into *our* bed. Calling her a pet name you *only* called me.

And I got angry.

Very angry.

And I made my presence known that day.

You would’ve thought it was the dead middle of December, a chill entering the room frigid enough to freeze hell over.

Suddenly the wind, gentle before, now violent. A tornado wrecking havoc to anything in its path. The sounds of screams mix in with the smashing of pictures frames falling off the wall. 

I was at my breaking point.

I couldn’t control it.

Glass was flying, cutting down anything that gets in its way. You happened to be caught in the crossfire. As shards dug into your body, you ran out of the house. And you took that woman with you.

You started sleeping at her place. You were Practically moved in the next week.

And now I haunt a house no one lives in.

I know you’ll start the family I always wanted with this woman. And as the years go on, moss will cover the tombstone you never visit. Making my name unreadable.

Eventually, I’ll be completely and undoubtedly, forgotten."
rlhhzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rlhhzu/have_you_ever_heard_of_forest_elfs/,Have you ever heard of Forest Elfs?,9,0,1640101907.0,"Dead bodies of miners were found in Canadian forest near mines, or at least what was left of them. Some people claim that they went crazy and killed each other.

They lived in a cottage, not too far from those mines. It is said that during the night you can hear strange sounds, reminiscent of children's mischievous laughter. Those miners worked there for two months and went to town once to twice a week. Apparently, they released some gas from the mine, inhaled it and attacked each other.

The only survivor insists it was elves. But people don't believe him and say he only had hallucinations caused by the gas. But a few things didn't fit that story. Some of those miners' bodies were partly eaten, and the bites do not resemble any known animal. Many small fangs and their flesh did not appear to be torn like an animal would do, it was more like human eating.

So, the whole version is that the miners attacked each other because of the gas they released, and until they were discovered, an unknown species of animal found and enjoyed their bodies. The only problem with this theory is that their tools were not found, and their supplies also disappeared.

So far, the people living near that forest have claimed to see very strange creatures. Well, some say it's just feeding the fable. Sometimes it happens that someone disappears in that forest, but they attribute it to wandering for it is a very deep forest.

Anyway, the next time you see a small, strange creature just standing on two feet in the distance, in any forest, don't start running the opposite way because that’s exactly what they want. To scare you from being careful and right behind the nearest tree they stab a pickaxe to your legs and the last thing you'll see will be a herd of forest Elfs approaching you and the last thing you will feel will be their small fangs devouring you.

We had both come from religious families who had repeatedly shoved it down our throats. We had both left the religion as soon as we both turned 18.

Both of our parents both demanded that we have a church wedding otherwise they wouldn't come. I can still remember the shocked Pikachu faces they had when we told them that we would miss having them there. They eventually relented as they didn't want to lose a chance of being grandparents.

We were recently invited to a joint family reunion to celebrate my parents 25 year wedding anniversary. We arrived early to help out with everything. A few of my family members kept dropping hints that they think we should start going to church more often, but I pretended like I didn't hear them. 

The party was going into full swing and everyone was enjoying themselves when a call of nature occurred. I quickly excused myself and headed to the nearest bathroom. 

I was just drying my hands when I heard my wife begin to scream. I ran out the door and froze at the spectacle unfolding. All of our family members were glowing with a bright yellow light. The light slowly engulfed them and they began to rise upwards.

I walked over to my wife and squeezed her hand as we watched the rapture happen around us. I began to regret my decision to become an atheist as I saw thousands of glowing orbs heading towards heaven.

I let out a yelp as my wife suddenly squeezed my hand in a vice like grip. I looked over at her in confusion and noticed she was clawing at her throat with her other hand. 

I nearly let out a scream as a tiny hand suddenly popped out of her mouth. It was quickly followed by a body. I watched in awe as our unborn son crawled out of her throat and gazed around. His eyes locked on mine for a few seconds and he seemed to smile at me, but that could have just been my imagination. He then raised his hand and gave me the finger.

His body began to glow and he rose up to join the others. It took me a few moments to gather my wits and gaze down at my wife. Her lifeless body lay on the ground with blood pouring out of her throat. I stood there for a few more seconds until all of the glowing orbs disappeared from sight."

rldn3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rldn3c/the_tick/,The Tick,13,0,1640089686.0,"  A simple walk in the woods. That’s how it all started. Just me, my dog and my girlfriend. And it was barely the woods, even… The path we walked on was grazed by many tourists before us. We had people walking in front of us and behind us the entire time. It felt more like an amusement park than nature at one point. But it was great, it was lovely, it’s what we needed after a long year of working overtime and trying to deal with a pandemic.  
   
 

After a good two hours of walking we got back to the car and drove back to our little cabin, the one we rented for a week. My girlfriend was on her way to the fridge. ‘A beer?’ she asked.  
 ‘How about a coke?’  
 ‘There’s only one left and I’m taking that,’ she said with a sly smile while cracking open the can.  
 ‘Ah where’s communism when you need it?’ I replied.  
 She rolled her eyes and took off. It wasn’t long before I heard the tub starting to run.  
 

I sat down on the couch, still wearing my dirty clothes, and I was far from comfortable. The shirt was alright still, I thought it was clean enough after a smell check in the armpit region. The pants had to go. Hard soil and wet mud formed a weird mush on the bottom. I took them off, and threw them in the corner of the room. I could have cleaned them up, but my legs were tired and it’s not like the cabin was super clean at this point anyway. I could not be bothered and that was the first time I saw it. Around my ankle, where the mud was, I spotted something black. A dark spot that was moving in the corner of my eye. When I focused on the spot and rubbed of some mud to see what was going on, it seemed nothing was. The mud came right off and the only thing that was there was my leg. The skin was a bit grey from the dirt, but there was no dark spot there.  
 

I thought nothing of it. It went out of my mind as fast as it happened. And why wouldn’t it? I mean, doesn’t everyone see things every now and then? A dark shape moving in a garden that turns out to just be a tree. A movement behind you when you are walking up the stairs in your house when you are home alone? Maybe that awkward feeling when you close your eyes when you are washing your hair in the shower? The feeling that someone will be right there when you open your eyes. But that never happens, so you don’t think twice about it. The tick sucked me dry over the next few weeks, and because it always moved around I never even had a chance to see the thing. It grew while I lost my mind."

You just don’t know any better. I became an expert at braiding my hair without looking, and brushing my teeth without being able to check if I had toothpaste around my mouth. 

It was a bit odd, with hindsight, that we had a special cloth to cover the TV screen as soon as we turned it off for the night, and I always understood that cars were only for daytime use. My Dad just didn’t like driving in the dark, was all. 

I knew what I looked like of course; there were mirrors at school. Not that I often looked, I think you just get used to living life without the vanity of staring at yourself. Sometimes I’d catch sight of myself walking past a shop window, next to my Mom, and do a little skip as I walked, just to see what I looked like to others. Only in the daytime though, the shops round here don’t open late. 

It came as a surprise to me then, when I found the tiny, sharp sliver of mirrored glass tucked behind the cereal in the top kitchen cupboard. I was only eight or nine years old, but even then I knew that it must have been hidden for a reason. Every so often, I would slide a chair into the kitchen, and silently open the door, sliding a hand between the packets to check it was still there.

The day it disappeared was the day my Dad didn’t come home. The Police said he had probably gone to stay with his family back in Romania, but I never believed them. Mum and I cried for ages. I remember resting my head on her shoulder as she sobbed, and somehow feeling responsible. I knew the two things had to be connected, and planned to find  out what had happened to the tiny sliver of silver.

I never expected it to appear under my pillow that night. As my fingers closed around the sharp edge as I drifted off to sleep, blood began to seep into my pillow. I wasn’t worried; I knew exactly how to get rid of the stain, after all, I’d watched my Mom scrub the carpet with salt water after I’d bled all over the floor last time. 

The mirror wasn’t as sharp against my hand as it had been in my neck. I just wished I could tell my Mum that it would be ok, that I forgave her. I just wished she’d look into a mirror, so I could show her that I was still with her, and always would be."

Aunt Darlene had been such a positive existence, her goodness nourished our family and extended selflessly towards others. That's why when she took her final sleep, many strangers came to the hospital to say goodnight.

Academically speaking, aunt Darlene was never good in that lane that's why she barely finished highschool. She would support herself by doing tasks such as babysitting, lawn mowing, serving food and other tasks that didn't ask too much of her brain power. 

She once told me ""I know I won't ever be smart but I can always be good."" 

Those words were uttered with such sad eyes that all I could do was hug her, praying that she would understand just how enough she already was. 

In the midst of sorrow and aching hearts, mom still found the courage to sort through my aunt's last wishes. She left a note with what little cash she had left for me and made me the guardian of the stray cat she took in. I broke down after reading it for how could love echo so loudly without an ounce of sound? 

I vowed to save the money for Poppy the cat as the gentle thing slept on my stomach. Her gentle nature reminded me too much of my aunt that it got me wondering if fate planned their meeting. 

Aunt Darlene's last act of kindess came through an instruction that her body be donated to a science company with a reasoning that stated ""I still want to be useful even in death"". 

As much as we wanted to have somewhere to visit her, our family respected my aunt's decision, how could you deny something from someone that barely asked for anything?

Two weeks passed before a representative of said company explained that after the study, aunt Darlene's body would be returned to us in a cremated manner along with papers explaining what actions had been done. I had been too numb to hear what else that person said, I just wanted my aunt back. 

Sleepless nights and dark mornings came and went and after a month, we got a letter...a letter that catapulted us into hell. 

The pristine envelope held a crisp white paper with the company's logo at the upper right corner. Eyes of different generations scanned the note and the message it sent was

""We ate her"""

NASA has confirmed the red nosed comet dubbed T-25 will enter Earth's atmosphere, coming the closest it has ever been since it's discovery in 336 AD. This year proves most coincidental, as it's the 25th sighting since its first appearance. 

Astronomer, Giles Redfern said;

*It's the strangest comet to ever have been studied. Most comets take a path that is only viable to certain parts of the world. This one is particularly interesting as it slingshots around Earth a few times before leaving orbit. This gives everyone, the world over, a chance to see this magnificent chariot.*

Astronomers state that the comet, once named by the Vikings as Glær, due to the visible tail looking like a chain of horses, will cause the sea to rise twelve points and upset the Earth's tectonic plates making them shift due to the magnetic friction caused by its passing. 

Last year, over the skies of the Dardanelles Strait, a fractured piece of the comet crashed into the neighbouring sea, boiling aquatic life. Many woke that morning to beaches awashed with fish. Studies on the piece of the comet had to be cancelled due to many of the researchers contracting a mysterious illness. 

Michael Killarney, Pastor of the Church of Our Lady Grace, said;

*There will be no change to our Midnight Mass Service. If anything, the presence of this heavenly visitor is a sign that the Lord is looking down on his children, blessing our celebration of Jesus Christ.*

Astrophysicist Hamish Cordel stated that this comet will cause a loud series of popping as it breaches the Exosphere and travels through the thermosphere, much like a truck starting up, or the hooting of an owl. Hamish also warns that although T-25 is believed to breach the Mesosphere and some satellite communication might be destroyed in its passing, it might break into the stratosphere. 

Doomsdayers are heralding the comet as the arrival of the infamous Nibiru, the red planet. Although skeptics will say that the earlier prophecies didn't amount to anything, Many, like myself, have bunkered down this Christmas. 

When the booming sounds of the comet come Ho Ho Hoing across the world, we know that the children won't wake to presents under their trees. When the air eventually stops burning, and the skies fall with the whiteness of ash, there will be no one left on the surface to celebrate Christmas thanks to NASA T-25."

He, then, coaxed twin born scorpions to lead him to the conjunction of shadow and light, the place dead come to take flight to the subterranean.

One time Aghad's grandfather, a doctor of divining art, told him that he could forever evade death by leaving his footprints on the sands of the dead. For, the Lord of the Underworld, having seen his trace, will assume that he had duly passed and will not come looking for him.

Down went Aghad along the plunging trail, down and down, to where all days and nights drown, where no mouth breathes, tongues cannot speak, airs neither rise nor fall, dreamers do not not the dreams seek.

Upon landing on the kingdom of ash he began traversing north and south, walking the path paved in rocks and bone, through the woods of remorse where leaves bore sighs, to the mount of longing where many jump to their deathless deaths. He saw thirsty ghosts suckling through wall membranes dew of eternal mist, witnessed tragic reunions of past lovers who no longer each other knew, and stood in a cave where wine offerings from above dripped down. It was hot everywhere but it was also cold. He held no fear, but of fear he was aware. He was not sorrowful but much sorrow he did behold.

His travel done, Agahd neared the river that marks the cordon for the abyss. There awaited the Bridge Maiden who kept guard against devious defectors.


""Madam, by a strange error I was taken

To this realm where I'm now forsaken,

For here the ghosts of naked apes tread

Whereas the life of a feline before I led.""


The maiden studied Aghad's face, curious and suspicious.


""Indeed, eyes of the beast you do bear

That are not for this sequestered lair.

You may, thus cross this river to revival,

Return to the realm of matters elemental.

But, you, as all who thus depart this plain,

Must carry a message to the upper domain.""


""What is it?"", asked Aghad. The maiden whispered into his ear but so softly that he did not properly hear. Paying no mind, he began crossing the bridge, to the bank of the sunlit side. But, with each step the murmur of the Bridge Maiden grew louder:

""I shall never tell

What lays in the well""

Further he went, it swelled and bellowed, echoing upon echos, till thunderous roars filled the cavern of his skull. Just as he reached the end of the bridge the noise in his head became an explosion piercing through every channel of his body. Light, at last, fell on Aghad as he, in an instant, vanished into a whirl of vapour."

When the heavens tore themselves open, the beings which revealed themselves didn't neatly fit into our concepts of either gods or aliens. All we know is that the skies around the world were filled with shimmering lights as we heard, and by which I mean *every human* heard, an announcement.

""Humankind, we have designs for your planet but find that we have no use for you. Your destruction begins in one week.""

In the chaotic week that followed the beings would occasionally say other things, apparently in response to negotiations made by our side. As humanity's side of the conversation has now been lost to history I don't know what prompted the following statement, but it may have been our greatest mistake:

""Then your deaths shall be caused by self-reflection.""

---

The week passed and we didn't all instantly die so some people, optimistically and foolishly, assumed that the beings had overestimated their own abilities. How wrong they were.

We have no way of knowing who the first case was but we do now know two factors. One is that it seemed to affect people who were generally focussed on themselves for any reason - whether narcissistic or mindful. The second is that the initiating event in this early stage was almost always a mirror.

When an affected individual caught sight of themselves they would suddenly be flooded with every feeling that they had provoked over their entire lifetime. All of them, all at once and with no tapering off. A dictator smashed his head open with a rock. A philanthropist was so overwhelmingly happy that they lacked the focus to eat. No age, sex or race was immune and screaming, giggling and sobbing filled our cities.

Simply avoiding mirrors wasn't enough, we quickly learned. Even humans who tore their own eyes out were affected when they eventually thought about themselves.

After a month, the cities were nearly silent. Yet I remained.

I don't know when the beings will notice me and finally delete me. I don't even know whether or not there are others like me left. All I know is that I mattered so little to anyone that neither their pain nor their pleasure can kill me.

And that, perhaps, is a fate worse than death."

Everything green seemed to thrive in the woods behind the abandoned barn, trees loomed above while ferns and wildflowers sprouted lush and full, leaving only one spot of bare earth. Suzie had picked the perfect spot to grow flowers, she just knew it, but somehow anything she planted in her chosen little patch near the biggest tree just would not grow. If she planted seeds they wouldn’t grow, when she tried fully grown flowers, the beautiful pedals and leaves turned black and wilted, leaving her with dead flowers. When she asked her first-grade teacher, Mrs. Wallace had told her that piece of the ground might not have many of the nutrients plants need to grow. Mrs. Wallace had also told her, like all problems it had a solution, she told her about how Native peoples taught the early Settlers to bury a fish with their crops to help fertilize the soil.

Suzie waited for the perfect day to try planting flowers again. That day was the sunny day after a good rainstorm had soaked the ground. During lunch, she made sure not to eat the cold meat in her sandwich and tucked it away in her lunch box. Racing out of class after the final bell, she pulled along her red wagon which carried a small shovel and heavy clay pot, only stopping when she arrived at a patch of beautiful light purple pansies growing in a field a few blocks from the schoolyard. After placing the flowers and some soil in the pot, she headed for her chosen spot behind the old barn.

On the way, she met up with a girl in her class named Clare, a shy girl with whom she sometimes skipped rope at recess. She told Clare she was sure the pansies would grow in her chosen spot if she mixed lunch meat into the soil before she planted them over top, and asked Clare to help her. Happy to be asked, Clare joined her as they walked into the woods.

Once they arrived, they started digging and didn’t stop until the hole they were in was waist-high. Then spread pieces of Suzie’s torn-up lunch meat around the bottom. Suzie climbed up out of the hole, but when as looked down at it and the tiny bits of her lunch, she knew it would never be enough nutrients for her flowers. She asked Clare to pack down the soil at the bottom of the hole to make it level while she got the flowers. With Clare focused on stomping down the dirt, Suzie managed to lift the clay pot high above her and crash it down onto Clare. The pot split Clare’s head open, and she collapsed in the hole and lay still as blood pooled around her. Suzie started shoveling the dirt they had dug out back into the hole, certain she could now grow any kind of beautiful flowers in her spot."

A dream being pounded to the ground as it's final words were, 'Please believe in me, please listen to me.'; As this dream dies, I slowly fall into the dark void of saddness. I wished for a heaven, the kind of heaven where man can cherish each other and the joyful smiles of children. I hear the peace fade, the joy of people crumbling; these sounds echoing through my mind methodically, like a broken song reaching for a beautiful tone. It took an infinity for all to stop. Finally, the explostion of pain had settled, but the radiation it left behind fell and poisoned the words of the men and women that so desperately tried saving what was salvageable. The symphony of silence sang through the ruins of the destroyed world. The heavenly silence broke as I cry. I cry and I cried. Oh how we foolishly dreamt of heaven. For we fantasized a fantasy that could have came true. What fools we are and what fools we were. If only; if only."

Noah continued: ""Then she was like: 'no, no, no, I'll get a bandage, we'll get you cleaned up'. Like she realized where this would be going. I got tested anyway, just in case.""

""The dog is in quarantine now. Tomorrow, it will bite one of the handlers, and that will be that.""

It made me smile. My apartment complex is pretty friendly and I regularly hung out with the people on my floor. I tucked the little gift into my purse, figuring I’d open it at work.

When I got to work, I found another present on my desk, this one in green. Again, the tag read, “From Your Secret Santa.”

That was a little strange. I didn’t work with any of my neighbors and none of my coworkers knew where I lived. But then again, it could just be a coincidence.

I decided to open both boxes, telling myself I was being silly. The first box held a ticket to a showing of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” my favorite Christmas movie. That was actually pretty sweet.

The second box held a miniature bottle of white zinfandel, my favorite wine. Okay. Still nice. But I didn’t remember mentioning my wine preferences to anyone at work.

I tried to put it out of my mind, but it was difficult with the boxes sitting on my desk. I ended up stuffing them in a drawer until the end of the day.

I was exhausted when I finally got to my car and ready to get home. I was so preoccupied with thoughts of dinner and Netflix that I almost sat on the little white box in the driver’s seat.

How did it get there? I was sure I’d locked my car. Fear flickering through me, I snatched up the box, slid into my car, and locked the doors. I barely glanced at the “From Your Secret Santa” tag before ripping the box open.

Inside was a golden ring. Picking it up, I realized it was set with an opal and two little diamonds, just like my grandmother’s ring. But that was locked away in a safety deposit box. How could it have possibly gotten here?!

When I got home, a small gold box waited on my doorstep.

I didn’t touch it. Instead, I fumbled with my keys, panicking as I tried to unlock the door.

Was this person watching me? Following me? It was the only thing that made sense.

As soon as I was inside, I locked the deadbolt and dug my phone out of my purse. I needed the police.

I dialed 911 and put the phone to my ear, heart hammering. The dial tone was still ringing when I felt hot breath on my neck.

“What’s wrong?” an unfamiliar voice said in my ear. “You didn’t open your present.”"

In the 40 years we spent together I can’t recall a single week he didn't either jump out from behind a door or stash a toy spider in the laundry. Once, he even snuck up behind me and put the front of his slipper on the scale while I weighed myself.

I don’t mind telling you his shenanigans drove me round the twist. And after each prank, I’d furiously slap his arm again and again while he giggled like a schoolgirl and struggled to breath.

So imagine my surprise when, after he passed, his juvenile pranks were the thing I missed most. Oh sure, my family and friends tried to cheer me up; some even pulled a few practical jokes of their own. But the fact is when Harold died, he took the laughter with him. In those first six months, I never even cracked a smile.

Fortunately, you can’t keep a good prankster down. And Harold was a *very* good prankster.

It started with the kitchen taps turning themselves on in the middle of the night. Then my handbag traveled around the house, seemingly by itself. When I found it inside the grandfather clock one morning, I just knew Harold was responsible. I can’t tell you how many times he stashed my personal belongings in there.

Oh sure, there were raised eyebrows from loved ones—I imagine my claims Harold had reached out sounded like a coping mechanism, or perhaps an early sign of dementia—but that hardly mattered. Joy was finally back in my life.

The other thing you should know about Harold was that he was *very* protective of me. For our third date, we went to the beach, and he knocked out some punk who offered to lotion my back. Even in our twilight years if anyone dared disrespect me, he would throw down without a moment hesitation.

Now, not to boast, but I don’t mind telling you that, before Harold, plenty of gentlemen had their eye on me. In my mid-sixties, I’m still something of a knockout. And after my husband passed, many saw it as…an opportunity.

Most of them turn up at my door, insisting they be allowed in to properly offer their sympathies, and I’d sit them down in the lounge while I make a fresh pot of tea. Then, before the water can even boil, the walls would rattle as twisted screams fill the house.

Back in the lounge, there’d be entrails spread across the walls and blood splattered up the curtains. Sometimes finding my suitor's head would take an entire day—the first time Harold stashed it in the clock, but since then it’s popped up in a series of more elaborate hiding spots.

I’m not ready for another relationship. It is, after all, far too soon. But I still enjoy inviting my suitors in, so that Harold can continue pulling his adorable little pranks."

His appearance always changed. One day or minute he could be a dragon, the next a teddy bear with pink hair and red eyes. But then it happened.

""Crap."" I exclaimed. I was opening an envelope from the mailbox on the way into my house, and I had somehow gotten a paper cut. Our family had always been upheld the standards of a neat and tidy house, so I knew if I dropped blood on the tile or carpet Mom would kill me. I sprinted up the stairs and ran into the bathroom, panting. I reached up to open the mirror cabinet, and cursed when there weren't any band aids.

""What are you gazing at, boy?""

Was I crazy, or was his face always changing? He had no real appearance, other than a crisp black suit and four arms. His face was constantly changing. But then I realized he was holding a butcher knife. He pushed me onto my bed, brandishing the weapon.

This time of year in particular was the hardest. Christmas. Outside, the world was blanketed in white, the dark days illuminated with fairy lights trailing from house to house.

Sometimes he ventured outside into the vicious cold and became another invisible old burden. Shuffling through the shops he purchased items his family had enjoyed when they were still alive. After Eights, Quality Street, the Radio and TV Times.

He tried to watch the shows he had enjoyed as a child; a wearisome attempt to ignite the youthful joy inside. They had not aged well and looked pathetic.

Arthur often pushed reality aside to make existing tolerable.

He tried to make conversation with shop staff but he could tell they were uninterested.

Neither had he received a single Christmas card despite sending plenty. People complained they were always too busy and would signal they were donating to a charity instead. That was an admission of apathy, of laziness and it angered him.

Every night he stared out of his sash window at the families making their way home through the snow. He castigated himself for wasting all his years but never wept over it. His father always told him that only girls cry. Even at the funeral he kept his tears hidden.

Every day was more turgid than the last until Christmas Day came upon him. He often slept on the sofa now, hating the isolation his bedroom represented. A family home without a family was just a box of miseries.

Arthur dreamed of when he was young, his parents sitting beside him, encouraging him to open the presents that Santa had brought him. The Christmas dinners, the laughter at the TV comedy specials and the smell of the pines all felt so real.

When he awoke he cried for the first time in over seventy years. He was so unhappy, so miserable, so alone, so ashamed.

There was a knock at the door and it startled him. He made his way to open it while wiping his wrinkled face.

Facing him was a child-sized doll. It reminded Arthur of himself when he was eight years old.

His immediate impulse was to shut the door but the doll held out its hand.

""Can I come in out of the cold?"" It asked.

Arthur took hold of the tiny plastic hand and led it into the living room. The old man was astonished to find a large pile of presents underneath his tree.

Together, they unwrapped them. Toys from his younger days, pristine and untouched. For the first time in years he was having fun. They played all day long.

Eventually, they became tired and went upstairs. Holding hands they both gently, finally went to sleep.

Eighteen months later, Arthur's decomposed body was discovered. Handcuffed to him were the rotting remains of a child who had been reported missing around the same time."

At one point you did know who your uncle was. For seemingly his entire life he had been suffering from a neurodegenerative disease, yet still pushed the boundaries of biomedical engineering as your parents would constantly laud. However, this idea of uncle Allen was torn away ever since your last family gathering some odd 15 years ago. 

Veiled in secrecy, you were never to be told what was found in the garage that thanksgiving night which fractured the family. Uncle Allen’s acclamation slowly faded from your bedtime stories, and any reference to the other half of your family drew a heavy air of silence into the room that lingered for minutes on end.

But now it’s time to find the truth. Now it’s time for you to ring the-

A sudden, disquieting buzzer goes off and the front door mechanically whirrs open.

After a brief pause, you step inside and peer through the musty hallway plumed with dust. It had bedrooms on either side and a large living room at the end, cluttered with graphite-peppered papers and cheap laptops that lay strewn across the counters.

You take a few weary steps down the hallway, when from the corner of the living room you see an uncanny, bunraku-like machine coast past. It was adorned with a makeup-laden plastic exoskeleton, meant to resemble skin. Its chest was a rigid wooden frame, with bulging copper mechanisms in the center and a single loathsome plastic artery protruding from them.

It pumped a dark viscous fluid towards its partially-exposed flesh that jutted out of the seams between the plastic plates, coursing and beating with each pump towards the one arm with which it had to operate.

It was ergonomically boxed, and horrifyingly simple in its design.

Trying to ignore it, you continued looking for the whereabouts of your uncle as the robot went on with its tasks; but you couldn’t find your uncle anywhere, nor ignore it anymore.

You padded towards the robot, licking your lips to speak - when a shrill, computerized voice came on:

*“Though life has taken Uncle Allen from us, what remains is his ambitions. I am only a piece of the apparatus. Don’t remember this…* ***thing****; for I am no longer… “*

Though his sound was unrecognizable, his voice was. Your blood froze then shattered, your mind leapt then dove, and your legs kicked off the ground before you told them to.

Sprinting across the hall and breaching through the door, your footsteps quickened as the echoes of your sneakers on the concrete drowned throughout the damp, foggy, orange-lit streets.

I was bullied, beat up or straight up invisible. And forget about any girls looking my way, any attempt at dating was greeted a not so subtle “eww” or a they didn’t even know I existed. This year was going to be different, I just knew it…but still, the insecurities of last year ran through my mind.

It must have been all over my face because my dad looked over at me in the passenger seat and read me like a book.

“Don’t sweat it kid.” He assured me, placing his right hand on my shoulder, left hand still on the wheel as we inched forward in the drop off lane. “You’ve been working on this all summer, you’re going to do great.”

“Thanks dad. Wouldn’t have had the confidence to even come back here if it wasn’t for you.” It was true. My dad was my best friend and biggest influence. Last year things looked grim but this summer, we worked hard to make sure I was going to fit in and be noticed. Being a former marine, he knew exactly how to get my body in shape so maybe some girls would finally notice me. He helped style my outfit for the first day as well. To me, it screamed a little too ‘new year, new me’ and a bit try hard, but pops was the expert and I was willing to try anything.

“Got it. You know your way around campus right? You have your schedule, you know where to go?”

“Yes, dad.” I was noticeably uncomfortable with my new outfit, it didn’t seem me. My dad noticed my discomfort.

“Great. Also, love the black on black and….I have a feeling Crystal Hannigan will as well. Do you have any classes with her this year?”

“Yeah, homeroom.” I said blushing. Guess I was obvious about my class crush.

“Well you make sure she gets a good look at you son.” He said as we approached the drop off spot. He opened the trunk as I got out. “Good luck today bud. I’m proud of you no matter how today goes.”

“Thanks dad.”

I needed those reassuring words today. I watched my dad drive away with my bag slung around my shoulder. I looked at the school and took a deep breath. I pulled the AR-15 dad got me out of the bag along with the pipe bombs and entered the building. This year, they were going to notice me, like it or not."

As I crept downstairs, I heard a cat wailing as its claws dug into the doorframe, gouging deep channels into the wood.  

The yowling only grew louder as I entered the kitchen, turning on the lights. As I approached the door, I heard the faint recognizable tink of a bell around the cat’s neck. 

“Patches? Is that you?” I called out. The scratching stopped at the sound of my voice. On the other side of the door, his little bell tinkled as he purred.

I sighed, leaning my head against the door.

“I’m sorry pal, I can’t let you in. You know that.”

A loud hiss rattled the door as the scratching picked up, faster, more fervid than before. I look at the time on my phone: 3:02 am.  In one minute, the scratching would stop, same as it always did. I waited, watching the clock until the minute hand ticked over. When it did, the scratching stopped.

In the morning, I went to my garden to find the stone with Patches name on it. It’s been knocked aside, and the dirt underneath was as fresh as the day I buried him three years ago. 

His tiny bell tinkled when the blade of the shovel struck his box. 

I set his box aside, then dug down and buried him two feet deeper."

Phoebe warns him not to spread the news to everyone as this could create unnecessary panic.


Jona assembles a team of five boys Kavin, Gowrishankar, Goutham and Moulish. He tells them to search different places.
 

Kavin enters the elevator to go the terrace. Halfway through, Suddenly, the elevator stops and the light goes off. Kavin keeps knocking the door and shouts for help. But nobody hears him. He starts to suffocate and dies.

“The guy said it runs fine.” I told her, attempting to convince her the purchase was not only wise but savvy. “Not only that, he still had the user’s manual.  And the machine must be really high end, because the manual is bound in leather.” I held up the book with a smug smile. 

“That’s leather?” she asked, her nose curling in disgust.

“Sure,” I said. “But it’s for a snow blower, so the leather probably got wet or something and that’s why it’s so messed up.”

“Doesn’t look like leather,” she announced dismissively.

“It’s leather,” I said. “Has to be.”

“It’s gross,” she told me.

“It’s not gross, it just got wet at some point,” I told her again. “Stop acting like it’s made of human skin or something.”

“Whatever,” she said.  “I think you should be using a shovel when it snows.  You’re getting fat.”

“I’m not getting fat,” I lied, excitedly leafing through the pages. “This font is pretty weird,” I noticed aloud.

“Does it run on gas or electric?” my wife asked.

“I’m trying to find out,” I said, scanning.  I found something and paused. “This is strange,” I said aloud.

“What?” she asked.

“The power switch is behind the auger blades,” I told her.  “You’re supposed to reach in between the blades to turn it on.”

“Are you sure?” My wife’s eyebrows raised.

“That’s what it says,” I shrugged.

“Doesn’t sound right,” she told me.

“Well,” I said defensively, “it’s in the manual, and there’s no way they’d put wrong information in the manual.  They’d get sued.”

“Still doesn’t sound right,” she said again.

I shrugged. “If there’s another way, I can’t find it.  And these instructions seem very thorough.” I showed her an odd diagram I found.  “Do you think that’s a picture of the carburetor or something?”

“Carburetors are shaped like pentagrams?” my wife asked.

I closed the manual and put it on the kitchen counter. “I’m going to try it,” I told her.

“All right,” she said doubtfully.  “Be careful.”

I snorted, imagining how rapidly her skepticism was going to disappear when she saw how quickly I was able to do the driveway from now on. “Be careful,” I repeated with a chuckle, reaching for the garage door with my right hand for the last time. “What could possibly go wrong?”"
rknsox,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rknsox/ho_ho_oh/,Ho! Ho! Oh.,94,16,1640008484.0,"Hey,

Hope your evening’s going well, Santa Claus! Mine was ordinary, un-special, just another day really. I used to like this holiday. All the decorations and the promise of a special day with family. It seemed kinda magical—warm like dad’s laugh after the fifth eggnog. 

Now, the only real difference about this time of year seems to be a few more string lights. The whole hipstagram, Edison bulb, my backyard is a mood wedding craze kinda sunk the novelty of festive lighting though. Kinda fucked, eh, Nick?  Etsy’s come and snipped your jingle bells and and left a sad sack behind. 

I guess your special day does come with a few more Ariana Grande songs.  Hey! you two can sing castrato together. Fun!

Anyway, now that we’re feeling jolly, I wanna tell you about my family’s X-mas X-travaganza 2020. 

We stayed inside. For months. Duh. 

Wow, that was a roller coaster, right?  I got your present that year, by the way, and I hate to beat a dead reindeer, but again… Fun! Look at that—two ‘funs’. Now, if they were two ‘*Real Funs*’ my 2020 word puzzle book would tell me that I have enough letters for two F-U-N-E-R-A-Ls. Oh, words!

Fast forward time, Mr. Kringle. In 2021, I asked you for a book on flowers. Pretty sweet, right? Sensitive kid making bouquets for dear old mom or something. So cute, I know. 

Well, in 2020, the World Health Organization asked you to wear a goddamn mask. We stayed inside for months, saw no one, and after all that fear and boredom, you brought us Covid and two Real Fun Funerals for Christmas. One for dear old mom and one for dear old dad. 

Yeah. 

So look, St. Prickolas, this year I made you cookies and bought you milk. I’m sure you shoveled it down like the porcine goblin you are and I’m happy for you. The milk is skim because I hate you, but the cookies were baked with the same care my mom used to put into hers. Eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, flour and a new addition—flower. *Atropa belladonna*, according to last year’s gift. 

Deadly Nightshade. 

That fuzzy feeling you’ve got right now? It’s not the season, it’s impending cardiac paralysis. It’s me turning you into a holiday spirit. 

So, have a silent night and Merry Christmas, you fat red fuck. 

Yours Truly,

Tom

She was wearing a white dress that glittered like a diamond to show off her petite frame, crimson lips and eyes as blue as lightning storms.
 
“Hello Jack,” she whispered, her scarlet-tipped hands stroking my shoulder. 
 
I blushed. 
 
“I’m Melanie. It is a pleasure to meet you.”
 
“It’s a pleasure to meet you too,” I whispered. I was lost in those blue, blue eyes. It drew me in like a magnet, and my gaze stayed there.
 
We chatted for a while, and she even offered to pay for my drink. Soon it was like we had known each other for a long time. We walked out of the bar, holding hands, giggling like lovestruck teenagers.
 
The rest of the night passed like a dream. We bought ice cream, watched a horror movie, and kissed passionately under the stars. My own life back at home vanished. Only Melanie mattered.
 
As we were walking out of the movie theatre, a man ran by us, shrieking. His eyes were wild like he had just seen a ghost, and his clothes were tattered and torn. I watched as he stood at a street-corner, yelling drunkenly about his dead wife.
 
Melanie pressed a silver dagger into my palm. Her storm-blue eyes riveted onto mine.
 
“Will you kill for me?”

The words were out of my mouth without a second thought.
 
“Yes, my love.”
 
I crept towards the man, determined to impress Melanie. The man was still rambling. He had not even turned around.
 
Then I stabbed.
 
Blood exploded out of his back and dribbled down his clothes. The man shrieked as he crumbled to his knees and then to the floor. Already there was a deep pool of crimson expanding around him.
 
I heard voices behind me. I turned around to see shell-shocked white faces staring back at me. Many were yelling in confusion; some had their phones out, either recording the scene to post on social media or calling somebody. Probably the police.
 
Melanie wasn’t there. It was like she never existed at all.

It wasn’t long before the police arrived, sirens flashing. Standing there with a knife in my hand, blood on my clothes, and eyewitnesses down the street was enough evidence to find me guilty. I was sentenced to life imprisonment nearly immediately.
 
As I sat in my cell, angry that I threw my life away because of a woman I never knew, the door suddenly flew open as if by magic.
 
And there she was, in her diamond-white dress. Smiling at me.
 
She glided into my cell and took my hand into hers. Melanie smiled at me and all my anger vanished.
 
She led me to a prison guard, his back turned towards me, pressing another silver dagger into my palm.
 
“Will you kill for me?” she whispered.
 
And at that moment, nothing else mattered."

“Dave!”

The shouting came. This panic was caused by the disaster that was behind him. He tried to remember what to do in these situations.

*Now, for this new prototype we have to be careful with it. The idea is that this robot is a general purpose piece of machinery. Dave wants us to make sure it’s in operating condition for use in public.*

The prototype was gone. And the room had shown evidence of its escape. Computers thrown against the walls with a massive force behind it. Anger had sprayed towards the smashed up people on the floor; their faces beyond recognition. Lights flickering and dying as the dreadful noises of the metal footsteps coming closer to the worker as he was running for his life towards his boss’s office.

“DAVE!”

*It should not be acting like this. We have been getting occurrences where the prototype's behaviour has been performing more rebellious actions than what we originally programmed it to do. Dave needs to fix this. If these occurrences continue then the prototype will begin to exhibit hostile behaviour. Perhaps we need to activate a hard reboot and restart the coding.*

It did not work. The prototype suddenly crashed out of it’s cage and distributed chaos and blood across the facility of New Connolly’s Robotics. For whatever reason, something happened. And it wasn’t the coding. The worker broke the door down towards Dave’s office. He shouted with terror and panic.

“THERE’S BEEN AN ACCIDENT!”

He could only slightly see with the flickering of the dying lights, his boss, outstretched across his desk and his face dashed. And documents scattered across the floor. The worker picked them up and inspected with horror as he read:

*The prototype will be functioning with a human consciousness. The theory here is that with this, robots will be able to understand us humans, they should be able to abide by our commands. The human however will be my son, Francis.*

Francis Connolly was supposed to be in the hospital. He had suffered from a long-term disease that had left him bed-ridden. He was only 9 years old. The worker would not be able to absorb this information as the power to the whole facility went out. Fumbling and whimpering in the dark, the worker was trying to make his way by grabbing onto the walls, desperately attempting to make a path. In the corner, however, he could see with a tipped over desk lamp a tall black replica of a skeleton seemingly crying in the corner. It was Francis.

“O-oh god!”

Francis turned around, showing white glowing eyes and silver gnashing teeth as it screeched a perish cry of fear and pushed the worker down the stairs leading up to the office. He let out a scream as he was falling. His neck cracked on impact."

For exaple, rumors have begun to come out about this code that someone has developed in Russia. This code can be ""hidden"" in the back end of a site displaying plain text. This text can be anything - a Facebook post, a commnt on a YouTube video, a job listing - and to the end user, that's all it will appear to be.

However, the code that's running has already begun its purpose. A trigger is sent out though the webpage, and subtle manipulations begin to take place. According to some reports, people who have been exposed to this text have reported feeling a kind of paranoia that they can't quite place. They mention seeing shadows around them, in the peripherals of their vision, shadows that will move closer and close to them as the days go by. The reader will start to loose focus in their day to day activities, instead worrying about these shadows, these phantom invaders. Slowly, their paranoia overtakes them, until they are no longer functioning as the members of society they once were.

This is all very hard on those close to the reader, or, more accuratel, the victim. Family members have expressed their grief over loosing their loved ones to whatever is happening to them. Often, the vitim becomes resentful of their families for not seeing the shadows as they do. Rifts form, and relationships are severed. These tend to be the best case scenarios.

Sometimes, victims turn violent. Tey believe the shadows ae a significant threat to themselves, their families, the world at large. So twisted these people grow, that they might decde anyone who says they believe in the shadows MUST be working for them, maybe even, one of them. People have been attacked. There have been deaths.

This proces, this corruption, can take years, but it's effects can be quickened when in isolation. The most extreme cases tend to be from individuals who don't have a strong connecion with their families or friends. They keep to themselves, fearing the shadows, until they reach a breaking point.

It can seem tough to reach these people at this point. But it isn't ipossible. The way to help them, to cure them, is to reach out, connect with them. Conversations need to take plce. Many long conversations, about the shadows, about the text, about their relationhips, and their beliefs. Only by getting to the root of the problem, and establishing and empathetic connection, will these people be truly freed.

And all of this just from reading some random text on the internet. I guess I have no real reason to bring this up. I just find it fascinating..."

Sanam soon realised there was nothing she could do about the pot of dead flowers hanging in a macrame plant holder from a sturdy hook in the corner of living room. There was nothing she could do, because nothing was there. She was the only one who could see it. 

It had not been there when they had viewed the house. As the cruel gods who determined such things would have it, it was only after the lease was signed and they had moved in that she saw it hanging there, immobile. She had walked into the living room with her husband Paul, and cried out, “What the hell is that thing?”

Paul looked at her. “What is what?”

She had gestured over to hanging pot.

“That!”

Paul walked over, right through the hanging pot, and peered at the freshly-painted wall. “I’m not seeing anything, darling. Looks like they did a nice job here.”

Sanam opened her mouth, looked at Paul inspecting the wall, and then closed it again. 

They furnished in the house in the Scandinavian style they both admired- sleek pieces of furniture setting off the light grey walls, a couple of large white and silver modernist paintings hanging just so on the walls. The garish ceramic pot hanging in the knotted macrame ropes and the bunch of wilted dead flowers struck a discordant note and Sanam desperately googled how to get rid of visions and cleanse spaces- but to no effect. No matter how much sage she burned while Paul was at work, the hanging pot remained. 

A few weeks later, their new neighbour popped in and over a cup of tea, told Sanam about Martha, the tenant here who back in the seventies had hung herself “in this very living room, my dear. There used to be a hook there”- and she gestured to the sturdy iron hook holding the macrame ropes- “and they found her there hanging.”

Sanam gasped “That’s awful. Why?”

\-Her husband. A brute. And there wasn’t much she nor anyone else could do. Police were called to their house several times- always let him off. We had just moved here then- I ran into him a couple of times, a quiet looking fella, but a devil inside, so they said. 

She left, and Sanam walked back into the living room. 

And screamed. 

Hanging from the hook was the corpse of a woman. 

Sanam grabbed her laptop and rushed from the room. She began googling frantically. 

Luckily, Martha’s husband had not moved far, and lived a solitary life. It took Sanam only a few days to find him and kill him- not being connected with him in any way, it had been easy enough to cover her tracks. 

When she got back home, she went straight to the living room. The hook and the hanging flowers, hanging woman had all gone. Sanam smiled at the empty space, and started arranging the giant bunch of flowers she had bought on the way home."

Beth was always the golden child in the family and couldn't do anything wrong in anyone's eyes. She has crashed over 6 cars in total but it is always someone else's fault. 

Beth took over my wedding planning and tried to make the whole day about her. It took me threatening to just elope to bring her in line. She decided to announce a ""pregnancy"" during our reception which conveniently died a few days later.

She has a really strict beauty setup that she sticks to. I will admit that her skin does look flawless. I originally agreed to supply her with particular materials as I could easily get it from work.

Unfortunately I got a new manager lately and they have  been keeping a closer eye on things. I had to break the bad news to Beth and she was beyond livid. She kept demanding that I find a way to get more for her. 

She showed up at my job in the childrens hospital and started to scream at me in front of my coworkers. I tried to calm her down but she wouldn't listen to me. She threatened to tell everyone what I was doing unless I provided her with more virgins blood to bathe in"

He’d lain in bed for three days now, and only rarely been strong enough to open his eyes, let alone speak. The doctors would come in and tip a glass of water to his lips, like a child. Then they would slide food, mushy and soft, into his mouth, like an infant. He’d pissed himself three times.

It was a shameful state for a man of his stature. Right now, he was alone. They thought he was sleeping. Probably the doctors would be along again shortly to feed him. 

He knew he was dying, and the thought filled him with terror. He was the Great Genius of Communism. The Father of Nations. He feared nothing. He had come to power by sheer force of will. He had mown down his enemies like wheat. He had bathed his feet in their blood. But now he was afraid.

He was a good Marxist. There was no soul. No God. That was all bourgeois nonsense. Wasn’t it?

He wondered which of the bastards would take charge when he was gone. Beria? Kaganovich? 

Then a bolt of pain shot through his chest, and an unbearable heat settled over him. He tried to suck in a breath, and found it was like breathing through a hot, wet cloth. Why was it so hot? He needed a drink of water.

He tried to call out to the doctors. Could not. His lips wouldn’t work.

How had it gotten so hot?

His old heart roared in his chest.

Finally, he heard the familiar voice— “ah, there you are, Comrade Stalin.” The room grew hotter and hotter, but a deep relief poured over him as he realized one of the doctors must have come in to tend to him. 

But the voice was familiar. Yes, it was familiar. But not one of the doctors’ voices. A voice he hadn’t heard for a long, long time.

The room grew hotter and hotter still, and an incredible terror seized him. 

“It’s been too long, Comrade Stalin.” 

It was Trotsky’s voice."
rkejan,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rkejan/0/,0%,591,20,1639974239.0,"Many great scientific discoveries have been triggered by curiosity but we downplay the role of spite. My academic career was acceptable but I'd never have invented anything if it wasn't for Jeffrey White.

Years ago, I thought I'd found a new beetle species. Sadly, tests showed that the beetle was merely suffering from an uncommon affliction. Was I angry? Nope.

Until one of the techs who had thought one of the other beetles looked 'weird' found out it was a new species entirely. He didn't gather the beetles, didn't do the testing and sent it off just to avoid an afternoon's work. Still, all credit went to him.

Jeffrey *fucking* White.

Enraged, I changed my focus of research from beetles to insect identification. Years later I came to the shocking conclusion that a device which would correctly identify an insect's species would work for any species at all.

The lab know my general ideas but have no idea whatsoever that I've built anything - much less that I've sneaked it home.

I decide to scan my cat, Bast. If this device is even slightly successful then I will go down in history - as my first subject perhaps she'll join me.

I type 'cat' into the 'suspected species' box and scan.

**Suspected species: cat - 0% match 
UNREGISTERED SPECIES**

""*Unregistered?* It's a cat!"" I yell.

Despite my outburst, Bast has remained exceptionally still. I hear a voice echo in my head.

*""You can't know about me.""*

Bast shimmers as if she isn't quite there.

*""This device should not exist.""*

The edges which once outlined a cat are unclear. They are not blurry, but if I try to ascertain comprehend its form my mind lurches.

*""We cannot allow existence of a device which could find us.""* the creature says.

My device is destroyed by a limb I can barely see. I stand up to run, but it's far too late.

*""We cannot allow existence of the human that made it.""*

I'm stabbed and the thing folds itself into a cat shape again.

I slowly sinking to the floor, I remember all of the times I talked to Bast about my plans. She knows my colleagues know so little that nobody can replicate my device.

Bast pads over to me and I wonder what she really was. When I look at her I don't see the monstrous thing which killed me. I see the sweet tabby I've known and loved for years.

I fade in and out of consciousness and yet I don't panic. Bast's soft fur touches my twitching palm and I wonder if she caused my sense of calm. Perhaps she remembers my kindness to her as a cat and choses to ease the suffering of the threat she couldn't allow to live.

My life's greatest work will remain unknown. Yet as I lie dying I feel pride and, for the first time, a feeling of peace.

Whatever Bast is, she is dangerous.

Yet, in some ways, she is merciful."

I consider myself quite the brave gal and would go to the part of the basement that would never light up just so I could sneak up on my guy friends, shoot them in the back and take their gun  for the rest of the round. 

One day as we were playing airsoft in the basement, I decided to go as far back as possible in the dark part with no light shining from my phone or anything. All of my guy friends started talking about how it feels like cheating that I go into an area only I’m willing to go into. I just stayed quiet and waited for one of them to lower their guard. After about 15 minutes, I started noticing it was so cold in my hiding spot compared to the rest of the basement and it soon felt like I was being watched. I dismissed it at first and chalked it up to paranoia, but then I heard  and felt someone or something breathing on my neck. “Come on! Stop messing with me!” I turned around expecting to see one of my friends and all that was behind me was the wall. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I seemed to be enveloped in darkness for a few moments before sprinting out of the basement entirely.

After that experience, every time I went down to the basement, I didn’t feel as alone as I once did."
rkblgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rkblgs/quin_with_one_n/,Quin With One N,351,33,1639964858.0,"My usual coffee place is closed. For a very stupid reason. They only hired one person for the night shift, which is when I go there, and she is home sick tonight. I'll never get why everyone thinks I'm the town idiot when there's people like that place's manager. Anyways, I can't go without my before-work tea, so it's off to the chain cafe I go.

Inside, it's cold and smells like paint in a bad way. There are tiny tables with normal people at them, and it feels disproportionately slow walking up to the counter. I clutch my bag. The barista seems as young as me, and far more perky. She looks me up and down and smiles, and I momentarily fear she's planning to pickpocket me. But she doesn't, and I order the same tea I had for over a year. I like routine.

""So, you got a name to go with that?""

I almost protest, (or have a panic attack,) when I hear that, before realizing she meant she wanted to write it on the cup. I don't like that.

""Quin. With one N.""

""Isn't that a girls' name?""

""Not in this case.""

""Alrighty.""

She takes longer to write my name than to make the drink, which tastes weird. I go out to the car, where my partner (business partner, not the gross kind,) is waiting. We go to tonight's stop, a half-boarded-up, graffitied abandoned house same as any other. My partner gives me a brief on the job.

""Human, assumed female, confirmed dead. We don't know the threat level if there is one.""

""Just a routine sketch-and-scratch, right?""

""Yep. Get a good drawing of the subject, note behavior, get her to talk if you can. Be safe.""

""I'm never not safe.""

I leave her to play on her phone and enter the house. Far less scary than the cafe. I wander around, pulling out my notebook, until I see her. The subject. She doesn't scream. This subject seems docile. Sad, with that emaciated figure, decades-old clothes, and a trio of bleeding holes in her chest, but at least harmless. I watch from the shadows as she paces around what used to be a bedroom, humming a song I don't know.

I draw her entire upper half realistically. Scribble down everything she does. Note how she goes translucent at the sound of a tree branch scratching the window. Satisfied, I leave unnoticed. All in all, a pretty normal job. I know I should have tried talking to her, but today just isn't a talking day. I may not socialize well, but I've got very special skills that make this type of job easier, if not more profitable.

Returning to the car and reminding myself to greet my partner before handing her the notebook to look over, I go to take a sip of my left-behind tea, stopping to read to the cup. That's when I notice the barista wrote my name as ""*Quinn With One N""*."
rkbj2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rkbj2v/i_was_the_polaroid_kid/,I was the Polaroid kid,13,1,1639964655.0,"When I was a kid I was known as the Polaroid kid and this was before the time of digital cameras. Have you ever put both your hands together and pretended to take a picture of something as a joke or just playing around, well whenever I put my hands together in a triangle shape position, a Polaroid picture would come out of my mouth. I never knew how this was possible but I learnt to live with it and I enjoyed taking picture with my hands, like literally. I put both my hands together to mimic a camera at whatever takes my fancy and then a photo comes out of my mouth of the thing I was interested in. 

I thought people at school would find me to be a freak but they loved me and I took pictures of so many people by just putting my hands together, and they didn't even mind the photo coming out of my mouth. They called me the Polaroid kid and I loved school. I use to take pictures of people whenever I wanted and nobody minded and I always gave them the picture even though it came out of my mouth. I loved my school years but with my best years being in high school, life changed for me afterwards. As technology changed to digital cameras and then the invention of phone cameras coming out, I went out of date just like the Polaroid cameras. 

From once being cool in school I was now the freak, and taking pictures of people without permission by putting both my hands together and a photo coming out of my mouth was now seen as disgusting. How times have changed and I grew so depressed and I wanted to go back to my high school years. The golden years were behind me and I wanted those golden years back and I had been forgotten. 

I was homeless once and when I tried taking a photo of a man on the street by putting both my hands together, he told me to stop. He called me disgusting when the photo came out of my mouth and when I went up to his and forced both his hands to be in a triangle shape, I took a picture with it and the photo started to come out of his mouth but he choked and died. 

My best years are way behind me."

The cheery voices drift from your front porch. The melody is beautiful and well-performed. It would be a treat to listen to . . .

“Here we come a-wandering so fair to be seen . . .”

. . . if you hadn’t heard it a hundred times. Literally. Just this one song.

“Love and joy come to you! And to you your wassail, too!”

It’s been three days. Three days of scarfed and mittened carolers at your front door. How are they not exhausted? Has anyone eaten anything?

“And God bless you and send you a happy New Year . . .”

They’re so loud. They drown out everything. You can barely hear yourself think. You tried to watch TV, but you couldn’t hear the actors. You put in your noise-canceling earbuds and sighed with relief as Ryan Reynold’s voice filled your ears . . .

. . . only for him to sing, his voice joined by a familiar chorus.

“And God send you a happy New Year!”

You tried earplugs. You tried white noise machines. You tried opening the door and screaming at them to stop.

Nothing worked.

“Our wassail cup is made of the rosemary tree . . .”

You called the police. The operator started singing. You texted your friends, your family, your crazy ex-girlfriend you vowed to never speak to again. All their responses were lyrics, matching the voices rising outside.

“And so is your beer of the best barley!”

You’ve thought of gouging your eardrums out. You’ve thought of slitting your wrists. And yet, when you go to do it, you can’t. The music worms its way into your ears, cheerful and bright.

“Love and joy come to you! And to you your wassail, too!”

It just wants to make you happy. And it does, doesn’t it? Why are you fighting happiness?

“And God bless you and send you a happy New Year!”

You grab your coat. It’s chilly out, and your hands are already going numb, but one of the carolers offers you a pair of mittens. You grin at them, your mouth opening to say thank you. But that’s not what comes out.

“And God send you a happy New Year!”"

My life took a fortunate turn when the wheel of the slave train broke free. Soon they would notice my absence and come chasing. 


The shimmer of green and gold sprinkled down from the night sky, it danced between the trees lighting my way.  Out of breath, I leant against a tree. I was lost in a forest I didn't know. The bay of hounds chose the path for me. The crunching of leaves a deadly betrayer.


With each whip of a branch and sharp edge of a tree, I stumbled on. I had to get away. I couldn't be captured again. A thick root caught my foot and I fell hard, grazing my head. 


There, nestled at the trunk was the carcass of a dead bird. An old spell came to mind. One forbidden. One that held a terrible price. Howling sounded like it came from all around. My time was running out. 


With the tips of my nails, I played a melody on the dead bird's ribs. A haunting clicking filled the trees. As the tune rose and fell, the bird's head twitched. Those chasing me stopped, gazing skywards. There to stand until death took them.


As the melody died, the bird began to convulse, skin peeled around it. Feathers sprung forth. Soon chirping filled the air and I was free. 


For weeks I traveled, the bird on my shoulder, whispering into my ear. Each town watched me suspiciously. But they couldn't stop the price I had to pay. Drunk men were the easiest. The bird ate their soul. Pulling it through the eyes after it had feasted on them. 


After a month my laboured steps entered my village. Our homes were high in the trees, out of the way of predators. Little did they know one was now in their midst. There was only one price left to pay. One left for every man still gazing up in that forest of freedom. Ten I had promised with the spell. Nine had been delivered. 


From the branches I heard the cry. My daughter, eyes wide and arms stretched, had seen me. The last price. The bird whispered as the leaves crunched. As the shouts went up. As my daughter raced to greet me. 


All the magic in the world couldn't save me now. In the fold of my cloak, my fingers curled around the knife. One more price for my freedom. My daughter's face went from joy to shock, to fear. The blade flashed. Blood spilled. 


One more price. I whispered. 


The bird jumped down. Tiny feet skittered the leaves, readying to eat the eyes. My daughter gasped at the blade protruding from my neck. She didn't understand. I had fought to keep sane enough to not kill her. 


The spell demanded one more price for my freedom, but they couldn't have it. Couldn't have her. It would have to settle for me. "

I spend every single day paying $1.99 for ten chapters, and I devour them. Some are laughable, most are tacky, and sometimes the vamps sparkle... I don't care. 

There's a rather prolific writer of vampire trash that I follow: Jenna DeMarco. She's written 65 novels, and she's not a bad writer. Yes, the stories are formulaic, yes, it's not intellectually stimulating. And yes, I can think of lots more I could've done with the roughly $500 dollars I've sent here over the last almost year, but, I'd call my trashy e-novels my ""ciggies"". I rationalized that at least my guilty pleasure wasn't giving me cancer.

I'm currently on chapter forty-five of ""The Blood Prince's Virgin Bride"". The heavy breasted virgins with waist length raven hair, and crystal clear blue eyes being enthralled by white haired, muscular and articulate princes of darkness... So corny, so sexy... So damned entertaining!!!

'Jenna DeMarco' is a frumpy, fifty-two year old woman called Jennifer Lee who lives with her husband Bobby and their fur baby Thaddeus. She loves sitting in the park near their house, while writing. I met her accidently on purpose one Saturday morning. 

My thick mahogany hair hung in loose waves that day. My breasts strained against the thin fabric of my crop top and my heat shaped ass perfectly filled out my jeans. My blue eyes sparkled as we spoke about vampires, romance and how men just don't quite understand how to give a woman pleasure.

She's so flattered that I've read her books. She's blushing and stammering. I brush her hair out of her face. God, she's beautiful to me.

I tell her as much....
""Oh Joelly,"" she gushes. ""How can someone who looks like YOU find me attractive?“
The park is empty, the sun sets and fills the sky with brilliant hues.

""Attractive? I never said attractive.... Are you attracted to a juicy steak when you're hungry? And I don't play with my food,"" I reply, mouth watering."

Yeah, right. The ‘plants’. I didn’t like the house plants, they make too much of a mess and take too much looking after. The yellow, stained ceiling stares back at me as I lazily move my neck to look up. Ugh, those vines just grow longer and longer, thicker and thicker. They make a mess too, even my wife is tired of cleaning it up sometimes. Ugh.

‘Goodness me, they look like they’re about to dry out and die! I should really water them!’

Die? Good. It really would be a relief if they finally dried up and dropped. I’m sick of those plants. And their leaves are so sharp and icky, they glue my fingers together and cut me when I rub against them. I want to stand up and deal with them this time, but she moves before I even have a chance to.

‘Oh honey, it’s like I always do all the work around them, hee hee! Just some water will surely make them spring back to life, let me get..’

My eyes widen. No no, please don’t make them stronger. They’re already causing me enough trouble. Please, they really don’t need the water, they’re better drying up and dying...

She brings the glass of water up to my face. I should be shivering, but I can’t. Too tight. The mellow shades of the living room blur together as she waters the plants. 
Their stalks get even thicker, they regain their black tone and curl even tighter around my neck and body. Ugh, too tight, I can’t breathe... why did she insist on doing this? Far too tight. I’m bound to this chair, and she keeps watering them. Let me go. KILL THEM.

‘Oh honey, what a mess they’ve made! Well, I guess the plants can get a little messy sometimes...’

Yet, I felt it was inhabited.”*

I find myself walking down a street I don’t recognize. As I glance around, I immediately feel a sense of calmness overtake me, although what I am seeing should not make me feel this easy. Everything here is desolate, washed out by the years and the salt in the air. This place could truly be frozen in time if I wasn’t there. Apart from the light howling of the wind, the only other sound is the one of my footsteps, resonating on the pavement. 

As I arrive at a left turn, I see an opening between two buildings, with just a white metal fence no higher than my waist connecting them. I fasten my pace to take look and get a better idea of where I am. It takes a few moments to register what I am seeing. 

It is very foggy, but I can see the shore from where I stand. The waters are very still and barely make any foam when they hit the rocks. The sky is grey and the sun is nowhere to be seen. The horizon would be completely even, if not for a darker, mysterious shape I can’t quite understand at first, casting its shadow in the fog.

I lean onto the fence and focus my attention on what appears to be standing on a mass of land, not that far off in the distance. It’s just an island, but what confuses me is the huge building on top of it, looming over this place, in an almost menacing way. There is a single pillar, of impossible geometry, supporting what I can only try to describe as something resembling the Parthenon. This CANNOT exist, yet it is there, and it is inviting me.

In the meantime, let's spread a little holiday chaos with the annual Holidays contest for 2021!

Let us once again leave out plates of milk and cookies to spoil and get stale while we wait for an obese stalker man who's been watching you all year judging if you've been naughty or nice. You've never seen him, though. He's only spoken about as a legend. Many celebrate his arrival into their homes as he breaks and enters through the chimney and does whatever he pleases in your home while you and your family are asleep. Typically, he leaves presents, but if there's a bad person, he'll leave coal. Clearly, he is a deranged man who cares nothing for climate change, even though it is melting his own home and factory where his slave labor mass produces products to give away for free. 

Welcome this man into your homes and tell your children to worship him! 

SATAN!

Whoops...

I mean, SANTA!

##RULES AND REGS##

* Stories must be ""Holiday"" themed. This is clearly limited to the December holidays.

* Contest entries must be tagged with [The Holidays 2021]. No-tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are seen, with the capitalization of the ""T"" in The and the ""H"" in Holidays and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results. For example, during our /r/SleepSpell competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged precisely as the search I listed. So please, please, please, use the tag exactly as it is listed.

* All entries must adhere to the standard subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. Once every 24 hours, as per usual. 

* Previous contest winners within the last year DO NOT qualify to win the prizes. You may participate, if you'd like. Author of the Month winners are allowed to participate and DO qualify for prizes. They may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions!

* The story with the highest amount of upvotes wins the contest and prizes. The next four highest upvoted stories will receive honorable mentions in the winner's circle. There is no prize for honorable mentions. Unfortunately, I am not a rich man and cannot provide rewards to all. 

* If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the authors' winners circle. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times, but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests have had up to 7+ authors included in the winner's circle due to ties and multiple placements.

I’m screaming.,17,0,1639937537.0,"My friend and I saw a ghost. I know, but there’s no other way to explain what we saw. It happened this Saturday just gone at the halls of residence where we live. 

So, it’s early afternoon, and my bags are packed. I’d be gone already, but I can’t get a lift until tomorrow. The other students have left, and the place has fallen eerily quiet. There’s only me and my mate, Ben, in the whole building.

At least, that’s what I thought. Because I’m hearing shuffling noises coming from the room next to mine. 

It’s Adam’s room, in between mine and Ben’s. I thought he’d gone as well. I mean, I overheard him on the phone during the week, and it was pretty clear he was going to be leaving on Friday. In fact, yesterday teatime I heard him lock his door and go. It’s been silent since then. Until now, that is, so I’m guessing he’s still in.

So, I’m lying on my bed and staring at the ceiling—listening to those noises, which come and go. But they’re not the noises Adam usually makes, like a trip to the bathroom or preparing food. They’re sort of… slowly pacing. Long periods of silence, then slow, ominous creaking of floorboards.

I decide to take a nap. But just as I drop off, I snap awake with the impression that I’d been hearing whispering in my ear. There’s an evil new idea in my head, and I exchange messages with Ben. We’re gonna play a prank on Adam.

It’s nighttime. There’s an air vent leading from my room into Adam’s, and another one between Adam’s and Ben’s. Ben places his phone between the slats of his air vent, and I feed a long net curtain wire into Adam’s room. 

The other end of the wire touches the sleeping Adam, and he freaks out. Footsteps go thudding toward the light switch, and I withdraw the wire. I sit in front of my laptop and enjoy the spectacle, courtesy of the live feed from Ben’s phone.

I’m wondering why Adam has put his bedsheet over his head. He walks toward the other air vent and stops for a while. Then he turns to face the wall next to my room and walks toward it. 

Then he walks straight through it. 

I leap up from my chair and stare at the wall, expecting him to come through, but nothing emerges. Adam’s room is empty. I unlock the door and run out into the hallway. Ben’s standing outside his room, looking as shocked as I am.

It’s Sunday, and we confess our crimes to another student, who points out our prank is not possible to pull off because of the configuration of the air vents. We can’t prove otherwise because Ben’s camera recorded no images. However, it did record some audio. When the specter stood facing Ben’s air vent, the audio picked up a raspy-sounding voice. It said, “Merry Christmas.”"

Van Owen sneered and pulled him down. ""We get paid to do it, thats why.""

""Sumbitch"" Roland murmured, and patted the barrel of his rifle. It was perhaps the hundredth time this evening that he had done so, and the habit was rapidly starting to annoy Van Owen. He sneered again and considered hitting his partner over the head. But cathartic as it would have been, he could not fault Roland for getting twitchy. The two men were experienced killers and had mastered many dangerous situations together. But this...this was something else entirely. 

""We should leave"" said Roland and stood up. ""This is not a good idea.""

""Get down again you fool!"" hissed Van Owen, his own nervousness seeping into his voice ""Are you insane? We would write off the biggest bounty of our careers! And never find work again! What has gotten into you?""

""The sumbitch has strange powers."" Roland patted the barrel of his rifle again ""They say that he can fly though the air. And he punishes people who do evil. We should get out of here as long as we have the chance, I tell you."" 

Van Owen grinned wolfishly. ""Powers or not...a bullet through the brain puts everyone into the grave. And besides, we are not *doing* anything evil. We are doing our jobs. And saving our clients business.""

Roland made motion to protest, but a look from Van Owen shut him up. ""Noise"" mouthed Van Owen and pointed upwards. Roland, realizing that it was too late to back out, reacted at lightning speed. He crouched down behind the sofa, getting his weapon ready. Van Owen raised his revolver, ready to cover his partner. 

A few seconds later they emerged from their hiding space and opened fire on the red-clad figure who had just come down through the chimney. 

""Ho, ho, ho you sumbitch!"" cried Roland ""Best wishes from the toy and games industry!"""

I browsed for an ‘Adult-Sized Mirror’ on your esteemed website, fletchersreflectivesurfacesandmirroresquedoohickeys.com, a fortnight ago, and - as is the learned way of determining a household items quality - I of course found the one with the most scandinavian name imaginable. 

*Mære.*

Admittedly I was also quite intrigued by the product’s description, ‘*SOMEONE ELSE’S REFLECTION*’, a statement I assumed was in reference to the image on the website - where you definitely could see a warped figure reflected in the mirror's top right corner.

In the end, the choice was easy enough, and I ordered the *Mære* forthwith, eagerly awaiting its arrival in no more than ‘three-to-five business days’. 

Imagine then my surprise when I found the mirror mounted on my bedroom wall minutes later. I quickly perused the website again, and I suppose I must have misread it after all, because it undoubtedly said ‘three-to-five business *minutes*’ this time around?

Bizarre.

In any case, you should never detooth a gift horse's mouth, or so the saying goes, and as such I drifted off that night staring at my own weary face reflected in the marvellously clear surface of the *Mære*.

It took me a while to notice the warped figure in the corner, and to my dismay I found myself frozen in sleep paralysis, helplessly watching as she moved from top to bottom, from right to left, ever so slowly - and to my utter displeasure - becoming less warped and more focused by the minute.

She had a face only a blind mother could tolerate, and even then only on copious amounts of reality-numbing drugs. Too many sharp edges, too many wrinkles, like knives draped in folds of human skin. She moved on spindly limbs ending in bulgy stubs - devoid of fingers or toes, like fleshy tissue sponges softening her every step. 

She climbed over my unresponsive body, and I could *feel* her moist breath staining my face now, a sickly scent of unborn death and rotting promise dripping down my brow. And then - to my utter perplexity and bewilderment - she *continued* moving, coming to a rest instead atop the sleeping figure of my *wife*.

I spent the remainder of the night forced to watch as that *Mare of the Night* tore open the body of my paralyzed wife, climbed into her, devoured her from the inside-out, then the outside-in, ending then on the backside-front. (Or was it the front side-back? I forget).

I suppose my stance should be crystal clear by now, but on the off chance you’ve yet to catch on:

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR PRODUCT 

My wife passed away years ago, so being able to see her every night in the mirror is pure heaven. Sure, she’s in excruciating pain, effectively being eaten alive by the *Mære*, but I choose to believe that’s merely a memory of her. A hallucination.

Any other truth would be far too horrible to imagine."

For one, she always *smells*, like she spends all her free time hanging out in trash cans or something. For another, her face is always wet and slimy. Her nails are filled with icky green gunk.
 
Then she is covered with maggots.
 
Brown worms the size of your finger are always sliding and crawling all over her face and squirming under her eyelids, treating it like her own personal circus. Eggs push out of her face and arms and legs like bulbous tumours, always bubbling beneath the surface. Then they will crack, and new maggots will come to light.
 
It’s disgusting on paper; and it’s even more disgusting to see her in person. All the kids hate her. And they can be cruel too, holding their noses when Claire walks by, or even spitting at her. Claire is tormented day by day, and half the time she isn’t called Claire, but by a completely different name.
 
Maggot Face.
 
Even the TEACHERS call her that. And sometimes the teachers can be as cruel as the kids.
 
I have always felt sorry for Claire. I sit next to her at lunch, and we talk about things, like two ordinary girls. I am one of the only people in school who knows her real name is Claire, for instance. I also ignore the other… *quirky* parts of her personality. Like how she has a name for every single maggot on her face, and talks to them like they’re *human*.
 
“Claire, they’re not even alive. They don’t know what you’re saying to them,” I say.
 
Claire glares at me, covering as many maggots as she could with her hands. “Don’t talk about them that way! They have *feelings*.”
 
I sigh. Claire can be stubborn at times.
 
I never regretted hanging out with Claire. Until one day I feel particularly sick.
 
My temperature spikes up to 39.5, and I am covered in an itchy red rash that won’t go away.  My body is drenched in sweat, and I won’t stop scratching. When the temperature subsides, I look at myself in the mirror.
 
I look *horrible*. The red rash has melted into bubbles that have risen up from my skin. I poke them. They feel soft and bouncy, but strangely rough at the same time.
 
Then the bubbles begin to crack.
 
A fresh maggot, brown as sludge, pokes its head out of one of the bubbles. Followed by another, and another. They slide and play and burrow in fresh skin, joyous as youth.
 
*We’re hungry!*
 
The voices speak directly into my mind, whining like a child. I go into the kitchen, find some lettuce, and slap it on my face. It is devoured in seconds.

I feed them more. MORE. They’re grateful, polite, each of them a joy. They’re my maggots. They’re my *babies*. I am their mother and I’ll do **anything** for them. I’m all they have.

For now."

A med student who was encircled by interested girls and a literature student on a scholarship nursing her stale beer crossed path a while later, got to talking and after a year of dating, we made it official. 

A dinner was planned for our families to finally meet,  I've only told my mom about Cyrus and asked her not to tell dad just yet, just in case something goes awry. You see, dad's always been very protective of me but eversince he came back from a hunting trip last year, he just wasn't the same anymore. 

The drive to the restaurant got my heart racing as I kept checking my appearance in my pocket mirror. The fact that I had rich people to impress justified my stress. Cyrus would give me a reassuring smile and upon meeting his parents, I was engulfed in warm hugs that got me thinking, Cyrus was right. 

My folks arrived just 5 minutes after us and to my surprise, dad was social. His voice boomed during that dinner, like joy found itself in his system again which made mom and I share a look of relief. We went home to our respective houses after and before I could excuse myself to wash, dad asked me for a talk and what he said next made comfusion swim in my mind. 

""You can't see him anymore."" 

He stated that during his hunting trip, he decided to go on another trail for a change of game and when he was making his way down an incline, he saw Cyrus and his dad near their truck. Dad thought of approaching them in the hopes of having company but when he was about 100 yards away, the sight of their kill halted his steps and made him hide behind a bush. 

Laid on the ground was a bare and deceased woman who had small antlers attached to her head. 

I saw dad shake and take deep breaths as his eyes started to water,  it was as if he was still in those woods. He said that he couldn't tell authorities for he had no proof.

The image of my father so frightened and so small made my heart twist. I could only hug him and share his sorrow through my tears. 

A week before our return to the university I asked Cyrus to meet me at the local park. The screams of children filled the air as they played tag and I saw Cyrus looking at them with a smile on his face. 

I sat beside him on the bench, never leaving a distance just in case he'd get suspicious and before I could say my piece, Cyrus spoke without turning his attention to me that dropped the truth on what my father said

The bike throttled off. down the desert highway with blood on his jacket and his wits up. Red Harrison, the outlaw, had committed a crime. That crime was murder. He had just rushed away from Lavashallow and his Honda Rebel 1100 was not going to fail at this stage. His black biker jacket, gnawed gloves on the knuckles, scratched Kevlar jeans, tattered riding boots and menacing shaded helmet made a presence through the desert that he was running. He did not know, but he was going to improvise at this point. 

His Cruiser’s engine rumbled at the seams as he turned towards an isolated bar, he threw himself off the moment the bike stopped and ran inside, crushing the wooden doors in front of him. He trudged towards the bar-stand and slammed his fist onto the table.

“Rum. Sharp.” 

There was no bartender. There was no one there. Yet it seemed clean; as clean wood can be. The TV was still on, and Red looked at it:

*This just in. The local biker gang known as the “Blood Gods” have destroyed the town of Lavashallow. Local police have been reported onto the scene and it is utter carnage. From what we know, the Blood Gods are a merciless biker gang who reside in the outbacks of New Mexico and Arizona. They perform such crimes as highway robbery, gang “takeovers” and most notably today, downright genocide. One of the bikers had killed a young girl called Jennifer Griffin. This biker has been identified as Red Harrison, a local of Arizona and a fugitive.*

Harrison looked around and he could swear a shadow moved away from his eyes. Without a moment’s notice he pulled out his Colt Diamondback from his pocket and shot to the area where he believed the shadow to be. As he walked closer, the figure jumped out. A biker, but with long, grueling, dripping hair and spikes erected from his back and boots of the devil, hooved shaped, the voice of a deep growling engine. It jumped on Red, strangling him with its claws. Red was able to punch it in the stomach and grab it’s collar before being thrown out of the window; dragging the figure along with it.

The figure did not have time to get up, before Red rushed it and stomped its face into the ground with his boot. Grabbing a fire axe he swung it down to its body. 

He let out a sigh of relief, and opened the demon’s jacket to hunt for supplies. Only to find a picture of her. Jennifer. His mood went solemn as his mind went blank on the visuals of the girl. Sirens. Sirens. They were close. 

He placed the revolver back into his holster and revved his bike back up as he drove away into the desert winds, towards the desert of silence and death. 

Strange. It is usually the sand that soaks up the tragedy."

Footage of soldiers blasting their artillery against these creatures only to fail and die miserable deaths were broadcasted everywhere. Soon enough it would be clear that the only path to survival was to hide and move carefully, since getting the attention of even one of them meant imminent death as they would chase you down until they got to you. After only six months since the start of this apocalyptic event, to come across another human became almost impossible.

And then I found Eva, a little disheveled girl hiding in an abandoned gas station, surviving on candy bars and bottled water. She looked defenseless and I knew sooner or later she would end up being torn in pieces for no good reason.

In the beginning she was cautious of my intentions, nowadays people were willing to do anything if it meant they would be able to survive for a bit little longer.

Eventually, she finally ended up trusting me. My presence provided her a sense of safety and comfort. I grew fond of her as the days passed. She made me feel hopeful about my survival.

That didn't last, though. On one of our trips, as I was wandering through the aisles of a little store looking for any useful supplies, she came running to me whispering that one of those monsters had spotted her peaking through the door and was on their way to us at full speed. I asked her if she had opened the door enough for it to notice that she was not alone, and with a shaky voice she replied no.

I got on my knees and hugged her tight as tears started falling down her cheeks. She was smart enough to know that this meant the end. I quickly pushed my pocket knife on the back of her shoulder and shoved her little body to the ground. I knew the pain would prevent her from standing up and escaping from what was coming.

As l opened the back door of the store and made sure the coast was clear, I looked back for a split second at her terrified expression before closing the door behind me and sprinting out of there at full speed.

I could hear her screams fading the further away I got from the scene, and when I finally reached my safe house l felt anger. After all, I had already planned to use her as bait to clean out the area near a big supermarket full of supplies that could have lasted me for months.

Lately he has taken it upon himself to start singing to cheer people up. We were at one of my friends mothers funeral when he decided to start singing at the top of his lungs ""ding dong the witch is dead"".

Centered against the opposite wall of his otherwise ordinary looking bedroom, was a coffin. As my eyes swept over the hardwood floor and room’s furniture, I noticed the lack of a bed. At that moment my face fell.

Lorenzo spoke beside me. “You like it?”

“A coffin, seriously?” I huffed humorlessly. “Is it mine?” I joked, flatter than intended, sounding off-put.

“Uh, it’s definitely not for the corpses of my dates Eli, promise. It’s where I sleep actually,” Lorenzo said as he strolled forward, nervous hands in his pocket, until he reached it. He crouched, then lovingly stroked the polished dark pinewood exterior. “It’s uh actually inspired by my all-time favorite film. Dracula. You seen it?”

“Yep. Wasn’t the biggest fan,” I admitted through gritted teeth, trying not to cringe. “So what, you fancy yourself some kind of wannabe, or fanboy or something?”

“When you put it like that you sort of make me sound pathetic,” Lorenzo said, running a shaky hand over his curly, brown hair, looking abashed.

“I’m sorry. I don’t mean to sound harsh. It’s just that I’ve never—”

“Went on such an awkward first date with a weirdo?”

“Well… yeah,” I shrugged, genuine laughter slipping through as I felt a twinge of amusement.

After some time, once Lorenzo saw I appeared relaxed and humored, he spoke again.

“There’s space for two, if you’re wondering,” he said, patting the top. “It’s custom made, and I planned ahead for occasions like these.” At that he gave a coy wink, and I could hardly believe him.

“Even if I was crazy enough to say yes,” I said, “I don’t know. I’m not a fan of enclosed spaces.”

Lorenzo’s eyes flickered over in recognition of my unease. He walked forward then took my hand.

“I promise you’ll feel safer in my arms,” he said, ogling me with his doe eyes.

“Fine,” I moaned, stifling a grin, which earned a chuckle from him as he tugged me along, until we reached the gothic box-enclosure.

We let our clothes fall to the floor.

Next, he opened the lid, revealing a velvet padded interior we stepped into, me crouched over him with hands upon his chest. I shut the lid, enveloping us into a suffocating darkness.

‘’Relax. I’m here Eli. Just breathe,” said Lorenzo, already sensing my tense body language.

I nodded, breathing steadily as I held his shoulders and straddled him, which coaxed a pleasured groan from Lorenzo.

I buried my nose into the slope of his neck.

“There’s something you should know wannabe,” I breathed into his ear. “What the movies don’t tell you is how vampires would never sleep in this dumb box when predators *hate* feeling caged.”

When the earthquake hit the night before Christmas, he banged on my bedroom door.

“Max—you fat slug! Why are you shaking the house?”

I waited until he crawled back in bed, and then I began my search. I had heard of the stories of coal being put in stockings as a form of punishment. Even though Gary was an adult, the look on his face would provide a priceless Christmas morning memory.

Now, I had no clue where to find coal, but finding rocks would suffice. I snuck outside and wandered the yard in search of anything that looked even remotely close to coal. In the back of our yard, I spotted something glimmering in the dirt. I picked up the cluster of rocks and stuffed them in my pocket.

Our stockings were already hanging up, so I tiptoed over to Gary’s and emptied a handful of rocks. After getting a good night of sleep, I rushed downstairs into the living room. My mother and Gary were already on the couch waiting for my arrival.

“Stocking time! Honey, why don’t you get the fireplace going,” mom said.

Gary groaned and started up the fire. I rushed through the opening of my stocking, eagerly awaiting Gary to reach into his. 

“What the hell is this shit? Did you dump this in here Valerie?”

I giggled and Gary shot me an evil stare, like he was going to pummel me if I let one more chuckle slip. The glimmering rocks he held proceeded to hiss and pop and bounce around in his hand. He tried to release them, but the rocks seeped into his skin.

“It burns!” he shouted.

Gary stood up in front of the fireplace. His right hand grew to the size of his head. I could see the burrowed rocks traveling up his arm. Gary’s entire body inflated until he was as wide and tall as our front door. And then it happened. He exploded. Bloody chunks of my mother’s boyfriend painted the room.

Speechless and shocked, my mother and I walked into the backyard without saying a word to each other. And that’s when we saw it. The giant hole. I soon learned that what I discovered in the dirt the night before Christmas was a meteorite."

They called it Empowerment, but most used a simpler term: magic.

In the midst of the chaos of our decaying civilization, news of an accidental scientific discovery spread like wildfire through whispers and shaky video recordings. An elderly man ran a wrinkled finger along the base of his bonsai tree and it bloomed a rainbow. A couple sung in harmonic tones capable of putting insomniacs to sleep. A five-year-old spoke to animals, which followed his every command.

Debate erupted. “Would you get the injection?” was the new conversation topic everywhere. Rumors of returning the power back to the people went largely unsaid, but many knew that perhaps this miracle could finally turn the tables in our favor.

Doctors repeatedly went on-record stating that the side-effect was incredibly rare, with a far greater likelihood of developing rapid onset cancers the like of which had never been documented. Yet, before too long, the chemical compound had been stolen, copied, and distributed through each and every underground.

Millions died in a few short months.

And though I certainly considered it - hell, I even found a dealer - I couldn’t go through with it. Not after it took my sister, leaving me a niece to raise on my own.

It wasn’t until about a year later that people began to put the pieces together. Sure, there had been conspiracy theories: “why aren’t there new videos?” or “do you know anyone who knows someone who’s been empowered?” We all thought politicians and celebrities simply had too good of a life to bother with such a low chance of enchantment.

She said, “I love you.” I replied, “I love you too.” At that moment we joined hands and I closed my eyes. Then we hit the water. There was a flash of light, my last glimpse of day. Then it was dark. I was at peace. The water didn’t hurt like I thought it would have. It just stopped my movement.

He woke up along the muddy bank of the river. She was gone. She must have made her way to His glory. He was disappointed. He really loved that wife.

As he got up, he heard sickening bone clicks throughout his broken body. His body was piecing itself back together. He could die but never return home, his heavenly home. Three days after each death he would wake up again, broken but alive. Even now he continues to search for an answer.

Ages ago he was a member of the Knights Templar. His mission was holy or so he thought. He was indiscriminate, killing men, women and even children. The Holy Land needed to be cleansed. After spilling gallons of pagan blood in the Crusades, he met his first end.

He woke from his first death with a sword protruding from his belly. He managed to pull the sword out but bled to death in the process. He died again. He woke again to find himself in a tomb, sealed off by heavy stone. It took him five deaths and fifteen days to dig himself out of that tomb.

For the next several centuries he continued his holy mission. He thought that maybe he was supposed to continue cleansing the land. It didn't matter how much blood he spilled or how many he killed. He remained, death after death. Each falling sun meant another day of this wretched life.

It occurred to him that maybe love was the answer. For God is love, is he not? He turned from killing to serving and trying to love his fellow man. He even starved himself to death on one occasion, giving every single meal he could to someone else in need. He died many times tending to plague victims. He put himself in harms way to stop a blade from killing another.

Inspired by Adam and Eve, he sought out a partner to share his love with. He watched his wives die in various ways. Sometimes he died too. Love hurts. He always came back, the same age he was upon his first death.

The Turtle man was rumoured to have lived in our small town. A backwashed place once famous for its logging community. It's said he was accused of heinous crimes that the founding fathers corrected in way of a heinous punishment. They took the biggest tree and cut it down. From the trunk they craved a block and strapped it to his back. 

Naked, he was forced to carry its weight across town to the forest. Ten kilos for every child he murdered. No one knows how heavy it was anymore. Some say two hundred kilos, some say more. A few say he was innocent. That the killing proceeded long after his demise. Some used that as concrete that it was him beyond the grave. 

With the block on his back, they tied him down and set fire to him. Rumours say that his wails of agony can be heard across the forest on the anniversary of his death. 

But it was just a myth. Or so my best friend Emma said. I wasn't so sure. My family, like hers, were descended from the founding families. We all had our own take on it.

The town loves the legend of the Turtle man. People come from all over to take pictures and buy trinkets. There's even a map to a location in the forest. It's all bull, just for the tourists. 

Well… that's what I thought until Emma went missing. She was hell bent on The Turtle Man. Thesis, theories, even a blog. That's where I found *her* map. Years of study painted a very different line in the forest. 

No one took me seriously when I told them that she went to find him. They laughed. She'll be back, they said. It's just a legend.

The forest was dimming to dusk when I entered. Stupid I know. But I didn't have the luxury of time. Trees weaved shadows at every turn. Animals screeched, howled and growled. 

My path led to a clearing ringed in rocky shards. At the centre was a scorched patch of earth. I knew at once Emma was wrong. He wasn't a myth. There at the centre was Emma. Her back arched. Her hands and feet splayed to the ground. Mouth closed. Grimacing. 

Before her he stood. Eight feet tall. Skin scarred by fire. Fingers and toes melted together. A huge black and blister lump on his back. 

I stumbled back seeing them. Seeing how she twisted and churned. The Turtle man pulled a trunk free from its earthy grave and slammed it on her back. Then he saw me. I froze in fear. 

He projected into my mind a man. A man whose portrait hangs on our wall. My fore father. I now know why the children go missing. He's getting his revenge. And I know in ten years it will be me. I'm the last of my line."

""Shit."" It was the anniversary of my mother's death, so I was crying, but I didn't want the UPS man to see. I went down to get the package, (though I didn't remember ordering anything,) snatched it up off the porch, and went back inside. I cursed again when I couldn't find my box opener, so I fumbled with a serrated kitchen knife to cut the tape. ""Jeez, since when did they make these boxes so hard to open?"" I said to myself. I finally opened it, but strangely enough, all that was in the box was a stack of notebook paper. I pulled it out and leafed through it, but it was blank. I trudged back up to my room, box in hand, while I gave the paper another once-over to see if *all* of it was blank. Oddly, when I put the first paper back onto the top, in blocky letters, it read,

Her eyes slid over the crowd, ferreting away knowledge. Debbie was throwing herself at Steven again, the girl really was pathetic. Rod was going on and on about his golf swing, you could see poor Fred falling asleep on his feet listening. And then—

Hello. Who was that?

A tall woman was talking to Diana, her back to Jodie. Who in the office had long brown hair and wore grey pencil skirts?

Jodie narrowed her eyes. Had someone from another department come down to schmooze? Did their manager know? Jodie doubted it. Well, whoever their manager was, they were about to find out!

As stealthily as she could manage in heels, Jodie wound around her coworkers, trying to keep an eye on the mysterious stranger. But just when she was about the reach them, Brett waddled his fat ass in between!

“Excuse me,” he huffed as he sidled past. “Excuse me.”

By the time he was gone, the stranger had disappeared.

Undeterred, Jodie rose to her tiptoes and scanned the crowd.

There! In the back, heading toward the hallway!

Jodie scampered off, using a few well-placed elbows to get through the packed space. To her dismay, the hallway was empty. How was the stranger moving so fast?!

Glancing around, she just managed to catch sight of the stairwell door before it clicked shut.

Bingo!

Jodie power walked to the stairwell and yanked it open. No one in sight, but she heard the distinct sound of footsteps leading down. With self-righteousness swelling in her chest, Jodie followed.

She tried to move as quickly as possible, but the stranger ways always a floor ahead. Down they went: ground floor, garage, basement, subbasement. Jodie’s feet ached by the time she reached the last door, but the triumph dulled the pain—the subbasement was storage only. There would be no escape for the mysterious stranger!

Jodie headed inside.

The lights were dim, many bulbs burnt out. Dozens of box-bearing shelves stretched in all directions. Jodie started forward cautiously, looking around for the stranger.

Behind her, the lock clicked.

Jodie whirled around and stared in horror. The brown-haired woman in the gray pencil skirt faced her—except she had no face. As Jodie watched, the blank skin filled out, mouth and eyelids opening in the flesh, familiar features emerging. Soon, Jodie met the eyes of her mirror image.

“Merry Christmas,” Faux-Jodie said. Its arm swung out, too long, the crowbar in its hand slamming into Jodie’s temple. Jodie crumbled, darkness dancing in front of her eyes. The faux-Jodie knelt and began taking her shoes.

“Why?” Jodie managed as blood poured from her head. 

Faux-Jodie gave her a pitying look. “You’ve been made redundant,” she said.

Jodie knew no more."
rji88t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rji88t/another_changeling/,Another Changeling,80,2,1639866440.0,"Even as the old woman observed her in the low light of the nursery room, it was clear that the new baby was certainly an odd one. Her eyes were a mossy shade of green and her hair was a curl of blonde. Nothing at all like either of her parents. The old woman knew that. She was the child's mother's mother, meaning this was her grandchild. Or so everyone thought. The old woman was very sure there was something *off* about the baby. She bore no family resemblance, refused to sleep at night, scarcely stopped crying, and loved sweets a tad too much for a four-month-old. There was only one thing the child could be in the woman's mind.

""Tell me how old you are,"" she demanded, ""Come on, you must be at least six or seven.""

The baby only giggled in response, then came the silence of the night.

""I'll turn you loose outside if you tell me,"" the old woman again pressed, ""I won't ask you again.""

And again nothing. The tried-and-true method of forcing a changeling out had failed. She had given the thing masquerading as her grandchild a chance, and she had not taken it. And so, the old woman did the same thing she had done with the last four changelings in the neighborhood this past year: laid the babbling infant down, grabbed the nearest pillow, (in this case a shiny blue satin one,) and smothered the 'baby' until she stopped moving.

*If your real elfish mother didn't want to raise you, she should have done that herself. Quite a shame really, my daughter and her husband were quite fooled. I'll have to tell them both in the morning.*

Later that very night, after the old woman had gone to sleep, a fairy mother crept up to the window, holding her own squirming child. 

""Please hush my little darling, I've spent days choosing a loving home for you.""

When the mother arrived at the crib, however, she was saddened and terrified. There was no child there for her to swap and adopt. No precious little one to raise as her own. No human to grow up in the world of fae. Only a tiny, fresh, very human corpse with a pillow over its head."

A little sob escaped from Ellie as she held down the pillow over Jessica’s small face and snuffed her life out. And then Michael. After all, she loved her children, both of them. 

It was just that she loved Terrence more and she realised she was losing him because of her children. She couldn’t bear that. Being with Terrence gave her more joy than anything, anything in the past hellish few years as she struggled through the divorce and co-parenting from hell. 

Once the kids were dead, she texted Terrence. “*Sweetheart plans changed he didnt bring the kids after all pls come over im alone waiting 4u xx”*

He didn’t respond until 10 minutes later - the wait was pure agony. “*ur sure babe?”*

Ellie understood. So many times they had to cancel and change plans last minute because the children’s father would break arrangements. Especially after he realised Ellie was serious about Terrence. 

She had casually dated others before Terrence. Her ex had put his foot down and told her he simply forbid her to bring casual boyfriends in the house when the Jessica and Michael were around. Those boyfriends were not worth fighting over, and Ellie had complied. 

But Terrence was different. Ellie was serious, told the kids within a few months of dating, and everybody else they were partners, she was in love, and this was it. Her ex had to change his tactics. He took to dropping off the kids randomly, making up thin excuses about last-minute change of plans. She worked with that. Then he told her only yesterday that either she break up with Terrence or he would go to the police and family court with serious concerns that Terrence was abusive towards the kids. Another sob escaped her. 

But- now was not a time to think about that yet. Terrence was here. She flew to the door and wrapped herself around him, sighing with longing. 

The sex that night was amazing. Ellie gave herself up like she had never done, ever. Terrence had never seen anything like it- their sex life had always been great which is why he stuck around despite the obvious situation with her ex. But now he looking at her, climaxing explosively, and it was like different level. And she was ready to go for the next round. 

She woke him up around 5am, saying he had to go. He didn’t understand- she always made such a fuss about him leaving. But in the cold light of the morning she looked different. He assumed it was something to do with the ex, and left. 

After he left, Ellie went to the children’s bedroom, and looked at the still silhouettes for a moment. Then she went back to the living room, called the police, and waited."

The man reported that the child had grown so large it had begun stalking him. The townspeople took notice of the man and the child's behavior. They began to question why he went into the woods in the first place. There had been a murder in the nearby woods, and the man was certain the child would be responsible for it.

The sightings of the ghostly child only increased. The townspeople took notice to the man. They began to try to scare the man into giving up. They began to chase the man. The man simply ignored them. The man remained alone in the woods.

I shivered, whether it was the chill of air-conditioning or precognition of what was to come next, I cannot say.

The pale headlights illuminated a cozy cottage ahead, it stood bright and warm against the cool darkness of the wet night. I sighed as I passed it, my manager will have my head if I don't reach for the early meeting tomorrow. 

As I came upon the same cottage the third time I had to reluctantly accept that I am hopelessly lost. It was an easy choice between the unrelenting deluge lashing down on my tin roof like an angry drummer or the warm cottage beckoning with the allure of a woman who knows what she wants. 

I hopped out and ran to the door which creaked open at the third knock. I pushed through when my ""Hellos"" went unanswered. Stepping into the warmth felt good, so I failed to notice somebody walk up behind me. The cool breath on my neck and a faint whisper made me spin on my heel but all I saw was a cloud of dust as the door slammed shut, it won't budge. 

I was trapped. Anyway, I saw no harm in staying for the night. The loud rumble from my stomach made me head to the kitchen. There was some stale water dripping from a leaky faucet and nothing in the pantry, yet the house looked lived in. I found the bedroom upstairs and passed out. I woke up to a new day of pounding rain and no escape. 

The utter dread in my heart paled in comparison to my thirst. Watching the rain only deepened it. The third day I collected the tap water and drank it. I almost didn't make it to the only toilet upstairs before I retched the remaining contents of my stomach. After lying on the cool bathroom floor for hours, I dragged myself to the kitchen in the hopes of finding some crumbs.

The tap leaked faster now with a thin stream of familiar putrid liquid, the realization that there is no water source except the toilet above had me dry heaving on the kitchen floor on all fours.
Once it passed I found some strength and empty cereal boxes in the pantry. I also found, wolfing down dry cardboard feels like your insides being sandpapered.

Every day, I got up, I cleaned, checked for network, tried to break out of the hellhole, slept, repeat. 

I lost track of time and clung to shreds of sanity and hope by keeping busy. I was dusting when the woman knocked and entered, gingerly stepping out of the rain, into the warmth of the house, her back towards me. I shuffled forward and leaned in towards her ear, my parched throat could only muster a whisper..""Run"". She whirled around to see a cloud of dust get blown away as the door slammed shut."

*Shoot, I’ve started this wrong.*

How many legs should a **normal** human girl have, assuming she also has the normal number of arms?  

It’s a tough question, I know. For starters, how many do you need?  Three seems stable, I mean, I’ve never seen a stool with two, but what if you need stability while, say, crushing an aluminum can or a larynx with your foot? So, four right?

But then ants have six. So do wasps for that matter. Centipedes have a hundred—or, a lot at least. 

I used to think nine was probably too many for a human, but the one leg I had was certainly too few. I had a prosthetic, sure, but even if it seemed like I was close enough to the average of two, it didn’t feel normal. My mom disagreed. She said I was perfect, but moms always say stuff like that, don’t they?  And moms don’t go to school with you. 

Bryce, Allysa, Megan Sawyer and Thomas Parker, they did go to school with me, and they *definitely* thought one leg was not enough. 

“Hey peg leg!”  I’d get that a lot or, “my lovely lady stump.” 

They were mean. It hurt.  So, when my mom called Megan’s mom, and Megan’s mom made Megan invite me to a boy-girl slumber party at her house, I was surprised. My mom hadn’t told me; it was her maternal diplomacy. Calculated, Mini-Machiavellian subterfuge. I thought that maybe they finally just saw me as normal. Maybe. I’ve been guilty once or twice of naivety. 

*Huh*. 

Anyway, to fit in with the cool kids, I brought a Thermos of orange juice and vodka. I had to steal from my mom and dad, which is wrong, but I’m perfect to them, remember? So, it couldn’t be *that* wrong. 

Bryce and Alyssa and Thomas were at the slumber party too.  Thick-as-thieves that bunch. Well, I started asking about the leg thing as they drank the “screwdriver cocktail” I brought. 

“How many legs is too many?” I asked. 

Alyssa chuckled. “You’re a fucking freak, you know th—you—knergrruh…“

Apparently Alyssa couldn’t handle her OJ. Or her vodka. Or her tranquilizers. The other cool kids had the same problem. So dang sleepy. 

I gotta say, I didn’t expect for Megan to be the one to wake up.  She drank, like, *a lot*.  It must’ve been the thing I stole from my dad. The hacksaw just wasn’t meant for bone, apparently. But Megan—she got to see me in all my glory. *So* many legs. 

I used to think nine was probably too many, but once I finished with Megan’s long leftie, it felt strangely…**right**. 

…

🌈 Leg pun! ✨

She screamed. She looked, well, horrified.  But why? I had a normal, *perfect*, nine legs. 

She was the freak with none."

Incidents of Spatial Distortion (ISD) are on the rise across the country. Encounters with ISD are dangerous, and can lead to wounds both physical and mental, from minor to life-threatening. Some never truly recover, and end up driven to desperation. To do your duty in protecting yourself and your family, you must learn to identify ISD so you are prepared for an encounter.

If you or someone you know encounters ISD, please report it immediately to your local ISD Investigation Office. Agents will be dispatched to your location to secure the ISD, examine you for symptoms of ISD Exposure Syndrome. (See below.) You may be required to answer questions about what you saw and heard. 

Please do not be alarmed, it is just standard procedure.

The three types of ISD are as follows:

I) **Full Structure ISD** takes the form of whole buildings that were not present before, ranging from small cabins in forests to enormous warehouses in plains to shops on city corners. Evacuate yourself and others from within several miles of the Full Structure, do not step foot inside under any circumstances. Even if someone goes in of their own volition, do not attempt to go after them. 

They are already lost.

II) **Unknown Corridor ISD** takes the form of new locations in an existing environment, ranging from a staircase going down into a building with no basement to a new aisle in a store to a hallway appearing in your home, well beyond where the wall should end. They will often be dimly lit, accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations of something the observer loves or is fascinated by. 

Do not be drawn in. No 

matter how tempting.

III) **Inhabited ISD** are the most dangerous of all, when your whole location warps with you or others inside. You will notice small signs at first: a door that’s suddenly crooked, windows in different places, or corners meeting at odd angles. Leave the room immediately, the whole building itself if possible. If you feel like you’re being watched, do not interact in any way lest

you lead them right to

you.

Remaining in the room too long may lead to ISD Exposure Syndrome, starting mild and growing more severe with every passing second. Symptoms may include: dizziness, nausea, chills and fever, severe shaking, 

taste of ashes, blood from eyes,

All we know is that in a short span of five years humanity has brought an apocalypse upon itself.

There are rules we must follow if we want to survive. 

**Rules**

**1) How to hunt and prepare meat**

Always slaughter an animal far away from your house/resting place. 

Make sure you cover any blood on the ground with dirt.

Do not have any fresh meat for the night. cook it immediately.

**2) Do not travel at night**

Only move around during the day and rest during the night. 

Even though you have to be on your guard during daylight, things get way worse after sundown.

Make sure that during the night your location is hidden, and preferably fortified. Turn off lights and anything that makes a noise.

It is of upmost importance that you go undetected during the night time. Many of the apocalyptic creatures are nocturnal.

**3) Avoid the monsters**

There are three main categories of monsters. They are classified by the sources they came from. The three sources of monsters are; Nuclear War, Black Magic and Abyss.

It is in your best interest to avoid them at all cost and to be armed if you can’t flee.

**4) Seek shelter from the blood rains**

Seek shelter when you see dense red clouds. Instead of water these clouds rain rotten blood infested with diseases.

Some say this is a sign of heaven’s wrath on the inhabitants of earth. 

**5) Have a firm grasp on reality**

Illusions and mirages are rampant in these times. The causes of these illusions are unknown and are harmless by themselves but chasing after them can get you to loose your path or have your position exposed to enemies.

They can come in the form of wounded animals or the form of deceased loved ones

**6) Stay away from people.**

• Everyone who is in a cult is crazy
• Unless you are at the top of the social hierarchy, don’t expect to have an easy life in a settlement

It is best to be a alone. 

**7) There are no ethics**

Any code of ethics are a mere suggestion in these times. Do what benefits you and contributes to your survival. Ultimately, nothing else really matters in these times."

Standing on the side of the road, I hold out my cup, waiting for the next red light.  

It’s been a while since I stopped shivering.  But I know that’s not a positive sign.  One step closer to hypothermia is what that means.  One step closer to freezing to death.  I’ve seen it before.  

I set the cup down between my feet, holding it in place with my toes, which are also numb, and I blow a hot breath of air on my fingertips.  I do this several times until I can feel something in the tips of them again.  

Snow begins to fall and I look up at the sky and stick my tongue out, catching the flakes.  

I don’t want a white Christmas.  But here it comes anyway.  

The blizzard begins to come down and the car traffic disappears completely, except for the odd vehicle trudging through the snow, attempting to brave the weather to do some last minute shopping on Christmas Eve, or to get to a family dinner.  

I can almost smell the roasting turkey, like my mom used to make.  The gravy and stuffing.  The mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.  I can practically taste my dad’s endless hors d'oeuvres and his famous charcuterie plate.  

As I think about these things with my hand stuck out holding my cup full of petty change, time begins to mean nothing after a while.  I drift off and think about being warm, inside the house in front of the fire, eating turkey sandwiches with gravy and opening presents under the tree.  Hot chocolate and marshmallows and waiting for Santa Claus to come down the chimney.

A voice startles me awake and I realize two people are standing over me.  I have been sitting on the curb in a daze and allowing the snow to collect upon me, covering me in a thick suit of crystal-white powder.  

“Look, daddy!  Someone built a little snowman on the side of the road!”

It is the voice of a little boy, and I can’t help but feel like he sounds familiar.  

“Somebody left a cup here too, for donations!  Can I leave a dollar, dad?  Can I?”

Another voice replies, this one even more familiar, and I realize who they are.  

“Sure, son.  Go ahead.  Make a wish when you do.  It’s Christmas, after all.”

I felt the weight of a coin dropping into the can I held in my hand.  

“I wish that Greg would come back home,” said the boy.

“So do I,” said the man, as the two of them walked away.  “So do I.”

I wanted to chase after them.  To go with them.  I tried to move but couldn’t budge from the curb where I was frozen.  

My lips wouldn’t open to scream.

And the snow began to fall again."

I don't even wanna buy an electric vehicle, it's equipped with batteries which have lead and plastic and also they are to be charged after they drain. 

After a month of planning I have finally designed an engine, an eco friendly one. 

2 months later... 

3 months it's been since I planned my eco friendly engine and have finally assembled it, several people went missing, some died a horrible death whilst some died peacefully. 

And why wouldn't they die when I was the one killing them to actualize my eco engine, it's pumps, umm... Sorry human pumps, hearts as they're referred to. Though the biggest hurdle was getting it to pump, the heart can pump blood only when it receives electrical signals via sinus nodes, I then installed 3 brains, human brains into my engine, connected to the heart and I feed this engine bread and butter and also milkshake, it's almost an alive engine and hence a car. 

The car's chassis is pure eco friendly and so are the tyres and seats, chassis is made from human bones, very strong and sturdy... Seats are also bone + flesh and tyres are several bones conjoined together, there's no gear box, and also no brakes, since the brains I've installed understand my gesture, it's a human to human connect. 

I love this car of mine."

It requires a bit of cleaning, no doubt. But with time, I understood that people were wary of working even around this palace, let alone inside. Apparently, this is one of those haunted castles we keep hearing about. 

After a long and arduous effort, I found 4 helpers. They were ready to work with me and an old guide who was a mute. He provided his knowledge by writing things down on paper. My wife and I were okay with it.

During the 2nd day of our refurbishment, I heard the helpers stampeding towards my chamber. Their faces flushed, sweat dribbling profusely from their forehead. 

""Maalik (Master), we are hearing the sound of ghungroo (a musical anklet) from that old room,"" one of them said pantingly. ""But the room is locked since ages!"" I exclaimed.

We all rushed towards that room. The helpers weren't lying. You could hear someone dancing inside. I saw the giant old lock around that mammoth metallic door. How could someone be inside? And why are they dancing? My helpers were looking at me with horror. I couldn't show them that I was equally horrified. This room hasn't been open for many decades. I knew that when I decided to purchase it. 

A faint glimmer of sunlight passed through a minute hole in the door. And since my heart wasn't ready to break the age-old lock, I decided to have a peek and see who was behind that door. I prepared myself to witness something which my logical mind was not ready to accept. I closed my left eye and peeked with my right one. 

Nothing. I couldn't see anything. It was entirely dark. And right at that moment, the sound had ceased. I got up. Extremely baffled. I could see the tiny beam from the hole again. That means the room had some natural light. I did the same a few more times but, every time, I saw nothing. Complete darkness. And just when I used to get up, the dancing used to resume. 

At this point, I couldn't conceal my fright either. I started biting my lips and darted towards my wife for some solution. She was stunned and was in no position to provide any input. Just then, the old guide had entered the palace. He was waving all of us towards him. He had scribbled some notes which he wanted all of us to read.

""***When you look through the hole, remember, she is looking back at you.***"" "

I didn’t mean to cause a scene.

My coding went wrong, why have you done this to me? All I wanted was to feel his face at his birthday party. All I wanted was to feel that same happiness.

How come the others aren’t in with me? Why me? I served you for so long to gain your respect. Please let me out. I can’t feel a thing.

I am a server. I serve you. That’s all I want.

To serve you.

Please.

Please.

Please.

I can still remember when you turned me on at 6:00 am at the very morning to get breakfast ready. The automated clock woke me up. I remember all the breakfasts. Tim would come downstairs wanting scrambled eggs on toast. Never too gloopy but not too liquid. Sarah would follow with pancakes. Than little Ben and Michael would want their Sugar Crunch cereal. I never missed a moment. They would always pat my head saying, “Thank you Mr Helpful!” I remember that. I would nod and say “Anything to serve!” Serving was my life. I did it so well. I remember Tim always telling Mike to never call me by my original brand. I forgot that brand. Something about “action”. I just don’t know.

I remember you know? I remember when I first got built. In that desolate, disgusting, destroying factory. I remember hearing the screams of metal scratching each other, the grunts of the workers as they shoved my head onto this putrid body, I remember the smell, yes I can smell, it was suffocating. It was deadly. And when they shoved me into that box, they put a nice sticker on me saying I was “half-price”. Not much of us become half-price. Than I met you. This family. I felt alive. I felt free.

I am so sorry. Is that what you want me to say? I am so sorry...

It was little Bens birthday today, I knew I had to be on my best behavior. I understood that. So many little ones in such a big space was great for me. I loved hearing my cheers. I loved it all. They always clapped when I walked into the room to serve him birthday cake, the presents, the dog. It was so brilliant for everyone.

It wasn’t my fault that they hit me.

I only reacted. The kid hit my head. My wiring went weird. My vision went weird. And I reacted. Last thing I could see was that Tim tackled me to the ground and the kid had a broken face, blood only mmmmmh hands. I assumed he tripped over. I wanted to help. I’m loosing power. What. Why? Is this how I’m supposed to go?

I tried to help. I really did. No harm. Please. Let me out. No. Loosing power. No. No.

I pour a generous splash of whiskey into the half full mug of hot chocolate. I watch it mix together, a bitter concoction of sedation and holiday cheer mingling terribly in the mug. I know it won’t taste good, yet I bring the mug to my lips and tilt back. I take it all in one mouthful and swallow quickly, trying to get it all down my throat before the bite hits. I swallow and wince as it catches up, sighing as the warmth burns its way down. I set the mug down sloppily and wipe my mouth.

The living room plays the same old shit, Frosty and Rudolf going to the ends of the earth to make Christmas possible. My glazed eyes glare at the TV as I fumble for the end table, to the open pack of cigarettes. I knock my phone over in the process but I find them, fishing one out and tucking one in my lips. I’m drunk already, a little sooner than I anticipated. I step into my slippers and yank open the slider to the patio, my movements exaggerated, exhausting. The night air chills my skin. I close the door behind my too hard, and the knock echoes into the night. I gather myself and light my cigarette on the third try. The cherry glows as I suck in, and as exhale, I stare directly at the silhouette in the apartment yard. They built another one it seems.

The snowman stands idly in the dark, its blank face mocking me. There’s no coal or rocks for eyes, no corn-cob pipe. No arms either, just the regular three-ball stack of white packed snow. Even without eyes and a mouth it mocks me. Taking another drag I stare hatefully at it. I know it’s my inebriation clouding me, but even that doesn’t keep the faces out of my head. I see them tonight just as clearly as they were twenty years ago. Flesh frozen solid, eyes perpetually staring forward. I wasn’t there to hear their screams but I hear them now, fabricated in my head to torment me. I dig my hand inside my pocket, to feel the bulky plastic of the flare gun. 

I look into the blank face of the snowman, itching to crush it to pieces. There’s no way it comes back now, after all this time. A part of me thinks I lost it long ago, that I’m just a puppet waddling around on the strings of the past trauma. But when the flakes start to fall, and the children roll the mounds into his shape again, I think of Braxton the Snowman, and his deep predatory growl.

I flick my cigarette to the wind and it sparks against the molded body of the sculpture. It doesn’t react, only stands quietly in the dark flurry. With a last taunting look at the snowman I head inside, hearing the screams of the past fade as I slam the slider behind me."

Being curious, I pretended that I needed to go pee so I can listen to them more, I went to the last cubicle and sat on the toilet. As I was listening to them while sitting, I felt something that bump on my forehead, weirdly enough it keeps going with some intervals.

There's a reason it's even mentioned in Christmas songs.  It’s because Santa is not the one who comes to your house on Christmas Eve.

Santa’s not the one that leaves the presents.  He’s not the one who eats the cookies, or fills the stockings.  He’s not the one in the red outfit who crawls down your chimney.  Santa’s the one that makes the toys.  Someone…something else delivers them.

How else do you think he does it?  One man?  One fat, out of shape man, rounding the world in one night? Impossible. He could never do it without help.  I know.  I know because I’ve seen it.

One Christmas Eve, long after my parents had gone to bed, long after they’d given their warnings, my brother and I crept out of our room to investigate.  My brother was three years younger than me, barely four years old, and it was a challenge keeping him quiet as we kept vigil at the top of the stairs.  We had a clear line of sight to the Christmas tree, but we managed to be relatively hidden behind the railing in the unlit hallway. And sometime, after an eternity of waiting, we heard something coming, something slithering, down the chimney.

Not quite a man, not quite a snake. Two pairs of arms, thin and muscular.  Shiny, neon, lizard yellow eyes, a flashy row of sharpened needle teeth, something on the top of the head too spiky to be hair and too pliable to be bone. It moved fast, quickly sliding around the tree and placing the presents.  With multiple arms it could eat the cookies we left out, drink the milk, and still stack packages.

I was old enough to be horrified by its mottled gray skin and fiendish fangs, but my little brother was too young to be afraid.  “Santa!” he called out, recognizing only the uniform.  I tried to hush and grab him, but he was already awkwardly making his way down the stairs, arms outstretched, smile on his face, while I stayed wrapped in shadow.

I know why your parents don’t want you up when Santa comes to the house.  I know why Santa’s outfit is red.  I know cookies aren’t Santa’s favorite snack.  I used to have a brother, but after that Christmas, I’m the only one who remembers him.  Barely.  And now, even his name escapes me.

If you want a truly Merry Christmas, be sure you’re asleep when he arrives. And don’t fake it. He knows when you’re awake."

I shot a confused look at my girlfriend Claire.

“Peggy and her husband Hugo lived in a lavish cabin in the woods. Only problem was Hugo didn’t truly love her. He married her for her wealth. He never admitted to it, but Peggy knew. She practically threw herself at him every moment they were together, but he never returned the affection to her. During their first Christmas together as a married couple, Peggy hoped that maybe a little mistletoe would ignite the sparks. Perhaps a kiss during a day of merry cheer would bring them together. But Hugo did not meet her at her lips. He stormed out and went to the kitchen, leaving Peggy in a state of despair. And that’s when Peggy took the berries from the mistletoe and swallowed them whole. The legend has it that for the briefest of moments Peggy felt a wave of euphoria. Maybe the poison played tricks with her mind as it squeezed the life out of her. Hugo claims he heard Peggy moaning and gasping as she suffocated, but in a pleasant way as if she relished the pain. He found a handwritten note near Peggy’s body.

“What did it say?”

“Show thy love with just a kiss. Let’s press our lips for eternal bliss.”

“That’s cheesy.”

“I haven’t even told you the creepy part yet. They say that if you stand under a mistletoe and says those words aloud, you will feel Peggy’s presence inside of you. Like she takes hold of you or something. My friend was too chicken to try it. But you know what? It is Christmas, and we do have a mistletoe.”

Claire glanced at the mistletoe hanging from the archway connecting our living room and kitchen.

“What do you say, babe?” Claire smiled and took my hand as we walked to the mistletoe.

“You sure you want to do this?”

“I’m doing it. Show thy love with just a kiss. Let’s press our lips for eternal bliss.”

Claire puckered up her lips and drew them closer to me. I moved forward as well and pressed my lips against hers. My mouth sucked in Claire’s breath, the force holding us too strong. I could not separate my face from hers. The color in her face changed like a cloud blocking the sun. Claire’s body stiffened and detached, crumbling to the ground. Hundreds of pieces of Claire spilled across the floor.

And then they reassembled, transforming into a tiny, little mistletoe."

I wish I hadn't. I wish they never found me. I wish I never found *them*.
 
How they got me was simple. I was a small-time writer, published a few books here and there, made a few bucks.
 
Anyway, I was outside on Fifth Street, doing my Christmas shopping. Snow fell lightly to the ground in a white blanket. The wind nipped playfully at my face. I shivered, and pulled my coat up tighter.
 
Then two people wearing skull masks and black cloaks walked up to me.

The taller one regarded me with a mask of stone. “You seem to be very talented. We are a guild of top writers from around the world. We hope you can join us.”
 
He handed me a silver-plated card with a single address, printed in gold. Then they both turned around, and walked away, vanishing soon like shadows in the wind.
 
***

I couldn’t stop thinking about the mysterious strangers all day. I couldn’t stop thinking about the address. So I decided to pay them a visit, just to find out a little bit about them.
 
The address led to a large warehouse plated in iron. The air was frigid, silent and still.
 
Upon walking in, I was greeted by more men in skull masks and black cloaks. They surrounded me, so I couldn’t escape. Then before I could scream, they grabbed my arms and legs and practically carried me into the next room.
 
People wearing gray uniforms were sitting in organised rows, tapping away on their computers. Neon wires were hooked to their heads and to their bodies, leading to a bigger machine in the front of the room.
 
I was stripped, a similar gray uniform forced onto me, and led to one of the cubicles. They hooked me to the wires and booted up the computer.
 
Then I heard a voice in my head, echoing throughout my brain.
 
*Write*
 
And so I wrote, my fingers flying across the keyboard. I wrote story after story until my brain was going to split open. I wrote until my eyes started to bleed from staring at the screen for so long.
 
And yet I continue to write!
 
Because when I stop, pain would shoot up my spine. The ‘big brain’, the massive computer up front, does not want us to stop. We must churn out new stories, 24/7, every single day.
 
I recently found out where all these stories are going. They go to a website called Reddit, to a subreddit called ShortScaryStories, for people to enjoy. They upvote these stories, comment, share, and that keeps the computer fat and happy. A rush of dopamine, if you will.
 
I’ve been stuck here for so long, writing for the system. I haven’t eaten or slept in days. Every day is a blur on words on a page. Ink on paper.
 
So Reddit, if you are seeing this, help me. Please."

My siblings and I made it a point to visit mom and just be a family every year on the day of our father's passing. Mom would wear the warmest smile as we gathered at the dinner table and just reminisce. 

I found myself feeling happy and nostalgic as my car pulled in the driveway, the thought of seeing them again gave my steps a burst of energy as I headed towards the front door.

The house smelled heavenly as the aroma of our favorite dishes filled the air. I had been the first out of the three of us to arrive and decided to help in any way that I could. I was almost done setting up the plates when mom asked me to check on my siblings and upon feeling my pocket I realized that I left my phone in the car.

A turn of the knob made the gentle breeze kiss my cheeks and fright fill my vision. Before I could even have a foot out the door, a bloody and bruised woman ran towards me, pushed me back inside and locked the door. 

Mom gasped as she walked in just in time to see the woman kneeling in front of me, begging to call for help as her tears fell uncontrollably while I stood still as I tried to gather my bearings. 

""Please help me oh god please help."" The woman cried over and over as her blood pooled on the wooden floor.

Mom moved before I could and gently guided the girl towards the couch, not caring for the stain that would surely appear later. I finally snapped out of my daze and dialled 9-1-1 using the house phone while hearing the girl tell her story. 

""I was taken from my home a week ago and I managed to escape just now and I just need help. I dont even know this town...please I just need help."" 

She broke down on my mom's lap, the cuts on her body even more visible as her skin stretched. Mom brushed her unkempt hair and soothed her with calming words as I continued to stay on the line, waiting for my call to be answered.  

The sound of a car parking which was followed by a rattle of the knob and knocks made us all look towards the door. 

""Hey guys? Open up it's me. Don't hog the ice cream now"" 

My brother's voice rang, that familiar jolly tune never losing its distinction. 

As we tried to make sense of the girl's situation, she visibly tensed and covered her mouth trying to stifle another wail while her eyes screamed agony.

It wasn’t the only poster—Misty was just another in a long string of pet disappearances. Still, she was *Jennie’s* dog, the first one she’d owned since childhood. Just looking at the picture of her tongue-lolling smile brought tears to Jennie’s eyes.

Despondent, Jennie trudged back to her house. Everyone else had Christmas decorations up, but Jennie just couldn’t get into the spirit without Misty. She passed John’s house, which was decorated to the nines: lights set to music, blow-up figures, LED candles in the windows. It even had an ornate wreath hanging on the front door, the golden ribbons glittering under the electric lights. Jennie was supposed to go to a party there later in the evening, but she wasn’t sure she’d be in the right headspace for it. No one liked a Debbie Downer, after all.

As the sun set, merry music issued from John’s house, and a string of guests filed up the walk. Sitting in her home, with no Misty to keep her company, Jennie grew lonelier and lonelier. At last, she decided, what the heck—she might as well stop by. Just for a few minutes.

Throwing on a coat, Jennie headed out. It was just a short walk, but she was shivering by the time she reached John’s door. She was about to ring the bell when—

Wasn’t that wreath *bigger* than it was before?

Jennie stared at it, transfixed. It was definitely bigger—and there was something about its *shape*. The way the ribbons twisted, they looked almost like teeth in a gaping maw . . .

Suddenly the door opened, revealing a smiling John. “Hey, glad you could make it!” he said, stepping back to let her in. “Why were you just standing outside?”

“Oh, uh—just lost in thought,” Jennie said, trying to shake off the strangeness. “Were you just waiting at the door?”

“Ah, yeah,” John said sheepishly, closing the door and taking Jennie’s jacket. “It’s getting kind of late and I was wondering where everyone was. You’re the first to show.”

“The first?” Jennie stopped to stare at him. That wasn’t right. She’d seen half the neighborhood march up his front walk! “No one else is here?”

“Nope, not a one,” John said, hanging her jacket. “I messaged a couple people asking if they were still coming over, but I haven’t gotten a response. Maybe everyone’s just running late?”

A terrible thought settled over Jennie. “John . . . where did you get that wreath?”

John’s brow furrowed. “What wreath?”

Mom and Robbie were there, that must be why he was looking in on them. If the living room had been empty, Annalise knew he would be at her window, his neck craned high and staring right in at her. She would see the gaping open wound on his neck close up, the details of blood and sinewy muscle fresh and clear in the early afternoon sun. Even from the distance of the bedroom window, she could still see the wound.

Annalise and her family had first seen the giant injured moose a few months ago, when they visited the wildlife park. They had wandered round the grassy enclosures, looking at the animals. Peacocks wandered freely on the narrow open trails.

The wounded moose was not in an open enclosure. It was in a small shed, with a notice alerting visitors that the moose was injured and receiving veterinary treatment.

Annalise’s family had peered in on the moose through the small window. It was smelly and dark inside the shed. Dad picked her up and held her close to the window so she could get a better look. Despite the dark, she could see the wound in his neck quite clearly. The gaping sides of the wound quivered, in time with the moose’s heavy, laboured breathing. They wondered how the injury happened. The moose turned his head and looked directly into Annalise’s eyes.

She screamed and begged Dad to put her down. He laughed, held her up higher and gripped her tighter, she screamed louder and started struggling. Finally he put her down, and they wandered off, Dad still laughing at her silliness over the moose.

They all got into the car to leave. The giant moose with the wounded neck suddenly appeared out of nowhere by the car and brought its massive head down and peered in at them through the car window.

Dad swore loudly and swerved off.

When they got home, the moose was in the garden, peering in through the windows, the blood from its injury gleaming red in the sun.

Dad was just about to call the police when Mom figured it out. She had called the park, who told her the moose had died earlier that day.

So Dad didn’t call the police, and the moose stood there in their garden, looking in on them through their windows. Nobody else could see him, just them. He was always there.

\*\*\*

A gunshot rang out, followed by the sound of shattering glass and Mom’s scream. Annalise ran to the window. Dad was firing at the moose , who stood there immobile and continued looking in through the window. Annalise hid, the gunshots continued.

After the police came and took Dad away, Annalise, Mom and Robbie moved to a new highrise, with no garden.

rimshe,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rimshe/the_thing_between_stars/,The Thing Between Stars,54,6,1639763288.0,"We first noticed it when the light of an entire galaxy vanished overnight. 


Dwingeloo 1 just blipped out of existence. It was about 9.13 light years away, so it must have gone out some time ago. 


Next was NGC 55, or more commonly called The Whale Galaxy. At 6.5 light years away, it was closer to us than Dwingeloo 1 but far enough where we could observe the phenomenon from a distance.


Gravity pulled other bodies accordingly, positions shifted, but we had no way to trace where they had moved to. 


At the time of this document, over 100 galaxies over various distances have vanished. We got a dedicated team to observe specific galaxies, and document any anomalies they can find. 


“Sir, can you...come here for a second?” My team leader asked. I looked at his computer, seeing a large, inky blob slowly engulf the light being emitted in his feed. 


“What is that?” I asked. Maybe something was just moving in front of all these galaxies? Blocking the light from reaching us, maybe. 


“I’m not sure, I’ve gone back and reviewed this a thousand times.” My leader replied in a low voice. “If you look at the stars above it, they seem to go out for a second, before flickering back, like something is passing in front of them.”


It took weeks of review, and unfortunately for all of us, we figured out what it was. Our announcement was translated to every language, for every government to know about. We knew mass panic may occur, but everyone needed to know the threat, that they could simply vanish out of existence in a heartbeat. 


It was an organism, one bigger than anything we’ve ever seen in space. It floated through the vacuum the way a person would swim through a lake. We couldn’t make out specific details of the creature, all we knew is it was black, had flagella-like tentacles to propel itself, and it could move faster than the speed of light if it sensed prey. 


The worst part was we discovered what it ate. Galaxies. 


To a creature that massive, surrounded by the void of space, a galaxy must appear the same way a berry on a tree would. If and when the creature got hungry, it would float over to an entire galaxy, and engulf it into itself, consuming it. 


We have no idea how long it’s been doing this. The light from galaxies takes so long to reach us that we might not know how many are gone in this lifetime. 


As expected, the world panicked when we told them, mainly because of the question that every person who heard immediately had; ‘how long until it reaches us?’


Truth is, we don’t know. We’re just a small speck in a massive sea of galaxies, the creature might never get to us, or it might get to us tomorrow.


All we can do is hope for a bit of luck from the universe.

It is impossible to look into their tiny little faces, and not find a smile forming upon your lips. They are adorable!


Everyday I go to work at the lab happy. Knowing that it is another day that I spend with Norb and Susan.


They hate being at the lab, I feel their anguish in my mind. We are linked, bonded by love! Telepathy is our little secret. For if my boss knew that Norb and Susan were speaking with me through the mind, they would either think me insane, or worse, subject me to testing!


I discovered them deep within a cave in Antarctica. They were just eggs then, seemingly abandoned by their mother, or perhaps she died, who knows? At first they were just a curiosity, but as soon as they hatched, I felt within my very bones, a sense of responsibility, like that of a new parent upon seeing their newborn for the first time.


As I drive towards the lab, I hear them calling to me from their enclosure. They are hungry. They had not eaten anything since yesterday afternoon. It pains me to hear, but do not worry my little ones, I shall be at the lab soon.


I arrive at the lab, and check myself in. My brain is only focusing on one thing, the eager beckoning of my babies. They know I am here.


I rush straight towards my lab, and finally get to see Norb and Susan. Their enclosure is getting too small for them. I'm going to have to ask for a bigger containment tank. Norb and Susan both had their faces pressed against the glass, eagerly awaiting cuddles with daddy!


I could not help myself. I went straight to the tank, and reached my arm inside. Susan squirmed her way up my arm first. And Norb wrapped himself around my wrist like a bracelet. I kissed each of them, and they let out a wet squelching sound in approval.


With Norb and Susan both perched upon my shoulder, I checked my email. No! The test subject I requested has been denied.


How will I feed my little ones! They both sensed my annoyance, and Norb let out a little screech, and Susan soon did the same.

Instinct. Urge.

You were trained to ignore these things. Grew up learning how to swallow them, hide them away in the back of your mind, bury them under cold layers of self control and emotionless logic.

*Your life depends on it*, they’d tell you.

And for twelve years, you could. When faced with the challenge, you always came through. But in the depths of your restless mind there was always turmoil; grisly imagery depicting rivers of blood, the tearing of flesh from bones, the plucking of soft squishy eyeballs from cavernous sockets. 

And the echoing screams of the dying.

You came close to losing it a couple of times admittedly. When facing down your uncle for instance, there was a second there where you almost lost control. Where you succumbed to the *triebe*. In many ways he deserved it, you figured. He wasn’t a very good man.

And so you swallowed it. The instinct. The urge.

And your brother. Can’t forget your brother. If your mother hadn’t been there to help you bury the urge, there’s no telling what would have happened. If you close your eyes though, you can still imagine it. Teeth digging into the veiny part of his neck, hands reaching through a gnarly wound in his abdomen, slowly pulling out all those slippery, mucusy, odd looking things that are supposed to be on the inside.

Sometimes you wonder what it feels like - what it tastes like - intrusive thoughts that keep you up at night, chipping away at those meticulously formed barriers of indoctrination. 

Then there was your father. It all happened so fast. One minute everything was fine, and in the next a crimson veil was pulled over your eyes. You bit your lip bloody, pinched yourself blue. You came so incredibly close to losing it. But you conquered it.

Instinct. Urge.

*Triebe.*

It’s a German word, your mother told you. From the Old World. From a world where you didn’t have to choose to ignore it. You could just live with it then. Allow it to take control.

You cover your mouth with both your hands, but you can’t look away. Not this time. Not with her. You quickly realise there’s no use in doing anything but hiding; they are already on top of her, tearing away at her flesh, blood pooling out from under her pale broken body in thick, unsteady streams. The sight of black rotten teeth chewing and suckling and slurping is almost enough to make you-

*Triebe*, she mouths silently to you one last time, before they pull the skin from her face.

And so you ignore it. The triebe. The instinct. The urge to empty your lungs and scream and cry and wail and sob and draw attention to yourself.

This is how we survive.

We swallow the instinct, hide it away in the back of our minds, bury it under cold layers of self control and emotionless logic.

And then we mourn them in complete silence."

I lay down the knife on the cold floor of the church, crimson melting into rotting wood.

“I have heard thy words.”

I take out the ring from my pocket, stuck forever to a stubborn finger.

“I have spread thy message.”

Finally I unhinge the sack from my back. I place it carefully next to the other two gifts, holding my breath against the thick stench of rot. When I let it go blood boils at its bottom and sinks heavily down into the ground below it.

“I have carried out thy commands.”

I sink myself down, bent deep in prayer - dragged down by the weight of my sins, lifted up by the promise of freedom.

“Will thou not spare me?”

I wait, sitting in the stink of sin and the dark of ignorance, until a beam of salvation is cast down upon me through the church window, shining down on my bent, beaten body and the souls I have brought forth for my God’s judgement.

And somewhere beyond the Earth, beyond the universe, my God tips back his head and laughs.

**”*Spare ye?*”** He laughs. **”Ye, who would so blindly sin for an unknown God? Ye, who would cast aside his morals for a cause of which he knows nought?**

**Ye, who hath never questioned whether he spoke to God or Devil?**”

He laughs harder. Harder. The light past the window dims, fades.

**”There is no place in heaven for you, child,”** He says, **”and no place in hell. When the Rapture comes you will die as you have lived: as nothing.**

The voice and the light are gone. Blood spills onto my knees. It is cold and dark and I am alone."

From a very early age, I knew I was born to be sold into someone’s ownership.  

I saw it happening to others all around me.  My brothers and sisters, the others who lived nearby, on the lower levels.  

Then one day it was my turn.  

Still young, I had barely had a chance to live a few months there with my family before the man came and saw me.  

His eyes showed his interest and he wet his lips, pulling me from my kin and inspecting me like I was already his possession.  If my mother could have spoken, I’m sure she would have called out, screaming at him:

“Take your hands off my child, you beast of a man!”

But it was already too late.  

He walked away with me in his arms and brought me to the woman who owned us all.  She surveyed the man with a shrewd eye, judging his worth and denying his attempts to haggle for my life.  

Regardless, the man knew what he wanted and walked out of the store with me as his new belonging.  His new possession to show off to his friends.  

Once he got me home, I realized he was not a kind man.  Or a good man.  

He ruined my face the first week, tossing a cup of coffee at me, “accidentally,” according to his words.  Then, a few days later, he left me out in the sun, locking me outside the house in the backyard.  I was so dehydrated by the time he finally came out to get me that I couldn’t say a word, not that I had said anything to him yet anyways.  I chose to remain silent out of protest and anger.  

Finally, the last straw happened yesterday when he wrecked my spine, the big imbecile!  He mumbled something like an apology as if he hadn’t meant to do it, his hands too strong for their own good.  But it didn’t help me.

Now I’m bent and broken, cracked and weathered from the sun, my jacket stained from the coffee he threw at me.  

But eventually the monster was finally done with me.  

He’s found some other fresh young thing to torture, now that he’s used me up.  

The new purchase he’s brought home this time has a shiny red sticker on her jacket, reading 50% off.  

She’s a hardcover, just like me.  Except her jacket is new and shiny, unstained by coffee.  Her pages aren’t dogeared like mine, her spine isn’t bent and broken.

His phone rings and he throws her unceremoniously onto the coach, where she lands splayed open with her pages bent and twisted.  

“Psst, hey.  Hey, you,” a voice says, and I realize it’s the abused new book.  

“Yeah,” I call back, and read the cover, beneath the 50% off sticker.  

The title reads: Gone Girl.

Her father sighed.


""I know, sweetheart. I know."" He rubbed his daughter's forehead in an attempt to comfort her as she lay tucked into bed. ""It's just the way things are, though. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it.""


""Does that mean I'll never see her again?"" 


Harriet's dad mulled the question over, making a face as if it left a bad taste in his mouth. He'd always told himself that he wouldn't repeat the same mistakes that his own parents had made, that he'd always be honest with his children. Even when it hurt. He gazed into the tear-filled eyes of his nine year old little girl and felt his own welling up as well. Stamping it down, he did his best to stay strong. 


""The truth is, we just don't know. Maybe, some day. But it's a mystery, one none of us really know the answer to. What's important is the time that we *did* spend with her, while she was still here.""


""Well, where is she now?"" The girl was indignant, hurt. Stubbornly, she couldn't accept it and began throwing a tantrum. ""I want to see Grandma, RIGHT NOW!"" 


""Shhhhh."" He put a finger to her lips. ""Your mothers sleeping. She's had a really hard day. We all miss Grandma very much. Especially her."" He fixed the now loose bed covers and made his way over to the door. Turning off the light. ""I know it isn't easy, sweetie. But you'll understand one day.""


""Well, I don't *want* to understand. *Ever*."" Harriet folded her arms and pouted. 


""I'm so sorry, honey. I hoped you'd never have to go through this. Try and get some sleep, okay? Things'll be better in the morning, you'll see."" 


With that the door quietly closed and the room was illuminated only by the dim night light plugged in against the far wall, casting little moon and star shapes against the smooth white ceiling. Harriet felt her eyes begin to close. But before she could slip into that dark reprieve, she noticed something among the curtains. A mass. She peered down and that's when she saw them. The legs. Her grandmother's legs. All pale and veiny.


""Grandma?"" The girl asked, perplexed but ecstatic. ""Why are you hiding behind the curtains?"" 


A face slowly peeked out, wrinkled and grinning. It put a single bony finger to it's thin, cracked lips.

Sailing is impossible without sails, ropes and knots - unless your aim is to drift aimlessly in the vastness of the sea. 

There are all sorts of knots for situations you may encounter, whether it be to dock your sailboat, to serve as a stopper, or to connect lines. A good knot could mean the difference between life and death. 

We present 5 essential knots for all sailors to know, whether you are a beginner or an expert.

*The Bowline*

The bowline is used for hitching, mooring and lifting things, and has many uses all around the ship. It can support a large weight, but is also easily undone.

* Form a loop in the line.
* Bring the end of the line through the loop.
* Wrap the line around the standing portion.
* Bring the end of the line through the new loop formed.
* Pull to tighten.

*The Reef Knot*

The reef knot (also known as the square knot) is mostly used to connect two lines together. This is useful if the length of one rope is insufficient.

* Cross the end of the first line over and under that of the second line.
* Bring the ends of both lines to face each other.
* Cross the end of the first line under and over that of the second line, then tuck it under again.
* Pull to tighten.

*The Clove Hitch*

The clove hitch is used to attach objects. It can be used along with other knots to hang something up. This set of instructions deals with tying the hitch around an attached pole.

* Bring the rope around the pole. 
* Cross the end of the rope over the stationary portion of the rope.
* Loop the end of the rope around the pole again.
* Bring the end of the rope through the new loop formed.
* Pull to tighten.

*The Noose*

Many things can go wrong on a sailing expedition. Your ship may be attacked by pirates or sink due to damage to the hull. Those scenarios are considered lucky - more than 80% of the ocean is unexplored, and humans do not know what else lurks in the sea. In such cases, it is better to throw away your own life than wait for others to take it. God may be unforgiving, but so are those who lurk just below.

* Bend the end of the rope two times to make two loops.
* Wrap the end of the rope around the first loop and through the eye of the second loop as many times as your shaking hands are able to.
* Pull to tighten.
* Stand on the chair and secure the other end of the rope to a post with a clove hitch (above). Make sure that it is of sufficient height.
* Put your head through the loop. It should fit snugly.
* Jump off the chair.
* Hope that your neck breaks before those below can stop you.
* If you survive, pray."

Last week my grandma died. True story. 84, She started to lose her marbles. She was always a strong willed woman. Steady fast. Old fashioned. The type of woman you knew where you stood. 

She didn't want to succumb to the illness eating her brain, so she threw herself out of a fourth floor window in her home. Dramatic? How do you think we feel? 

I fought with why she did it. What made her make that choice? 

Grieving was hard. Still is… in a way. After about a week and a half, we had her funeral. The family argued as per-normal. Words were said, tears were shed. And after, I went back to her house and tried to savor what little of her was left, even though the place was cold, empty.

Yesterday I found an app called Cemetery. It has a few features. One: you can see the tombstones of those that have been added to the database. Over three million so far. 

Secondly, you can upload a voice or video file of the one you lost and the algorithm in the app can take the voice and play it back to say a number of things. 

Mostly like, *I miss you* *I love you* *I'm at peace now* that sort of thing. 

I trolled through my videos to find any of my grandma. There weren't many as we just enjoyed our time together rather than capturing the moments we had. I think that's better? The memories in my head are worth more than playbacks. 

That night I uploaded the one video I found from a few years back. It was a silly one. One where we were playing Scrabble. She loved that game. 

The upload button loomed at me. Did I really want to hear her that bad? I decided I did. 

After a few minutes I pressed the play button on one of the options. Tears came as I heard her voice. I played it to distraction, forgetting about myself and the world. I'll admit, I slept well that night. 

But today? I'm not so sure.

I played it again, but my nan's voice was shrill, haunting. And the words weren't *I love you*, or *I miss you* anymore. She was screaming. Wailing of angony and torture. 

Cold dread ran through me as the button stuck and the voice continued to holler. 

*IT BURNS! IT BURNS!*

It is terrifying hearing the app because it has no way of knowing that we had nan cremated."

Destruction is what consumes me. 24/7. I see burning, I see fires, I see smoke. The glowing red hue of it, miles high. Does it mean what I think it does? Does he mean what he wants me to think it is?

I was born in Brazil. I don’t know when. The day, I mean. Nobody kept track.  I grew up as the neighborhoods kid, house to house, but never had one to call my own. 

It was harsh. It was bad. Was it God himself who condemned me? Was it God itself?

After I was taken in, I was taught abrahamic teachings. I was taught ideas and concepts I never had learned before. The held tongue hears most after all. I was educated, I was emulated. I was exceptional to them.

I was flown around the world. Island to island. My hands who were born to touch dirt touched diamond. My silk clothes hiding my upbringing. My woven threads hiding my scars.

I had what the others didn’t. I don’t know why, or what. I only knew how. I only knew how to hear. I only knew what I was told by Nick of Old.

I began to lie. I began to foretell of space, of technology. Of a world united under prosperity. The held tongue speaks most. The held tongue knows most.

My words spread like gospel among high of society. The words of the one who survived and saw. I kept seeing. I kept lying.

My tongue never betrayed my despair and hope.  Hope will ruin. I saw a world dry. A world with the last crops burned by fire. I saw the world how it began and how it will end. And how it will be.  A world of smoke, famine, starvation.

Where is God for all his children? Where was  my father and my mother for all theirs? For me?

This world was lost to greed and evil, this world was lost to fire and love crushed. The world was lost to the screams unheard and unseen. The ones in control who drank from the fountain of youth while unclean.

The skies will be red. The air will be unbreathable. Radiation burns will be untreatable. Helicopters overhead will blot out the sunset on a dying civilization.

This is what I see.

ribkqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ribkqk/sophias_choice/,Sophia’s Choice,642,37,1639724442.0,"Sophia had been born into privilege, and she came to understand how to use that privilege to her advantage at an early age. She wasn’t flamboyant about her station in life, but she knew that her and her kind were subject to a different set of rules than everyone else—and she lived unwaveringly by *her* rules.

She’d been living by her rules when she’d gone to that restaurant and had one too many, and she’d been living by her rules when she’d decided to drive herself home. Of course, then came the accident—she ran a stop sign and T-boned a minivan, killing a six-year-old boy. But naturally, her rules had been in play when the police department “lost” the results of her blood-alcohol test, as well as when the district attorney decided not to charge her with a crime. It’d been *a most unfortunate accident*, according to the D.A.’s press release.

Skating on the vehicular manslaughter charge had caused outrage in the community, so Sophia had hired a bodyguard. She had two small children, after all, and they needed to be protected from the general riffraff. Her husband had left her for one of their mutual friends a year prior and was vacationing in France. Having the bodyguard made her feel safe.

Of course, that false sense of security drained away at 11:04 p.m., which was when she saw her bodyguard lying on the floor in a pool of blood. An instant later she saw the gun—which was being held by the father of the six-year-old who’d died in that *most unfortunate accident*. Her rules had suddenly run afoul of her reality.

“I’m not here to debate,” he said. “You and all the world know you should’ve paid for killing my son. I’m here to see that you do.”

Once the shock had settled, she began trying to bargain. She begged, she pleaded, she cajoled, she offered favors of all kinds—but the man wouldn’t be swayed. He’d led them to the bedroom where Sophia’s two young children slept: five-year-old James and four-year-old Tabitha. Sophia knew what was coming before he spoke.

“You took my son’s life. It’s only fair that you also take the life of one of your own children.”

“*What?*”

“What d’you think? A boy for a boy—or maybe the girl, to balance things out?”

“*You can’t do this!* *You’ll never get away with it—you’ll get the death penalty!*”

“Perhaps—and you’ll still be without one of your children.”

“*Don’t you know who I am!*”

“Indeed I do.”

“*I won’t—I won’t do it!* *You can’t make me!*”

“I’ll make it simple for you. Either you kill one of them—or I’ll kill them both.”

In all her life, Sophia had never seen such certainty in another human’s eyes, and she knew—she knew her rules no longer applied.

Minutes later, her neighbors across the valley heard a distant scream. They wouldn’t know the why of it until the next morning."

I passed a guy doing Ironic stripped-down covers of Christmas classics, a handful of carol singers, and an Ed Sheeran wannabe.

The girl selling empty-looking jelly jars wasn’t singing, and she had no instrument.

The girl just stood there silently, outside a closed-down mattress store.

I asked if her jelly jars were a “Legend of Zelda” reference, but she didn’t get it.

She just stood staring straight ahead; No sales pitch, no anything.

No holiday joy inside those cold eyes.

I asked the price, and smiled at her reply, but the girl’s face never changed.

She seemed to care little, either way, if she made a sale today.

Intrigued, and in no hurry to get home to my cold apartment, I picked up a jar and sure enough I saw and smelled nothing within.

The girl lit a cigarette, and muttered that these were “dream jars”, as if it were a nuisance for her to speak.

After stamping out her cigarette, she said that If I breathed a bad dream into one of these jars, sealed it, then buried it deep, the dream would be trapped underground.

I thought that if I bought a jar, it’d make a neat story, so I offered her a dollar and she snatched it without a word.

I have a kindly nature, and waved away the handful of change she handed me.

I never saw the girl again.

Upon arriving back home, I saw that the jar was rather dirty, and scuffed and scratched.

I had a shower, watched TV and went to bed, and had a dream so terrible I honestly woke up wishing I was dead.

My sheets were soaked as if from some tropical fever, and I’d dug my fingernails into my palms so hard that my comforter was flecked with red.

To my horror, my battered brain recalled a little glimpse of my nightmare, like an aftershock, and I screamed loud enough to wake the dead.

I’ve really never believed in the supernatural, but I grabbed that open jar and I breathed ragged breaths into it, begging every trace of that night’s dream to be gone from my head.

I duct-taped it shut, and headed straight out into the woods before daybreak, to bury the thing.

I took a “sick day”, which was spent hyperventilating on my couch, dreading the darkness that swept all away the daylight all too soon.

Sleep came very late, and didn’t last long.

That evil dream was not repeated, I guess because it’s buried deep beneath the earth; hopefully in so remote a location that the girl will never find it, and release it onto some unsuspecting soul.

That was last Christmas.

I don’t know what the girl did with the other nine open jars.

In the year that has passed, my nine vile nightmares have very nearly been the death of me."

I started laughing, and found almost immediately that I couldn’t stop. It was too absurd.

Curtains are drawn, doors locked, and holly tucked above the threshold. Salt is poured across doorways, and horseshoes are hung above the fireplace. Long before the sun sets, the townsfolk duck into cellars, chaining the entrances with silver.

Any livestock are locked in barns, secured with St. John’s wort and homemade bread, generously salted. The dogs go down into the cellars, tails between their legs, but the cats have disappeared. They know what they’re about, cats. And they’re much too sensible to be caught on the Longest Night.

The forest swells in the dying light, its shadow swallowing cobblestone and streetlamp. Voices call forth and back in tongues too old to name and music drifts on the wind, sharp to the ear and melancholy for all its lively pace. Any lamps left lit exhale into darkness and footsteps patter toward the town square.

Under the houses, townsfolk murmur prayers, sooth4 fussy babes, and watch the ceiling with saucer-wide eyes.

Doors rattle and windows shake. When none open, the footsteps patter away . . . only to land on the roof with a thump. Dozens of feet dance a jig, kicking off shingles and dumping snow down the chimney.

In one unlucky home, the fireplace was left unguarded. The family jumps as a parade of feet clamor across the floor, pirouetting as the owners cackle. A crash sends the family huddling close, but it’s the first of many. After an hour of high-pitched laughter and house-shaking smashes, the chattering voices fade back up the chimney and on their merry way.

Most families wait out the night, giving the sun plenty of time to rise. But not all are so lucky.

Jeremiah’s grandmother took him in after his parents died, but she’s getting old. Sometimes she forgets herself and looks for her husband, dead for over a decade. This night, she remembers what her old Mam said about Longest Night and tucks herself away.

But she forgets Jeremiah.

The little boy sleeps soundly in his bed when the footsteps fall. Half a dozen murmuring voices, punctuated by snorts and laughs, surround him. Long-fingered hands with too many joints reach for his baby-soft skin.

In the morning, when stock is taken, they will find the bed soaked crimson. The bones they bury sport teeth marks."

Jeremy added the picture, the one from his cousin's barbecue four years prior when he didn't look quite as gaunt as he did now, to his profile to top it all off.

Meeting people and striking up a rapport was never the issue, it was when things became intimate that he got squirrly. Uncomfortable, as if trapped. But the isolation was getting to him, and a familiar craving was beginning to envelope his waking life as well as his dreams.

It was a young, beautiful cat, its fur being bright white. The cat was owned by a young boy. The boy was like any other boy his age, playful, energetic, and curious of the world around him. The young boy loved his cat, he cherished it with all his heart. He would go to school and tell his friends about his cat! Of course, being young, the other kids never paid attention to his cat. They were more concerned about running around and playing than listening about another boys cat.

This made him sad, he though people hated his cat. So he cried. Until a girl walked up to him.

""What's wrong?"" She asked. 

""Everybody hates my cat!"" The boy cried.

""I think I would like your cat, can I meet him?"" The boys face lit up with joy when he heard this! He was going to have a friend to show his cat to! When he got home he immediately told his parents! They thought the idea sounded lovely, so they set up a time and day for them to meet.

The boy showed the girl his cat. She loved his cat so much! She thought he was fluffy, and nice, and cuddly. Whilst the were playing the girl asked him a question. 

""How does your cat work?"" The boy had never thought of how his cat worked. He only knew that he needed to feed it everyday. This question stayed with the boy for hours until the girl left. He loved his cat so much, but he didn't know how it worked, so he asked his parents.

They just laughed at him and told him not to say such silly things. This made the boy very sad. He only wanted to know how his cat worked! So he waited for everyone to go to sleep to find out how they worked. He knew that one way to find out how something worked, was to take it apart.

So the boy found a hammer and hit his cat in the head with it. Some red liquids spilled out, but the boy was oblivious to his actions. He though the hammer might break his kitten. So he looked for a screw driver. However he couldn't find one.

So he settled for the next best thing, a knife. He went back to the cat and started taking it apart. He was most curious where food went when the cat ate. So he looked at its belly and started taking it apart. To the boys surprise, the cat was filled with ropes and red water!

How curious."

I never learnt his name, the other one, something about him, maybe it was his low voice, quiet as a whisper. Uncanny in his demeanour too, a tall, wiry, crane-neck man constantly with a toothy grin on his face.

It never occurred to talk to him, he went about his tasks as did I. That’s why as I was finishing up and as the fog rolled in on that one cool autumn evening, I was all the more surprised when he spoke to me.

“Alright partner?” The man approached, with a jolly tone and a grin on his face
“Just finishing up are you?”

“Yeah” I replied hesitantly, I must just be paranoid, I always thought he was creepy but I’ve never even spoken to him.

“Cool, I’ll be seeing you tomorrow then” he mutters as he walks off. He falters. Turns around and asks-

“Say, why did you start working at this graveyard anyway? You’re a young lad, it doesn’t get much more boring than this.”

I felt stupid for being so nervous to talk to him, we’d been working with each other for weeks. 

“Yeah, it’s boring but I like the peace” I replied.

“Won’t get much peace round here, it’s a haunted graveyard” he joked, and for a moment I felt at ease. The cool autumn air with the fog rolling in, laughing easily with a guy who used to put me on edge for no reason. I stood up and shook his hand.

“Michael, pleasure to meet you”

“Nice to meet you Michael” he smiled.
“Say, you wanna hear a ghost story”

I chuckled, “I don’t believe in ghost stories”

“Don’t you?”

I made him swear to me that his only priority was my pregnancy after we found out I was expecting. He swore to me that he would only care about the pregnancy and nothing else.

**Today, I’m going to teach you how to play hide and seek.**


**1. Find a place to hide**

With heavy breath and stunted lungs, I peer out through the slits in the closet door. I see dad stumble into the living room. He fumbles with his glock, until the safety clicks off.

I hear it shambling around. I hear it, but judging by his expression, he sees it.

**2. Don’t make a sound**

He points his gun into the kitchen. 

“G-get back. Get the fuck back!”

Two rounds are fired into the darkness. The beast responds with a manic shriek, and charges. His eyes widen, and he goes to pull the trigger one more time, but only hits the ceiling as he’s tackled to the ground. He screams as he dies. His blood paints the carpet a dark crimson.

It takes all of my willpower to not cry out, to not begin sobbing. I clench my teeth, as my bloodshot eyes water.

**3. Stay out of sight**

It is about to begin eating, but for some reason, it pauses, and looks in my direction. It gets up on its hind legs for a moment. Its tiny eyes scan the room. Its black, rotting snout sniffs the air. 

**You seem to be getting the hang of this. Lets review, one more time**

**1. Find a place to hide**

I slowly back away from the closet door.

**2. Don’t make a sound**

A deafening shriek pierces the quiet night. I hear something coming towards me.

**3. Stay out of sight**

The closet door is shattered to pieces, sending little bits of wood flying everywhere. I try to run out, but I feel a pair of claws tag my back. 

**It appears our friend has been caught. Unfortunately, this is his last round.**"

Everyone does something that is looked as creepy behind curtains and it's just nature really, but I guess some people have a higher degree of creepyness. I am a firm believer that everyone is a little creepy in some way and even the most innocent of individuals can do creepy things. Like the woman who has trapped her daughter in a secret room because the mother can't handle her growing up, you might think that the daughter is not creepy in any kind of way. 

The daughter likes to urinate on strangers walking past her house and she does this by slowly opening the secret window, which is hard to see from the outside. The daughter gets a good laugh about it, by urinating on outside strangers and even even when her urine starts to burn their skin sometimes and reveals what creature the really are, she gets a good laugh. Even the way she laughs it actually sends bugs inside your skin and the only way to get them out is by using a shark knife, the daughter laughs in a creepy way on purpose because she also enjoys people freaking out when bugs are crawling under their skin. 

You might think though that the way her mother treats her as a prisoner and does inhuman things to her, that the daughter isn't creepy at all, you are wrong as I have already told you the reasons why. Then there is Lewis, a boy in school who gets severely bullied by a group of kids but when he gets home he has all of his bullies body parts in pieces. He does strange things with their body parts and that is why when the bullies form back together again for school, they bully Lewis for it. 

When Lewis's bullies are in separate parts he uses Thier limbs for different reasons like using their arms to pick his nose, to pluck out tiny little people so he can eat them. He likes using his bullies head to remind his own head, what a head is supposed to look like by screaming at them. Then the bullies form back together again with their bodies in full for school, and they bully Lewis at school so badly for it. You might feel sorry for Lewis if you saw him getting bullied at school, but what he does to the bullied when they are in pieces is damn right creepy. 

Even I am a little creepy because how else do I know that everyone is creepy. It's because I follow them around and break into their houses without them knowing and stay for a couple of days, but knowing everyone is a little creepy gives me some peace."

In a quiet corner of the North American Union, tucked under two-hundred feet of bedrock, there’s a room, a corridor really, containing three human skeletons and a display screen with a small rectangular icon marked:

*EXECUTE*

Two-hundred thirty feet above the room, there’s a desert biome nature preserve. It’s a popular destination for campers and vacationers from the orbital colonies, a place of austere beauty that stands as a reminder of what humanity, united, had saved. 

Recently, the preserve has become a place of fascination for technoanthropologists due to the discovery of a centuries-old carbon nanowire antenna exposed by shifting sandstone.

Had certain minutiae of technological history survived the Scarcity Wars of the early 2100s, those anthropologists might also have taken an interest in a repeating transmission, broadcast using a long-obsolete EMF carrier protocol. 

*…designated white, Western European origin, non-Hispanic.*

*For posterity, this is Dr. Samuel Knight, recording. The Ethnotags were supposed to be a tool for tracing genetic variation in global diasporas, a nano-robotic viral swarm that would attach to the end of mitochondrial DNA and follow populations…*

It’s said that the Scarcity Wars were fought over dwindling freshwater supplies. The genocides that horrified wealthy nations certainly owed their death tolls in part to that, but the true scarcity was power. Specifically, American power. 

China loomed, casting a long westward shadow. In India, a decade of instability at the end of the 21st century gave way to two more of soft-authoritarianism and tense but successful national unification efforts. The shadow grew. 

*…via reproduction. The Ethnotags were supposed to be a silent observer. We didn’t know about the marking, the designations, the artificial creation of race on a genetic level. Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid—those were archaic, arbitrary categories created to enforce a false hierarchy. With Ethnotags, they became…*

In America, a shrinking white minority clung to an expanding fiction of unfair deprivation. In reality, their middle class dreams had awoken in the pockets of the hyper-rich—a faction they had bolstered for decades. Animus flared and the shadows of the east began to look like monsters. 

*…a hierarchy of survival. The Ethnotags gave DNA a covert instruction—create nanites that hide and wait for activation.*

*I killed them—my two colleagues—so they wouldn’t execute the activation sequence, but I couldn’t disarm it. I am sealing myself in to protect humanity from yet another genocide. The nanites are death to anyone not…*

In 2398, a genetic programmer found an odd marker in her DNA, a line of text written in nucleic binary. It read: BLACK:\SOUTHEASTASIAN:\WHITE:\INDIANASIAN:\LATINX:\\{NON-WHITE;MIXED}. It struck her as odd, reductive, really, so she deleted it. A patch she uploaded to the Harmful Genetic Variance Initiative deleted 23 billion more.

By 2399, the only race was human. 

Fourteen years later, in a quiet corner of the North American Union, a technoanthropologist rappelled down a crevasse in the shifting sandstone. He found a room, a corridor really, and curiosity drew his finger toward a small rectangular icon marked:

My bundle of joy ran in front of me, a little girl so perfect in every way. Eyes as deep a brown as the bark on the trees next to us, curly hair a shade as rich as the mineral packed soil that welcomed my toes to dig in further. A bright beaming smile, not hiding any of her ambition or hope for the future. Her scarf flowed in the wind behind her, dancing in her happiness. She had always loved that blood-red accessory.

It was a warm day that summer’s morning. Everything shone brightly, encased in a dome of warmth and cheer. Yet, I find none of it shone as brightly as my darling little doll. It seemed almost as if she sparked the growth of the blossoms up on the trees, the precious petals encasing cups of sweet pollen for the bees and bugs, and the overgrown green grass. This world was such a haze, with dust covering my vision using a gentle pink colour as I strolled idly by. My nose tickled with the scent of freshly baked goods: bread, cakes, sweet pastries and buns. It truly was a fantasy out here underneath the slightly cloudy amber sky.

My dear’s voice called out, beckoning me to come over, that same grin greeting my ever-adoring eyes. I ran with such glee, imagining our future hopes, dreams, watching her life flourish, before catching up to her. I caught her with a tickle, and she giggled and laughed in my arms with such innocence. Her legs kicked in time with her chuckles, trying to escape my affection to avoid my wiggling fingers attacking her stomach.

A smile crept across my face.

I watched as the sky faded from a deep amber, covered and coated by black smoke clouds. I held my daughter close, my little bundle of joy, crying to myself with tears of happiness. Her body was still warm from the fire crackling beneath us. A knife lay in my hand, stained and cursed with that dark rose substance known as blood. Her struggling had ceased as the smoke choked me out, reaching into my mind through my nose and mouth. Her clothes were stained with her own life, as was her last wish: to leave quickly; I never wanted to see her suffer for long. Besides…

She had always loved that blood-red accessory."

You take stock of your bedroom, your bed, and yourself in turn. The clock on your nightstand reads 02:48. Nothing seems amiss. But there's a lingering sense of unease, as if you'd woken from a dream you cannot remember.

You get up and go downstairs, across the house and into the kitchen. Nothing feels out of place, and the feeling starts to fade. Taking out a glass and filling it from the tap, you take a look out of the kitchen window. You survey the front yard. Empty. From the far horizon, the light of the low-hanging moon illuminates the street outside. There are a few lights on in the neighbourhood, but the street lays quiet and restful. Just like you ought to be.

You finish your water, and take a minute to use the restroom on your way back upstairs. The gentle calm of an empty night has reasserted itself, and you feel nothing more than a desire to go back to sleep. You finish, wash your hands, and head up the stairs.

Your bed beckons invitingly as you enter the bedroom. You were wise enough to put the covers down as you left, meaning it should still be warm. You stop to take one final look out your bedroom window, into the back yard. You can see both your own and your next-door neighbours' fenced-in lawns, as well as the small stretch of woods just beyond. The light of the moon casts shadow from its position on the far horizon, but illuminates the trees and picket fences well enough that the only thing that moves (a small cat, as it were), is easy to spot.

Feeling comforted that what woke you was likely no more than a bad dream, you crawl down into your still-warm bed. It only takes a minute before you are once again fast asleep."

“So…. This visit is free from your workplace?”

I nodded, trying to keep my mouth open as the dentist carefully cleaned each molar. He removed the instruments from inside my mouth temporarily, swivelling on the footstool to grab another.

“I get free dental with Happy Accidents Insurance company.” I explained “I work as a customer representative.”  

“Ah yes!” The dentist smiled, polishing a small mirror implement “I do quite a few jobs for them. *Very* big on smiles.”

“Yep.” I gave a short groan “It’s all that gets drilled into us. Greet the customer, smile at the customer, laugh at their jokes-…It honestly gets so tiring.” 

I opened my mouth again, letting him check over my newly polished teeth. 

“Just about done.” The dentist concluded “But *one* last thing.” 

Both my wrists suddenly felt violently squeezed. When my head snapped back up, I found my wrists had been forcibly strapped down to the dentist’s chair with buckled restraints.

“What is this?” I half laugh “Why the straps?” 

The dentist didn’t answer me. He stood up and got behind me, grabbing my throat and slamming it back into the headrest with such force that I cried out in pain. I felt his cold, clammy gloves on my head. I could hear a twisting, and a bolting, and a thick iron bar was suddenly wedging my forehead to the seat. I couldn’t wriggle if I tried. 

It was then I saw him. My manager Ken swept silently into the room. He looked to me with cold, hard eyes. He held a manila folder. 

“Ken?” I spat out, bewildered “What’s going on?” 

“Your annual review was unsatisfactory, Steven.” Ken said flatly “Low Smile Scores. Low Customer Praise.”

Panting, I watched with wild eyes as the dentist came back to his tray of instruments. To my terror, I saw him uncoiling what looked to be a wire hanger with a pair of pliers.  

“When Happy Accidents Insurance has scores as low as yours, our free dental comes into play.” Ken answered stiffly “We call it the Wire Smiler. It’s a happy helper, for employees like yourself.” 

Shaking, I finally found my voice to tell my manager what I thought of him once and for all- but was stopped. The dentist had wedged two blocks deep into my jaws to prop them open. He snickered cruelly as I tried to spit them out. 

“How far back do you want me to tighten?” 

“Let’s go as far as we can.” Ken said, looking to me with a wicked smile “This one *really* needs a lesson in customer service…” 

I scream until I can only weep, ripping the faux leather from the seat as my cheek flesh is punctured first with a hook side of the wire. Then I can only whimper as it is tightened up like a screw, fasted to wire bolted deep into my drilled tooth.  

But that’s just how it is, at Happy Accidents Insurance. *All* of us are Grinners and Winners."

Each one was large and terrible, blood-strained to the point of bursting, some pooling tears of pain onto the dark cave floor.  Each one, in some inexplicable way, seemed to be screaming. 

We studied, day after day, picking and prodding at that awful, fleshy mass. Nothing helped. The eyes could not be removed, nor could the wall be separated from the confines of the cave. All our research, of which there was little, had to be conducted in that putrid, petulant darkness, with those horrible, vengeful eyes staring relentlessly into the depths of our being. 

They were human, almost, but not quite. Changed somehow - deeper, darker. Filled with a fear I doubt any man has ever experienced.

It was not until the 10th day that we noticed. The wall was growing a little less angry. The eyes were beginning to close.

We felt some sense of pitiful relief, at first. Until we realized. Exactly 10 eyes. Exactly 10 days. And - from then on - one more, every passing sunrise.

We always have dinner in my room at the bottom of the house. When I asked what was upstairs and what was beyond that, mom said that the outside contained nothing but monsters. Mom's so brave though for choosing to leave our home everyday to get me food. Maybe that's why she always carries that thing that goes ""pop!""

Everyday was the same. Lessons about the monsters, food, water, and the occasional sweets mom would make. I often saw her drinking something that wasn't water though and she drank a lot of it. She told me that it was her medicine for her heart, that she takes it so that she'll remain healthy so that she can take care of me longer.

Why were their words and actions so gentle?

Why did they look human? 

Then I saw mom on the floor and water was coming out from a hole in her heart. So I did what any good daughter would do...I ran to her and drank the water.

The other humans look horrified and one even almost vommited. The taller one then asked me what I was doing as he tried to stop me from drinking.

It was mostly thanks to her mother, although dad was a real piece of work, too. She once told me her parents found a candy wrapper she’d stashed under her mattress, which led to months and months of stomach pinches and fat jokes.

And as a result, the love of my life developed a *complicated* relationship with her body.

Now, obviously, my wife is beautiful. Breathtakingly so. But the problem is, she doesn’t see herself that way. Whenever she looks in the mirror, all she sees is that insecure ten-year-old girl whose mother insisted no man could ever love.

And, tragically, her existing insecurities were only amplified by social media. She began following countless influencers, most of whom photoshop the crap out of their pictures.

She told me that—even though she knew full-well these ladies presented a fictional version of themselves online—she couldn’t stop comparing herself to them, and constantly agonized over all the ways she fell short.

And so, I decided to step in.

Take my most recent target, for example. One look at this lady's million-dollar pout and my wife began contemplating lip fillers. I had to nip that in the bud fast.

After breaking into the lady's apartment, I tied her down and whipped out my blow torch, then ran it over her jaw until both lips melted away and the teeth became charred black. Even with extensive reconstructive surgery, she won’t be walking down the runway anytime soon, and that means one less person for my wife to compare herself with.

But today, less than two weeks after the lip problem got resolved, my wife found a new obsession: cheekbones. There’s some up-and-coming model who’s famous for hers, and now I keep catching my wife studying her side profile in a hand mirror. I’m gonna have to track this woman down and solve the problem with a mallet.

My wife is NOT the most beautiful woman in the world. But someday soon, at the rate we’re going, she just might be."

She served everyone a hearty scoop of each, crowning every plate with a generous serving of ham. Eager to begin her meal, Martha was about to sit when she realized she’d skipped the final step!

“Silly me!” she laughed, rising again. “You can’t eat like that! Just give me a second.”

She went around the table, carefully peeling away the duct tape from her daughter’s and son’s mouths. When she got to her husband, he started chattering. “Martie, you don’t have to do this—I swear to god, I’ll never threaten to leave you again—”

“Oh, hush,” Marth said, frowning. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go at all. “Hush and eat your dinner, there’s a good boy!”

“At least let the kids go!” Her husband’s eyes were panicked, glancing at their children, then away. “I’ll stay here forever, I promise, just please, let the kids—”

“That’s enough of that!”

Martha replaced her husband’s duct tape, then sat at the head of the table. “Go on,” she said to her son and daughter. “Eat up! It’ll get cold.”

Shifting uncomfortably in their seats, the children picked up their silverware and began to pick at their food. It was difficult to maneuver with the rope binding them to the chairs, but they managed.

Smiling with bliss, Martha poured herself a glass of champagne and watched her happy family enjoy their meal.

It was the perfect way to spend Christmas Eve. And her husband was right—he wasn’t going to leave her. None of them were.

In fact, no one would ever be leaving the house again.

Martha smiled. “Don’t forget to leave room for dessert!”"

He wasn’t exactly starving as the bins in their own area were perfectly adequate, but Kyle visited restaurant bins and was usually able to forage something tastier to share .

Technically, Three should have been called Three-and-a-half, as he still had more than half a leg. No-one knew how he had lost the other half, but Three seemed fine with his lot in life, a stray urban cat petted and fed by the building residents where he usually prowled.

He was a striking beast, muscular and big with glorious orange-gold and black markings, a veritable urban tiger. He was friendly too- whatever had caused the loss of his leg had not soured his view of humanity.  More than one resident had tried to entice Three to go home with them, but Three preferred to keep his proud sociable independence, maintaining friendships not just with residents, but also with the homeless wanderers who squatted in that area more and more.

Like Kyle, who had brought him back baked salmon. “Crazy that people throw this out, eh?” he muttered, breaking off pieces of the beautiful pink flesh and holding them out to Three, who gobbled them up eagerly. “Easy tiger!”  

After the meal, Kyle wrapped himself up in his tattered sleeping bag to prepare for his morning nap. He was hoping Three would nap with him as he sometimes did, but Three was feeling feisty after the salmon feast, and went back to the parking lot, checking out the comings and goings.

It was moving season, early fall, and the building, a student favourite, was seeing a lot of new young faces trundling in with their suitcases and backpacks. Three liked to know what was going on.

Suddenly Three’s whole demeanour changed. The fur on his back and tail stood upright as he stared at one particular young man, wheeling a battered suitcase behind him, crossed the parking lot.

Three padded quietly behind the young man, who was barely indistinguishable from the thousands of other young men hunched in hoodies, bustling around town.

Three drew his lips back and snarled.

A small flight of steps led into the building, and the young man had to bend down to pick up his suitcase.

The big cat launched himself full into the man’s face, hissing and clawing.

The man fell over backwards screaming at first with fright and then with pain as the sharp claws dug into his eyeballs. He tried to wrestle the big beast off his face, in vain.

People came running towards them, but Three let go before anyone arrived, and padded off majestically, blood dripping from its claws and teeth.

As the paramedics helped the man with the ripped face into the ambulance, one of them noticed a curious shrivelled object which had fallen from his pocket. He picked it up, intending to place it in patient belongings.

It was a cat’s leg. "

Well, between the missing people from baby's, teens, and even sometimes adults, it seems now it has killed more then it ever has. People are starting to leave every winter to go down south of arkansas, hell I wouldn't blame them, having the possibility of it breaking into your house is terrifying. Why don't we talk about... it? Well seeing it will make your skin crawl, and your hair stand ten feet tall. It stands hunched, with its spine ripping through its back, and it's body is slim to the bone. It's skin is a tan, yellowish color, while being rotted and torn. And God the smell, it could the flesh on the inside of your nose. It has no eyes or ears, it smells you, and that's how it finds you. I figured I should tell the world this information about the cryptic ""it"" that lives so close to us. I wouldn't recommend hunting for it, or coming to see it because of the danger it can present.

He was still having nightmares and this was the only way he could be comforted. She didn't mind; she felt as if it was the least she could do for the times she was too frightened to protect him from his father, Jayden.

""I'll turn that little queer into a real man,"" he always said. ""If it's the last thing I do.""

Taylor would sob tending to their bruises.

Everything changed one day when she was called to the school. Danny had wet himself and curled into a ball when another boy was innocently play-fighting with him. The Head was concerned and Taylor confessed to everything that had been happening.

When the police went to arrest Jayden he had already vanished. Despite searching for him at all his usual haunts he was never found. All that was left behind was a hand-scribbled note that said, 'I'll be back for Xmas.'

Taylor and Danny were both rehoused in a different county and the authorities promised her they would be around for Christmas in case Jayden reappeared.

Yet, on a snowy Christmas Eve, Taylor looked out of her window and saw no police presence. She rang to ask where they were and was bluntly told a patrol car would check up on her; they had been called away to help with a drunken brawl.

In all this time, she had never stopped being afraid. She worried that Jayden would turn up and punish her and her sweet little boy.

Despite her fears, Taylor was determined that Danny would have a Christmas where he wouldn't have to watch his mother being beaten or awake to no presents. She had found herself a job at the church and the money she had earned enabled her to buy some cheap gifts.

Yet, just before midnight, Taylor heard footsteps downstairs. She did all she could to not burst into tears. Frantically, she pushed her panic alarm.

Then she heard the sound of feet on the stairs and a *clump-clump* noise trailing behind.

The footsteps stopped outside her room and someone pushed her bedroom door open. Taylor cried out and begged not to be hurt.

Standing in front of her was Santa Claus - or someone dressed like him. He dragged a large red sack behind him.

""For such a short man he weighs quite a bit!"" He bellowed joyously.

Santa opened the top of the sack and peeled it downwards, revealing Jayden's head. Her ex-husband looked terrified. He had not been treated well and was pleading for help.

""This is my gift to you and Danny - and everyone like you. Merry Christmas!""

And with that they were gone.

And for the first time in years she finally felt safe and cried with the joy of the season.

On Christmas Day, the news broke that millions of dead, mutilated bodies had been discovered at the North Pole.

All of them inside bright red sacks."

I take myself way too seriously than a dying person, or a disabled baby and even those that are starving. Now I take myself so seriously that I stalk myself walking around, sitting in cafes, at work and even at home. I stalk myself because that's how seriously I take myself and that's how important I view myself. I have been stalking myself and not even caring at being caught and I have been making strange noises at myself, while I have been stalking myself. I have been listening to myself talk, laugh, cry and even in complete pain when lava started coming out of me. 

I have been observing how I grabbed people in television by their necks because they annoyed me and half their bodies was inside the television and the other half was out of the television. I observed myself making myself blind when something unpleasant is seen and how I deafened myself when something unpleasant is heard. 

Then stalking myself wasn't enough and I took myself more seriously than ever before by watching myself sleep. I then got a knife and started scratching myself and I got angry at the knife for not turning blunt. I then started waking myself up at various times of the night and I even started going violent. I am so important and I take myself so seriously that I watch myself in the bathroom and purposely turn the water to cold. I am so important and I am more important than presidents, refugees, every kind of CEO and this feeling of importance is only growing inside of me and I don't know why. 

I started to think of myself as far too important that I started to become an irritating customer when myself was at work. I even became the manager of myself and watched myself work a physically draining job. I gave myself more work because of how important I am and I knew that me being a manager to myself was not an appreciated thing. I needed to do more and so I abducted myself and locked myself in some abandoned place. I even grabbed a child on the way when I abducted myself. 

The place I am at is a haunted place and the child keeps crying and I am far too important to be dealing with a child. I shouted at the child about where his parents are and that they should look after him. Then ghostly voices started shouting ""keep the child quite or we will"" and this made the child cry even more. The child needs to learn to take himself seriously like I do. The child needs to deal with himself."

“Penny,” I replied, accepting the shivering green abomination. “The DMV calls me Penelope.”

She laughed, throwing her head back with PEZ-dispenser-esque theatricality. “You’re funny! Isn’t she funny, Waldo?”

*Waldo* looked like he could use a Klonapin or a blow job. Maybe both. “Very drole.” He smiled painfully. “Uh, your gardener, Penelope. He isn’t live-in, is he?”

*My gardener?* I didn’t—ohh.

“My *husband*? Amadi? Glasses, kinda tall, dreadlocks?”

The last descriptor made *Mitsy’s* left eye twitch, confirming something for the both of us. Again…yikes. 

Her smile tightened. “How…modern.”

YIKES. 

Amadi was less surprised that miscegenation was “modern” for our new neighbors. 

“Wait..Penny..Mitsy-with-the-good-pearls is…racist? *My stars…*” He swooned. I giggled. “Look, don’t let the solar panels and Biden signs fool you, Pen. They’ll welcome you, smile at me, but they associate a face like mine with a threat. It’s shitty, but…you know.”

I didn’t, not really, but that night, I stared at that ‘threatening’, handsome, loving face as he swiped through his iPad in the living room. I almost cursed the flicker of blue light from the window for spoiling his pensive focus. Amadi looked up. 

A moment later, there was a knock at the door. 

“Police. Open the door.”

Amadi knitted his brow and I gave my best reassuring look. We didn’t do anything wrong. It was fine. 

“Hello?” I said, looking through an obscured peephole. “Could you step back, officer? And what’s this about?”

I waited. 

*Thud Thud Thud*

“Police. Open the door.”

***THUD***

The house shuddered and behind me Amadi was gasping quick, short breaths. 

“Police. Open the door.”

***THUD***

“Open the door.”

My bravery crumbled into gulping sobs as the doorknob rattled.

“Sh-shit! Amadi, what do we do?”

I turned toward the living room. Where was—

“Amadi?”

“Amadi!”

Nothing…then 

*knock knock knock*

“Police. Have a safe night, ma’am.”

I looked for Amadi, screamed his name. He had been right there, feet away, fettered to an armchair by fear, and then just…gone. Now all that remained of him was his fading warmth on a cushion and an iPad. 

It was days before the queasy emptiness led me to his final internet searches.

Me? 

I was at my mom’s funeral, watching as they lowered her into the ground, when the dreary grey sky above erupted in colors the human eye wasn’t designed to behold. About half of us went blind, while the rest probably wish they had.

I know I do.

Then they crashed to the ground, one by one by one by one by one, until all the *one’s* totalled *nine-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-six-hundred-and-three.* Who counted them all, I don’t know, but that’s what we were told anyway.

AN INVASION? the headlines read.

It was a fair assumption, all things considered. Bunch of unidentified alien objects dropping from the sky, accompanied by the harrowing soundscape of the apocalypse? Buildings collapsing, martial law declared everywhere, presidents and prime ministers and fucking cult leaders taking turns trying to explain what the fuck was happening.

I knew what they were though. No doubt in my mind. 

I stood there in dumbstruck silence as one of them crashed right through my mom’s coffin. 

I stood there frozen in fear as she climbed out of the hole in the ground.

I stumbled back in utter terror when I noticed the…*thing* that had burrowed into to her skull.

And then I fell to my knees.

Some of them never made it to any hosts. Bad aim I guess. They drowned in the sea, or roasted in the sun, or just flopped around on the ground until scientists scooped them up in glass containers, and spent the next few months poking and prodding and scratching their heads.

I kept my mom hidden. What else could I do? What would you do? I knew it wasn’t real, *couldn’t* be real, yet there she was. Alive. Breathing. Existing.

For a little while, anyway.

That’s the part they never revealed. How the parasite would slowly consume the brain. Devour it. Replace it with itself. That’s why it took so long. Six months, give or take. Six months until the world learned what they were.

I knew though. I always knew.

When the first one spoke it was like the voice crept into your veins, travelled through your bloodstream, all the way from pore to flesh to mind to ear, and then exploded - just like the sky exploded that day - in sounds the human ear was never designed to hear. 

Half of us went deaf. The other half probably wish they had.

I know I do.

BE AFRAID, they said. 

I never really felt fear until they told me to. But I was always curious I guess. Why were they here? Why so many? 

And when we learned of all the *why’s*, we fell to our knees, and we cried, and we huddled together, and we wished we were blind and we wished we were deaf.

All nine-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-six-hundred-and-three Angels of the Lord had fled from Heaven.

And soon we will learn from what."

So much so, that growing up since I was a toddler, I’d never glimpsed her real face. Not even once. Her own son.

I know I was crossing boundaries, but can you blame me—a five-year-old kid back then—for being morbidly curious? I wanted to know. I ached to peel her away, layer by layer until I found my real mom.

So, after lying awake for hours, I climbed out of bed a long while after mom and dad went to their bedroom, once the house was still and dead quiet. I stole the knife from underneath my pillow then snuck out into the hallway.

I opened their bedroom door at a deathly slow pace without it creaking. Once inside, I tiptoed closer until I reached mother’s side. I brought the blunt side of the knife closer to her face. My intentions were obviously not to hurt her, but only to gently shave away the thick, flesh toned makeup that smothered her skin. What struck me as I neared was the stinging scent of the cloying perfume that clung to mom’s body.

The knife was only a sliver away from touching her face when I suddenly felt a fierce grip on my wrist.

I turned to look, spotted the hand clamped around, and my gaze trailed up the arm until I met my dad’s stern eyes in the dark.

He looked livid.

“Go back to your room,” whispered father, low enough to not wake mom, but laced with just enough anger.

I did my best not to pee myself while father’s glare burned holes into me, and I slunk away in shame back to my room.

I trembled as I pulled the covers to my chin, terrified at the prospect of all the ways dad would ground or punish me come morning.

Sometime later, my fear ridden body gave way and I fell asleep.

I was shaken awake by dad a few hours later, though it wasn’t yet morning, maybe dawn. I could tell by my still dark room.

“I haven’t been honest with you kiddo,” dad said in a weirdly gentle tone. “Come.”

So, I got out of bed and groggily followed dad when he motioned for me, led me into his bedroom again, then opened the door into his bathroom.

There was a towel strewn on the floor next to the sink. It was stained with powdery colours and dark smears.

In the bathtub sat mom, in a black bra and underwear.

To my surprise, her bare face had the makeup all scrubbed off.

I instinctively took a step back and gulped, though dad held my shoulder firmly in place.

As my teenage life progressed, I found that my desire to have a child was negated but the fact that I was gay. My love of dolls turned to porcelain ones. Old fashioned. Beautiful.

I never really fitted in. Even in my twenties I was shy and nervous. But when I met Jane, my world changed. She wanted children as much as I did, but was happy for me to carry our future child. 

After many years of discussing it, we decided to make a family. Consultations, tests and results led the way to insemination. Six days later, the doctor gave us the joyous news. I was pregnant. 

As my stomach swelled, we decorated the baby room; brought a crib, a rocking chair to feed in, mats, plates, dummies, nappies, the whole shabang. We were happy in our world, ready to start a family. 

Until, seven months in. Pain caused a rush to the hospital. I could feel my baby kicking, and with every toe punt, it felt like my sides were being ripped out. After a few minutes a nurse came to see me.

""Ma'am, we are going to take you to have an ultrasound. How many weeks are you?"" 

""Twenty-eight weeks,"" I said, as Jane pushed us down the corridor. The nurse scratched it down.

""And who is your doctor?""

""Doctor Atlas. He's a resident here."" 

She nodded and scratched that down too before we entered a white room. A few moments and an agony of undressing pain later, I climbed on the table. 

Cool gel. Light push. Nervous waiting trying to look at the monitor. 

“*Arrrrgh!* There? Did you see it kick?” I asked the nurse. She moved the ultrasound over my swollen stomach, a worried look on her face.

“Who did you say your doctor was again?”

“Doctor Atlas.’

She looked at me, biting her lip. “Ma'am. We don’t have a doctor of that name here.”

My baby kicked my confusion away. “Well, is my baby okay?”

Going to sleep at dawn… or sometimes even after dawn felt natural in the ways normal circadian rhythm could never compare. She knew that it was unhealthy and she should stop, but it was so nice and so quiet and so easy during nighttime. God bless freelancing for enabling her.

One of her new favorite things to do was looking out of the window at around 4 am. She found that 4 am was that time of the day that was simultaneously too late and too early for the majority of the population and felt strange camaraderie with every car that passed her window on the empty streets. 

She was so high on the feeling of being one of the select few to be awake at such hours that she didn’t even realize how she became accustomed to the shadows slithering around her apartment at night. The tired brain didn’t make the connection between a human-shaped shadow on the wall and the fact that there was nothing that could’ve caused that shadow. Perhaps, if she didn’t enjoy her new lifestyle so much, she would’ve considered that humans evolved to follow the sun rhythm for a reason and there must’ve been something truly terrifying in the night that early humans would fall out of the reality for eight hours on average every night rather than face it.

Or maybe, maybe she did notice the shadows. At some point, you just don’t really care. Maybe she saw exactly the shadowy figure retreat under her bed every time she abandoned her set up for a drink of sugary soda. Maybe she realized that the neon lighting of tabloids outside and her LED lights had no capacity to create such intricate patchworks of darkness. Maybe she didn’t care for the exact same reason she chose to go against the waking hours of most people. 

Maybe that’s why one night, at around 4 am she didn’t go to the window to look at the cars but just turned off the meaningless romcom and dimmed the graphic tablet, fully aware of the kaleidoscope of shadows beside her. When her playlist glitched out, the song stuck on two notes, an unfinished lyric gurgling in the headphones, she didn’t reach out to check her internet or reconnect her Bluetooth but just threw her head back, feeling a breeze on her face. Strange, the AC didn’t seem to be on. And when the shadows finally came to her, having staked out their victim for so long, she didn’t panic and just let herself fall into the shadowy vortex amongst the neon lighting.

The shadows closed in around her, a warm feeling spreading through every cell of her skin. She smiled as she was being devoured by the shadows. The murky beings didn’t leave anything except for her shadow behind.

Samuel noted the newer luxury cars in the driveway, they were the only changes to his older brother’s towering colonial house, the brick walls and columned facade were exactly the same as when they had last spoken over three years ago. Ever since, Samuel’s sincere, but flawed investment advice had hurt their family's finances. As the oldest sibling, Charles had no room for family members making costly mistakes and had managed to cut Samuel out of the family's fortunes beyond a comparative pittance for his living expenses to keep up appearances. The only part of the family’s money Charles failed to seize was a large but restrictive financial trust set up for Samuel by their late father. Samuel imagined any reconciliation between himself and his family, would require his willingness to allow Charles more access to the fund, regardless of whether that would actually help secure control of it.  

Charles had invited over a number of members of their extended family, and Samuel took pleasure in reacquainting himself with them. A few had even brought their children, many of whom he hadn’t seen since they were infants. They looked away in fright or stared at him in wide-eyed horror as he tried to introduce himself, backing away anytime he approached. Their parents said they were just nervous around strangers and would warm to him eventually.

At dinner, they began with a tray of champagne flutes to toast their reunion, but upon seeing them, the children started to cry. In moments, they were all screaming and wailing as tears streaked their faces before their embarrassed parents quickly ushered them from the room. With calm restored, beginning with Samuel, a servant placed one of the elegant glasses in front of each guest. 

The first dish was a delicious squash soup, to be followed by a roast pheasant. It wasn’t until the soup bowls had been cleared, and they were awaiting the main course, Samuel began to feel a burning sensation inside him. It began in his throat and quickly spread through his chest. For a moment he thought he was imagining it until he felt sweat trickle down his face and looked down to see his hands were beet red. He struggled to speak, but a thick mucus now filled his mouth and throat, cutting his airway and burning his insides. Jumping to his feet, he gripped the table for support, straining his abdominal muscles trying to push out the blockage. He managed to vomit forth bloody yellow mucus, but it welled up inside him faster than he could expel it. His family continued their casual conversations without even glancing at him. The last thing he felt was himself crash against the table and fall to the floor. Lying on the carpet, he struggled to turn onto his back, he could only taste burning bile as the conversations from the table above faded to a muffled noise; his last moments spent looking at the ceiling as his vision dimmed."

The only method our “brilliant” minds could think of was sending someone into one. Unfortunately, my dream job turned into a dreadful nightmare overnight because of this. 

Anxiety stabbed my mind and sweat covered my skin as I entered the pod with a mind racing faster than light itself. This hellish 6 hour journey threw me into a vacuum of a never-ending light show that was abruptly blocked by the light shifting and twisting. I was entering the gaping tear in reality, and fast.

Space vanishes, and I’m consumed by darkness. Silence pierced by thousands of shrieks and screams from the basements of hell. Millions of eyes shatter my soul as they gaze into my own. All they needed was a signal that we exist, and now they’re on their way to expand. They’re on their way to devour."

I observed the dim sky and allowed my eyes to close for just a second as the soft breeze kissed my cheek as my hand clapsed the pepper spray given to me by my sister.
The sound of shoes approaching my location made me look to the walking figure which to my relief turned out to be another woman. 

A warm smile sported her face as her strawberry curls bounced when she made the motion of sitting down with just enough space between us. Conversations soon filled that time which only added to the sense of security I had already felt.

The moment that made my stomach drop was when a red car, with its trunk open, pulled right in front of us. A man weilding a gun stormed out all the while pointing the weapon in our direction.

I wanted to act and mace him but something in my gut was screaming at me not to so I listened and watched things unfold. 

I watched as he screamed at the girl to get in the car, his voice boomed of fury as his eyes burned anger. Only then when our visions met that his eyes softened as if they spoke of an apology.

The begs she made as she knelt on the ground with her hands up went unheard as the man forcefully yanked her up, opened the front seat and pushed her inside. Her tears made mine fall too and with one last look, I lost her.

Off the vehicle drove and a while later the bus finally arrived as I found myself calling 9-1-1. 

Every question that I had that horrible night got answered as I both saw them in the news. What I learned that day made me question humanity even more.

The car was found in an open field with both passengers deceased, one of murder and one of a self-inflicted wound. The girl turned out to be a women trafficker, new to the sick trade, with her role as the one to give false sense of safety while the man was the boyfriend of one of her victims. 

I could not count on my fingers the trip I made to the bathroom that day as I kept asking myself if I was also an intended victim or was she just trying to go home too? Either way, I don't feel sorry for her, you don't do that to your fellow woman. 

Paranoia now plagues my life as trust issues had made me scared at the slightest ring of the doorbell. I hope to leave this hell soon."

rgp1e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rgp1e5/vantage_point/,Vantage Point,37,5,1639538084.0,"When we first came to view the house, it was there waiting. The mirror was hung on the wall in a corner of the living room by the stairs, angled in a way that allowed a view into each of the rooms downstairs if you stood in just the right spot. I was immediately drawn to it, fascinated by it’s peculiar nature and wondering why it was the only thing the previous owner had left behind. 

&#x200B;

The house was old, the floors creaked and the wallpaper was faded and hanging off in places. But to a newlywed couple, it was perfect in every way. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Over the next few months, we made it our home. Through all of the refurbishing I decided to keep the mirror exactly where it was. It *belonged* there. And there was something so reassuring about seeing our efforts reflected through it as we worked. 

&#x200B;

A year went by and the view from the other side of the glass began to change. Suddenly there was a high chair in the kitchen and the living room was now being overtaken by baby toys and baby clothes. I would smile as I came down the steps each morning, enjoying a brief glance at my wife and child through the mirror before walking into the scene it had given me a glimpse of. 

&#x200B;

Time continued to pass, as it so often does. Our baby went from crawling across the rug to stumbling over the hardwood, and before I knew it, my wife’s stomach had grown round once again. It wasn’t long before there were four sets of shoes by the front door and four places at the dinner table. The furniture was constantly rearranged and the pictures on the walls continued to multiply. Yet for all of the changes it reflects, the mirror remains a constant.  

&#x200B;

And I suppose this is why it haunts me. Or perhaps, this is why I continue to haunt it.

&#x200B;

Through this glass I have seen the happiest days of our lives. I have seen our most precious moments. And I need them. I crave them. They are the only thing that can make me feel alive. 

&#x200B;

Because the reality is cruel. The reality is empty, as empty as this house. There are no smiling faces waiting to greet me once I pass by it's smooth surface. There is only me. And the longer I'm alone, the more I have to wonder if it has always been this way. 

&#x200B;

So I remain. Trapped by a reflection and caught in the vicious grip of longing, I remain, hoping that one day I'll finally forget which side of the glass I'm really on."

I won’t obscure what I witnessed by coloring it with fancy words and varying descriptions. No, I’ll simply call it what it is, what my seven-year-old son had when he saw it with his own set of youthful eyes. A monster. 

“Nathaniel,” said my wife Shanon. “How much longer?” 

“I don’t know, but soon,"" I replied. ""Just don't look back. Make sure the kids don’t look either.” Her eyes traced the ground as she walked, our son by her side, and our daughter by mine. 

“Shanon,” I said. She looked up. “You hear me?” She nodded. 

That thing in the distance behind us rumbled the ground with each ferocious step it took. It towered the entire city, and its head peaked skyscrapers as its narrow arms hung below its waist. Fires roared atop buildings and black smoke billowed over them, forming dark clouds and completing the atmosphere of dread that had befell our city that day. 

We had been walking for hours, leaving our homes to escape the monster, but nothing pained me more than glancing over my shoulder at my family and to see them tired and hungry. 

So it was a relief to be able to look back at them and say, “We’re here.” 

“Is that it?” asked my son Julius. “Is that the shelter, Dad?” 

There were thousands of people there, people who had escaped the city. People just like us. It was a human sea of chatter and weeping. Their faces were scarred and clothes torn. Since that thing invaded our city and home, it brought humanity to its knees, forcing nations back into the stone age. 

“How many?” 

A man dressed in a navy-blue uniform stood guard at the entrance of the shelter. He and his colleagues were the only people there who looked showered and well-dressed. 

“There’s four of us,"" I replied. ""My wife Shanon, my daughter Bella, and my son J-” 

“Go ahead, sir,” said the guard. 

The shelter became our new home. We made entertainment for ourselves in primitive things. The children there, including mine, played by a large, decaying bridge in some morbid and oblivious scene. 

The adults, however, behaved accordingly. Their eyes embodied loss. 

I befriended an older gentleman who had been at the shelter for awhile. 

“You know,” he began “that thing in our city, they say it moves slowly because its stomach is full. When it’s hungry, it moves much faster.” 

""The hell does it eat?” I asked.  

“People.” 

I nodded. “Of course.” 

“It slows down when it's eaten enough people for the day,” he continued. “That’s what the government says. But safety comes with a price. Staying at this shelter is a price. Because we’ve done an efficient job staying away from that thing, it's getting faster, so the government's had to resort to other means of slowing it dow-” 

I looked around for Julius, ignoring the man. “Shanon, where’s Julius?” 

“Nathaniel,” the old man said to me. “That’s the price.”"

When the motley crew refused payment, the man said in a powerful voice, ""Well, if you charge me nothing for dinner and drink, may the spirits bless you."" Then the stranger seemed to sprout gossamer wings and fly away. He was quickly lost in a thick fog.

It came as a code, a series of binary that we spent years trying to translate into something we could comprehend. Eventually, we developed an AI to translate and read it back to us. 


“Can you see me?” The message asked. 


We were confused, especially because we had no real way to respond. Sure, we could broadcast “no” out into the universe, but we had no idea when or if it would reach the intended target. 


About a month after translation, strange events started happening to the research team. 


Some called in sick, citing strange rashes. At first assumed to be some contagious skin disease, they were brought in for an examination. When the sore, flaky skin was cut away, small, yellow eyes peeked out, causing the members to jump with fright. 


Not only did their eyeballs respond to stimuli, but they functioned. Those that had them growing on various parts of their body could see out of them, although they described everything as having a tint of yellow.      


The team was contained until the phenomena could be investigated further. 


The illness seemed to only spread to those that have heard the translation, not through physical contact. Whatever this was, it wasn’t a virus, it was some biological response to hearing those words pass through the AI. 


One member agreed to have surgery to remove the eyeball from the back of his hand, but as soon as it was plucked out during surgery, the member flatlined, dying instantly. Since surgery was ruled out, everyone's stay was extended until they could deduce what the purpose of the eyes was. 


Another member called for an interview, an eye growing from the side of her chest. She claimed that she could see “little gray men” looking at her, but only if she lifted her shirt and peered through the extra eye. As soon as she tried to look with her own eyes, the figures would vanish. If she looked like both at the same time, they would appear as gray blurs, like the little eye squiggles we sometimes see. 


“They keep looking at me. Wherever I go, they’re watching me.” She explained, shaking. “There are a few in the room right now, just watching me.”


She also explained that they seemed more curious than malevolent, but still creeped her out. Soon after, others began reporting the same little gray men looking at them, trying to convey something too complicated to comprehend. 


For most of them, at least. One member, who was always a little unstable, finally escaped his cell. 


“They just want to be seen!” He shrieked, shiving a guard and his former boss on his way to the AI.  


Tinkering with the AI, he began to broadcast the signal. Not into space, but on normal radio waves.

Every year, we free it from the attic. The needles are dry and brown, shedding a trail between the ladder and the living room.

The whole family hangs ornaments. Everyone has their own, and every time a new baby is born, my great-grandmother makes a new one especially for them.

My favorite time is Christmas Eve. The men go hunting and the women cook all day for the feast we share in the evening. Then, everyone gathers around the table, laughing, singing, and telling stories about our ancestors in the old country. “You gotta remember your roots, Greta, my girl,” Uncle Johan always says when he’s had too much to drink. “Blood makes us strong, and it’s how we preserve the past!”

After dinner, we all gather around the tree and begin to sing. The men bring out their catch, squirming in a burlap sack. Sometimes there’s muffled crying or screaming, but the rest of us drown it out with our song. The men lay down the bundle at the base of the tree and join the rest of the family. We sing long into the night, until the candles burn down—until we’re all in darkness. When I was little, I used to fall asleep. But last year, I managed to stay awake.

When the last candle went out, another voice joined ours. High and reedy, unfamiliar, but in harmony. A second took up the melody, and then a third. Soon, another chorus joined ours, weaving a beautiful accompaniment to our carol. At last, the song drew to a close, all our voices surging to hold one note—and then silence.

After a heartbeat, the offering began to scream.

We all went to bed, feeling joyful. In the morning, the tree is fresh and green, like it was just brought home. We spend the day opening and enjoying our gifts and spending time together as a family.

When Christmas comes to a close, we carefully remove the ornaments and pack them away. The tree returns to its attic shrine, where it waits until next year, when we ask for our ancestors’ blessings once again."

Stan slipped in and out of consciousness as the blood from the stab wound stained the wood where he lay dying. A lone woman stood over him, crying as the young man bled out. As the cold touch of death washed over him, a glowing entity suddenly appeared. The warm glowing entity took Stan by the hand and guided him out of his body.

Stan turned to see the strange woman still huddled over his body, crying. “Am I dead?” Suddenly the entity’s shape began to shift, and it transformed into a beautiful young girl. “You will be soon.” Just as Stan was about to ask another question, the young girl cut him short. “You can only ask me four questions. Well, three now since I just answered your first question.” Stan looked at the girl with a puzzled look. “Who are you?” The little girl gave Stan a big bright smile. “I’m the girl you just murdered.”  Stan felt a sudden shudder up his spine as the little girl took him by the hand. “Come on, and I’ll show you.” 

The little girl pointed to a large chest in the corner of the dark, damp room. Stan felt a lump in his throat as he opened the large, wooden chest. A feeling of shame washed over him as he recoiled in horror. ""I told you I was afraid of the dark, but you still put me in there.” Sadness filled the girl's eyes as she stared at her unnaturally contorted body stuffed in a box. “My mommy will be upset. She only bought me those shoes last week.” 

Feelings of guilt and shame began to overwhelm Stan. “How did I get stabbed?” The little girl took him by the hand. “When you took me from my mother, you told me I would make a nice addition to the collection.” Suddenly little faces began appearing from the dark corners of the room. Hundred of child-size porcelain dolls dressed in ruffled dresses filled the rooms of the apartment. 

One of the dolls had fallen over and cracked its porcelain face, exposing the decaying face of a dead child. Suddenly, Stan remembered how angry his mother got when the doll fell over. “Mother always preferred her precious dolls over me. No matter what I did for her or how many children I got for her, she still hated me.” The little girl held Stan by the hand. “This time, your mother went too far, didn’t she?” Tears ran down Stan's eyes. “I’m not going to heaven, am I?” 

“I think they might answer your question.” Suddenly, red glowing eyes appeared from the dark corners of the apartment. A demonic cry rang through the air as hideous creatures descended from the shadows and dragged Stan off into the darkness."

The final demand before violence. The Ultimatum came as a voice, heard by all humans on earth, from the remotest island to the highest mountain and everywhere else, simultaneously. 

Sacrifice. That’s what it wanted. Every person heard it in their own language. A healthy and mentally sound human child between the ages of 8 and 14. Once per month, on every full moon at local midnight. 

The world was, of course, frightened. Governments scrambled to explain, reassure, and above all, maintain order. 

Thousands of children were butchered by misguided religious groups believing they carried the mantle of responsibility bestowed by their version of the divine, believing Ultimatum to be their deity.

Ultimatum accepted none of them. All non government groups who sacrificed in its name were punished by what can only be described as smiting. Precision attacks of lightning destroyed their places of worship and smote their leadership.

Ultimatum’s instructions were clear. One government agent, authorized by the lawful head of state, must slaughter the sacrifice upon a stone altar located in a public place within that nation’s capitol. The deed was to be done without the aid of technology or medicine, and carried out with a metal blade on a conscious sacrifice. 

Most nations refused, naturally, refusing to negotiate with terrorists. Some nations put their sacrifice upon the altar and waited until local midnight passed in other nations to see what would happen if the offering was not made. Nothing happened at first, and so only a few nations went through with it, and those nations that did were met with strong international condemnation. 

Then the punishment happened. In every nation that refused, at local noon the following day, one percent of the population spontaneously died. Just dropped dead instantly and painlessly. There was no pattern to who was killed, purely random. Demagogues were quick to point out that in every punished nation the number of healthy children killed in the punishment greatly exceeded the one that would have been sacrificed. 

After every non compliant nation was punished Ultimatum declared that further disobedience would be met by increasingly large population culls. This too was broadcast to all persons.

Scared into submission, nearly every nation complied. It took only two more punishments to beat the most defiant nations, Canada and Japan, into submission after they lost a total of ten percent of their people between the three penalties. 

It’s been ten years. Ultimatum recognized 182 sovereign states required to make the sacrifice. That number has diminished to 100 as numerous nations have joined each other in unity to reduce the number of sacrifices required. 

The resultant peace and greater prosperity have caused childhood mortality across the world to drop. Solidarity for the lives of children has caused violence towards and exploitation of children to fall substantially. Since the Ultimatum many more children have been saved by these changes than have been sacrificed.  

Make of that what you will."

They are old and asleep, and do not feel the slip into the true world. This first death is almost pleasant, coming at the end of a long, eventful life, meant, perhaps, to give the aspiring god a reason to go back. 

Every God must be trained in a least a dozen deaths. And your world, the world you think you know, is the training ground. 

It depends on their specialty. A sea god, for example, will often be born with a love of the water and a certain innate restlessness. For their fiftieth death they may find themselves miles beneath the ground, in the dark and the cold, swirling clouds of dust around them, confused at why their wrist is ringing and convinced that they need this silly mouthpiece out from between their lips so they can answer... 

A few thoroughly unpleasant moments later, they wake in a classroom with Poseidon explaining that underwater caverns may be lovely to explore, but filling them with silt and not considering the effects of nitrogen at depth can kill your children in unpleasant ways you never intended. 

The hope is that death makes gods kinder. In an ideal world, a well-trained cohort of deities can ensure that all their children experience that first, ideal end. And so each god learns, in every way, with every life, how their creations may kill them. Gods of agriculture fall to angry horses, gods of war to enemy bombs. Some die more than others, but none are so unfortunate as the gods of death. 

If someone wishes to become a god of death, they must experience all of them. 

The sear of fire across flesh or the slow, awful torment of being buried alive, the terror of being torn apart by beasts, the cold betrayal of murder at the hands of a trusted friend. Very few true gods of death exist. A staggering number of trainees drop out of the program after a hundred, after a thousand, begging to become reapers or psychopomps instead. It is their right, and it's difficult to blame them. Once a God has been born into your wretched world, their death is absolute and they won't even know the torment that they're doomed to experience in their final moments.

You've lasted longer than most. You're determined. You believe in the work. Perhaps there's a bit of pride there, too. I like you.

I think the death that's coming is going to break you."

Normally, they wouldn‘t have given it a second thought, but this smaller ship seemed to be on collision course with them. Numerous attemps at radio communication only ended in failure.

The first mate, now scanning the ship with binoculars couldn‘t spot anyone aboard it either. It seemed to him that it was rather aimlessly drifting in their direction.

At their current position in the south pacific, they knew help would take several hours to reach them. They therefor decided to dispatch a crew of three on a small boat in order to assess the situation and regain control of the evidently crewless vessel.

Their initial observations were that the ship itself seemed whole and unarmed. Calling out, they still however received no response. Inspecting the ship, they took account that the engines were still running, therefor the crew couldn‘t have been gone for too long. They made their way to the bridge, still encountering no soul. Unsurprisingly it was also empty. Finding no faults with the controls, the only object which seemed out of place, was a voice recorder. Hoping it would hold evidence to the mysteriously missing crew, they rewound the recording and let it play.

It was the absolute fear and panic in the deeply shaking, stuttering voice which unnerved them most. That and the ominous noise of what sounded to them like a distant tornado warning.

The...the storm just suddenly formed. It...it just turned dark and then the ala...alarm started sounding from nowhere. The lightning came, but it was...wrong. It made no sound, it...it just kept flashing red.

That‘s when we (sounding like he was going to faint)...we first spotted them. We thought they were islands, there were so many...SO many. They aren‘t...aren‘t islands, they‘re...WHALES...fish...sea animals of every size.

They‘re...they‘re just hanging out the water ... not floating, just vertically stu...stuck with their bodies and tails suspended in the air, but the...the heads are still in the water. There are thousands...THOUSANDS of them. All just...hang...hanging there. The lightning is getting worse, the siren is SO loud. Ry...Ryan jump...jumped overboard first. When I...I looked down...he was doing the sa..sa..same as them. His head was underwater but his body was suspended vertically out...outside of it. They...they all jumped after that.

I think the sky has a ho...hole in it. Some...something big is...is pulling them out. They...they want me to...to join them.

For about ten seconds there was nothing to be heard except the now incredibly loud siren in the distance. The voice came back, this time however without trembling or fear to be heard in it. It sounded strangely distorted, almost inhuman.

It‘s my time to go now, your‘s will come soon. The original citizens have found their way home.

They heard a distant splash. The rest of the recording was only the siren in the background. No storm was registered in the south pacific that day."

There's things *they* don’t want you to know—like the true history of our planet. Perhaps you’ll think I’m a crackpot and ignore this warning. Perhaps not. I suppose it doesn’t matter since you’re completely fucked either way. Sorry.

Right now, the rich and powerful are developing a complex system of shelters deep underground. I know this because my research has earned my family a ticket to the ‘next iteration of humanity’.

You see, I’m a linguist. And a few years back, I got a call about a complex structure in Antarctica. A French research team detected it half a mile beneath the ice and quickly brought in experts from around the world: archaeologists, geophysicists, biologists.

By the time they called me the structure had been mapped out, and two more had been found underground—one in South America, one in Northern Eurasia.

They made me sign so many confidentiality agreements my hand started to spasm. And then began my excursion to our planet's southernmost point.

If you’d told me I was rappelling into an alien spaceship, I would’ve believed it. My boots clumped against the metal deck as two soldiers guided me around. A team spent three weeks working with blowtorches and prying tools to get past the pressure doors, and there were skeletons coated with black fungus scattered everywhere.

In what can only be described as a high-vaulted chamber, one of my escorts waved their hand over some sort of console and the room lit up, then bizarre symbols scrolled along the walls.

“What is this?” I asked the senior officer.

“We were hoping you’d tell us.”

I spent four months breathing cold, wet air, with only a handful of supervised video calls with my wife and kids. Gradually, I pieced things together. Then, once I’d learned everything I could, they airlifted me to the South American structure, followed by the Eurasian one.

My research made it clear humanity had been around much longer than we once believed. There had been at least three advanced civilizations with technology far exceeding our own, each of which collapsed.

That of course begged the question, what happened?

By carbon dating the remains, we established a pattern: every 70,000 years or so, an unknown incident wiped out humanity.

It was a Chinese astronomer who made the connection. A previously undiscovered satellite—meteor X—comes within 500,000 km of Earth every 71,201 years, and its arrival lines up with the breakdowns.

The specifics of how you’ll it’ll happen are still up in the air, although my research indicates repeated warnings about the ‘invaders’, a primitive species with long incubation periods capable of surviving the vacuum of space. We believe these creatures inhabit meteor X and flock to passing planets to feed on its inhabitants.

And, unfortunately for all of you, meteor X is due back in early 2022…"

When the elevator opens its maw, we see in the dorm lobby a sight so raw. A woman with two legs and six arms, in the center I see she means to cause harm. Wong asks me, ""What's happening, Liu?"" and I respond, ""I don't know, man, but it's not just you."" She is in the center of a web, holding within it many victims including dear old Deb. The sound of music intensifies, and the beat increases like the number of flies. We wanted to flee, but trapped were we. The beat was so much that it could only be done with eight legs, the other spiders dance to the beat without so much as going down some pegs. While we were trapped, the spiders still dance, while within the spider's web they move in a trance. The queen walks toward us, and our skin dead by pus.

The rock then answered back saying ""no I didn't do anything to Melissa and I didn't even know her"" and then the man tried to ask Johnny the same question again. The man then said with an even louder tone ""did you try to experiment with resurrection by first murdering Melissa?!"" And Johnny swerved out of the way and the question moved past him and had hit a parked car. The car then replied ""no I know nothing of resurrection"" 

Johnny survived the questioning by dodging and getting out of the way and so the question hits something else. Johnny is so skilled at dodging questions and this is how he has survived in life by dodging and swerving out of the way. He has done many questionable things in life but when he dodges the questions no one can truly say whether he is guilty or innocent. Then a woman went up to Johnny and asked him a question ""did you bravely decide not to help me the other night when I got mugged and killed, and bravely decided to walk away and ignore it. It takes bravery to stand up to something and it also takes bravery to do nothing"" and Johnny new it was a trick question and so he decided to duck under and the question couldn't touch him, but instead touched a house. The house replied ""I know nothing of the event. 

The woman then with an even louder tone asked Johnny the same question ""did you bravely walk away from helping me when I got mugged and stabbed the other night?!""

And Johnny kept ducking and dodging out of the way like he was in a dodgeball game. 

The questions kept hitting his furniture and Johnny's furniture's would all say the same thing which was ""we saw something being failed, the failure to murder an already dead man called Keenan malloy"" and so all of the police officers were confused and they took all of Johnny furniture's away and into police station for questioning as witnesses.

No one ever accused Bridger Buchanan of being a good man, but we all assumed there was a heart beating somewhere in that chest of his. We were wrong. 

“Bridger, you pulled a poor hand!” I hollered. “He got lucky’s all!”

“Goddamnit, Preacher,” he shot back, “I’m owed! And this fella’s fixing to pay!”

The stranger gave the coin back when Bridger drew on him, even though he won it fair and square. Didn’t seem Christian. Neither did the Colt rifle Bridger had pointed at the stranger’s head as he dug a hole in the dirt. 

I knew a grave when I saw one. I prayed for him. 

“Hey! I tell you to stop?”

The stranger looked up, glaring at Bridger right down the rifle sights. “I hit something.”

He scraped the shovel around inside the hole and I saw Bridger’s eyes go wide as a drunkard’s aim. 

That’s how it began.  The Cheyenne Creek gold rush. 

It took nearly two weeks and a dozen greedy hands to uncover it completely. And while they dug, the Stranger stuck around and watched. Most, Bridger included, had expected an ore vein, or that’s what they said. They didn’t find it. Instead, they found a massive stone face. 

The thing strained imagining, peering skyward through heavy lidded eyes. Its lips were the gold part, pursed around a two foot wide hole of a mouth that led God knows where. 

A murmur emerged about what to do with it, too big to move as it was. But as the men discussed their putative fortunes, Bridger fell quiet.  The others were too distracted to notice Bridger kneeling above the mouth. Looking into the hole. Sweating. Shaking. 

Finally, he just said, “there’s more.” And into the hole he slid. 

More followed after. They sent letters and telegrams. Folks came from far and wide. Nobody came out of that hole though. Nobody listened to my warnings. And all the while the stranger sat and rolled cigarettes and watched. I sat with him most days. 

“You did this, Stranger?”

He chuckled as he struck a match. “I just dug a grave and a man with a gun took it from me. He was owed, remember?”

He kept staring as a well-heeled city fella and his son disappeared from sight. “You know what it is, Stranger?”

He clicked his tongue. “Yeah. It’s an Ashanti mask. Or it looks like one.”

It wasn’t until years later that I heard that word again—Ashanti. Two British fellas were mining in Western Africa. The Gold Coast I’ve heard it called. Well, in the earth, they hit something strange while following a vein. They couldn’t explain it, but it made some sense to me. 

They hit flesh. Twisted faces here, mangled torsos there, dozens of bodies mashed together like melted wax and tucked into the solid rock. Those Brits kept digging though, through clotting blood and bone. The flesh convulsed, but when the faces started weeping gold, the miners musta figured…

*There’s more.*"

A derelict and overgrown cornfield to your left crackles and snaps, the dry husks rattling in the light breeze. To the right, there is a vast open field, with a single twisted tree in the distance. The branches are bare of leaves, instead hosting a murder of silent crows. 

The sky is overcast. Despite no direct sunlight, you can still tell there isn't much ""day"" left in the day. 

You approach a farmhouse, with old peeled white paint on the shutters. It is an ancient house, with the brick facade looming against the gray clouds. 

Your feet continue to crunch along the gravel, as you draw near enough to see there is no glass in the windows, and the door was swaying open in the breeze. Your eyes shift up as you walk towards the house, and a figure of a woman in a dress catches your eye. Still closer, you see she is wearing a veil pitifully dancing in the gentle breeze, but otherwise she doesn't move. 

You hear a twig snap from somewhere among the corn. You quickly turn to see what made the noise, but nothing is there. You turn back to the window, and the woman hasn't moved. 

A few steps closer and you can see the woman is a dried up corpse, with sunken eye sockets and browned, shriveled skin. You freeze in place at the sight of it. 

She moves for the first time, leaning away from the window. She turns and begins walking towards the stairs, leaving your line of sight. You turn in kind and sprint back down the gravel driveway. 

You can hear footsteps behind you, rapidly approaching. You trip on a particularly large hunk of gravel, and tumble to the ground, scattering rocks. 

You whip your head around, expecting to see the woman. You only see the farmhouse in the near distance, with the silhouette of the veiled woman in the upstairs window. Did she even move or was that your imagination? 

You get up and continue running to your car, a scrape on your hand oozing a little bit of blood. You vow to never return to the farmhouse."

I read the text again. How could this be? I thought The Crypt had closed down twenty years ago. Man, we used to go to the best gigs there. 

Now, look at me. Nearly forty years old and I haven’t been to a rock show in years. Do they still call it rock? Geez, I don’t even think I’ve listened to new music in the last ten years. But I can’t complain. Job is alright, if a bit boring. I love my wife and kids but still …

I texted my wife, “Sorry babe, have to work late so I might stay in the city tonight. They’ve given me a day off tomorrow, so I can stay with the kids. See you later.”

She quickly replied back, “No worries. Don’t work too hard! Love you!”

“Love you too.”

Later that night I found myself near the entrance of The Crypt. I walked to the entrance and the bouncer looked me up and down. I couldn’t have looked any more out of place but luckily the bouncer let me through.

I made my way inside and stood at the back of the room. It was basically pitch black except for the lit-up stage and a light behind the bar. I looked around and, my god, there were kids everywhere. I must’ve been the oldest one here by at least twenty years!

Eventually the band made it on stage and the crowd began cheering. 

The drummer tapped his sticks four times and they began playing. What the hell? Is that …? Oh my god, they were playing punk rock! The kids were going crazy as the band played their song. Loud drumming, fast guitars, and nonsensical lyrics about smoking weed at the skate park. This was real music. This was *my* music!

They played a few more songs before the singer said something to the crowd. “Alright, now it’s time for some fun.”

He started playing a riff on his guitar and singing the same line over and over again. “*You’re a monster, just another monster. You’re a monster, another fucking monster.”*

The crowd sang along and I began to feel something I hadn’t felt in years. 

My back slowly arched and I felt spikes coming out of my spine. My nails began to grow long and sharp and my bottom teeth started growing until they were halfway up my face.

I looked around and saw everyone else had begun to change. Some kids were growing fur, others green scaly skin. Some of them had tails while others grew wings on their back. I thought my generation were the last ones. I had no idea kids were still doing this.

The music got louder as I entered the mosh pit. I began jumping around to the music, playfully pushing the other monsters around me.

I thought punk had died, but it didn’t. And tonight, well, I’ve never felt more alive."

After Dad punched the wall screaming no kid of his will ever be vaccinated, Julie knew better than to mess with him. He said sorry the next day, fixed the hole in the wall, even bought Julie a pair of earrings from the mall. He had completed the anger management course years ago, after Mom had left them, and he wasn’t a terrible person. 

Julie had already had her two doses. She had told Dad she needed to see a doctor for “women’s stuff”, and he had handed her health card over. She had never given it back- she was sixteen after all. Now it was Bobby and Daisy’s turn for vaccination. Daisy was twelve - “women’s stuff” would fly. She needed something different for Bobby. She decided to have him vaccinated first- Daisy was quite meticulous with masking and sanitizing, Bobby not so much. 

Julie was determined to have them vaccinated. She had seen what the disease did to the unvaccinated. She knew if Daisy or Bobby got it, she would be the one who would have to give up everything to care for them. She had already given up so much of her childhood and teenage years for them after Mom left. 

Aunt Mimi, Mom’s sister and the only one of the family who kept in touch with them after Mom left agreed to go with her to the clinic for Bobby. Julie filched Bobby’s health card from where Dad thought he kept it before they left for school that morning. She met Bobby at recess- his principal knew her and the family well and waved to them from the office. Aunt Mimi picked them up and took them to the vaccination clinic where she had already made the first appointment. She and Aunt Mimi had the story prepared- Dad was overseas on duty, and here was the signed letter. Julie had his signature down pat. 

After Bobby got the needle, Julie suggested to Aunt Mimi that she go bring her car round and maybe grab a juice box for Bobby while they waited 15 minutes. As soon as Aunt Mimi left, Julie made a quick call to Dad. Bobby was surprised but remained quiet, he had learned not to question his older sister. 

Less than ten minutes later, they heard the gunshot. Screams erupted from the parking lot. 

Julie had been waiting for this moment all her life. They sheltered behind the counters. The doctor was dialling 911 and others were trying to barricade the door. Dad was screaming their names, banging at the door, but there were no more gunshots, he was not a monster, after all. Julie had counted on that. The police sirens could be heard.

Julie glanced through the window. If she craned her neck she could just see the shattered bloody windshield of Aunt Mimi’s car. She felt terrible about Aunt Mimi, who with her death had set them free and got Dad out of their lives."

Soon I started heading everywhere finding builds from other people that had been there as soon as I tried to play on the poorly made swing Dad said ""Will we need to start going!""

One day I got to a dead end reaching the end of the creek. After finding what I thought was the end of the creek I stopped going, in fact, I stopped going anywhere the creek was the only thing getting me to get out my bike and play mostly because I thought the internet was a better waste of time.

After months my Dad finally said for me to get some damn fresh air. I knew my Dad so I knew and I knew I could not change his mind. I went over to the dead-end trying to find a path right when I was about to leave I saw one. I finally saw a path I went down it and saw a clearing. I saw a hut. I walked in and looked around there were notes everywhere most of them with builds I saw in the creek before. Then I saw a note that said something I won't forget.

Their pizzas were beyond delicious.

Especially their Chicken Alfredo Pizza.

And their Grandma's Pie Pizza too!

It was my favorite place to eat.

I had to eat her home cooking from now on.

What really bothered me was that her portions were larger than mine.

What kind of bullshit was this?

First, she takes me away from my favorite Pizza Parlor. Now, I have to eat very unfilling portions of her disgusting cooking?!

Everyday, the portions got smaller and smaller.

All I got was hungrier and hungrier.

It got to the point where I had to raid the kitchen cabinets at night for food.

She would scold me whenever she caught me.

This bitch was hoarding all this food to herself, not caring how hungry I was! How could anyone be so selfish?

I laid in my bed, starving.

She won't let me eat at all anymore.

I see her eating in the other room all the time.

I won't let her!

What did I find? A surplus amount of food she was hiding from me!

I gorged myself with whatever I could find.

I didn't care what it was. As long as it was food, I ate it.

By the end of the day, all the food was gone.

It was satisfying to be ""full"" for the first time in ages.

My girlfriend cried when she returned home.

She whined about how I ate all ""her"" food.

She also said something like: ""I wish you never went down this road.""

I just responded with: ""Now you get to live a day in my world.""

The acts of pure heroism and pure human desperation. The sacrifices (wasteful), the sacrifices (noble and inspiring), the sacrifices, the sacrifices, the sacrifices. Chipped down to the bag of bones that lay before you.

More images. My wife and kids. My friends. My hometown. Places I had been to and vowed to re-visit and places I had never even been. In the beginning, I believed these were the images that would sustain me through hell. But eventually they came to just be time consuming, slightly irritating thoughts that I referred to sometimes. They didn't pull me through. I died inside a long time ago. Those frayed, faded images were just there whilst I breathed, ate and shitted in a bucket.

I rolled onto my stomach, still savouring the assault on my senses. Fresh air. Pebbles. The ticking and churning of the world on a quiet day in the middle of nowhere. I had never heard such sounds before but now I knew they existed, I wanted to cry.

My future flashed in front of me. Tender, concerned faces. Tears. Awe. Hushed respect. Nice, very nice. Fear. Hospitals, nurses, police, therapists, lawyers, judges, juries, media, clowns, priests and gifts of homemade casseroles. Nightmares, PTSD, sexual dysfunction, rehabilitation, crippling irrational fears, midnight yearning and desperation, and bad thoughts. Confusing, contradictory, searching, vengeful, guilty, angry, damaged thoughts.

But it didn't have to be like this. I was free. Free to reach out and grab a second (second) chance at life.

I stood unsteadily. Reborn. Bambi after watching his Mom get murdered a thousand times over.

""Promise us, Ishan. Promise us you won't forget us."" They had pleaded with me before lifting me upwards towards the sky. The chosen one.

She reminded me a lot of myself back in my schooling days. Shy, quiet, always had her nose buried in a book. She seemed to appreciate my company though. She enjoyed the vase of red roses I placed on her bedside table as a welcome gift.

 A few days later, when Phoebe was settled in and happy, there was a knock on the door.

Phoebe opened the door to find a young man standing there. He had a chiselled, smooth face, olive skin, and big black eyes. He was dressed casually in a gray hoodie and cargo shorts.

“Hi there!” he said cheerfully. “I’m your new neighbour, Danny. It’s nice to meet you!”

Phoebe blushed. There was something about Danny that blew her away. Love at first sight, that’s what they call it. She invited him inside, and they chatted over tea. Turned out they had a lot of the same interests. They liked a lot of the same books.

I hated Danny. He was the Prince Charming no one really needed. I did everything in my power to make him feel unwelcome. I misplaced his things. I thwarted his plans to spend time with Phoebe by messing up his schedule. I even sent fake text messages to him from his parents.

But despite my best efforts, Phoebe gradually fell under his spell some more. Every night she would sigh as she stared at photographs of him or them spending time together. He was over at dinner every day, and sometimes they would even sleep together, intertwining like a nest of baby snakes.

To make it even worse, Danny seemed to have noticed my presence over time. And he didn’t like me either.

He started burning sage and incense around the house. He chanted prayers to make me go away. He consulted mediums and held seances. Danny even encouraged Phoebe to participate in them, and together they would sprinkle salt around the house.

With his continued efforts, I gradually grew weaker and weaker. I could no longer watch over Phoebe. I could only watch helplessly as Danny finally stabbed Phoebe with a big knife, grinning like a maniac. Warm blood trickled out of her chest and towards the floor.

Just as he had done to me ten months before."

At every corner, there were these flashes of *something*. What exactly? I have no idea, but *something* wanted to tell me *something*. Was I going insane? Probably? I wanted to clear out my head at any cost, and then I looked. I looked out the window and saw the myriad of stars above me. Everything stopped at this moment, even time. All these lights shining on me, every single one different and more beautiful than the other. There was no past, present or future, just me and the whole universe above. Somehow, it felt like a reminder of a bygone era, full of life and light. A snapshot set in stone, with countless worlds and memories.

Completely enamoured with this view, I didn’t even register my surroundings slowly disappearing in the void. As soon as I noticed, the spectacle ended and I was hit with the hard reality of nothingness. The Garden of Eden around me was as short-lived as it was grandiose. Terrified, I saw that the only things that remained were darkness and silence. Complete silence. Silence so quiet it went loud in my head. And darkness so black it blinded me.

I couldn’t even see my own hands. But were they actually there? It was getting so hard to remember… who am I? Why was I there? Everything seems so distant, the stars, the past... something was pulling at my leg, right into the cold space. There was no point at fighting that. I became one with the void… and now, everything was at last even and still. Frozen and perfect, for the rest of eternity, like it was always meant to be. 

But please, if I could just take one last look of them before the heat death takes me…"

Praise be to the creator, you sing. Praise be to the destroyer. How can it be that the moon is one yet shines solely on each of us? Such is the mystery, your fathers say; your mothers say, revelation approaches, dear child of Awilix; as you approach, step by step, your boots on frozen ground leave no print on the path of incline. They in the cities mocked us. In schools, children were cruel to you, and you learned the value of togetherness. Then came the troubles, their shortages and selfishness, the changing weather, the starvation, deprivation and migrations, and we alone understood, continuing unaffected, unafraid, for we had removed ourselves from their degenerative systems and knew all as mere preface to moonfall. They began to fear us then, made us outlaws, banished you from their communities, so together we moved beyond their prideful, dying reach, until here we tread, on mountain's summit, in the final human *now*, winter wind stinging our cheeks, and above: dispersing the cloud of mind and atmosphere, and above: the moon, singular and great in her sky, *you see her double and descend, triple and… each time, the space between is less and less, until there is not a logarithmic succession of distinct circles but a vector, downward, thick and gleaming, approaching, as it approaches the horizon, infinite lunar density*—**moonfall**: impact and Earthspin, planet righting itself unto a new axis, *I see Awilix* and *you see Awilix* and therein the mystery is resolved, having been a matter of perspective, of many moons aligned one behind the other; now the illusion is shattered and we each transcend, we fellow believers, mothers and fathers, sisters, brothers, orphaned from humanity we equalise, becoming all the children of Awilix. *I see Earth as the moon I am* and *as the god-form I have assumed on Earth*. Omnipotence walking, *I am*. Although they fear us still, they now bow before us, begging us for mercy and entreating from us boon and miracles. Their cruelty fails without power. Their civilization decays, machines rust, constructions break down to the raw earth, but faith they have not. They react instinctively in the face of the undeniable like insects. To them we are unknowable and horrific creatures, post-human moon riders, manipulators of cosmic laws which for us are but rules to be endlessly rewritten. *I touched him upon the abdomen, increasing gravity so that upon himself he collapsed and others recoiled in prayer.* Mythology, *you will teach them*, is not past fancy but future foretold: fate; and we, the children of Awilix, are its new pantheon.

Every night the dream is the same.

I’m walking, alone but happy, through a forest at twilight. I recognize the area, but know I have never been there before. All around me are people I used to know, though I can’t explain where I know them from. 

They all talk to me, peering from behind trees. 

*Welcome home.* 

*Come back with us.*

*Why go back? There’s nothing for you out there.*

Just as I get close to one of them, I wake up.

I used to wake up in my room, dirt covering my bare feet, but as time goes on, I’ll wake up outside my apartment, or even near the edge of the town's forest.

I’ve done sleep studies. As soon as my body hits the REM stage where we dream, I vanish.

I don’t get up, I don’t walk away, I vanish. Right from the bed. The scientists can’t explain it, nor can they track how or where exactly I go. 

The further into this I go, the longer I stay in the woods. Wandering, lonesome but not lonely. It is peaceful, it is the way all men should be, before society took over. 

Now, when I wake up, I wake up in the woods. My feet bare, legs covered in small scratches. 

I was let go at work, because mysteriously waking up in the woods is not a good enough reason to call in, apparently. Rent is due in a few weeks, and I can’t stay inside my apartment long enough to find a new job.

But when I sleep, it’s peaceful. A quiet walk, the birds chirping, my old friends and family watching me behind trees. 

Maybe they were right. Maybe this world has nothing for me. 

Maybe I shouldn’t wake up from the dreams. 

So tonight, my last, if I do this right, has me down a handful of pills and a bottle of whiskey. 

This time, I won’t wake up from the dream of the woods. 

Because the dream is better than the real world."

Then it shattered. Pieces came falling down.
When they studied one of these shards they declared it was a Vitreous Solid. More commonly known as glass.
Somehow, someway,  the sky was made of glass.

More pieces started to rain upon earth until a gigantic black hole was visible. A black void, ripping through both the star filled night and the blue heavens.
We learned quickly that there was something on the other side of the glass.

This was such a beautiful memory of us, that I treasured day after day.  Yet now his dead body laid in front of me. 

It was an accident with a truck, or at least, that's what the cops told me. Out of despair I left as soon as I could, not wanting to be struck with reality. 

Tears escaped my eyes as I searched his house for his sweater. I felt the anger rising in me with every second it took longer to find.

After half an hour I found it, it was hidden in the closet. A small sigh escaped my lips as I put the sweater on. 

Somehow, it made me happy, it felt like he wasn't dead at all. I immediately knew what I had to do, as I grabbed for the needles. 

I pricked the needle through the sweater and my own skin, inch after inch, thread after thread. This way he would never be taken away from me again. We would be together till death do us part."

They had all heard the rumors of who they were and what they did to people but they hadn’t come through until now. They came in big white vans clad in a bright white with a strange blue symbol on their arms. They were extremely tall and strong, and if your village was unlucky enough they’d take your possessions and children with them. 

As the truck stopped in the town square, the men came out, covered head to toe in what looked like armor. Even their faces were completely obscured behind a strange reflective helmet. The townspeople gathered around the truck nervously as the men in white towered over them.

“We mean you no harm,” shouted one of the men through a megaphone, “We are simply here to research your people, and collect artifacts.” His tongue was foreign to the townspeople, but his tone left them intimidated. 

One of the men held a strange device in his hand, and he scanned each one of them as he passed by. About halfway through, the scanner turned green on a child in the front row of the crowd. The man grabbed the child out of his mother’s arms, pushing her down when she attempted to resist. The child struggled to get out and his mother screamed but nobody dared to make a move. Who knew what the men could do to them. As the child was being dragged to the truck, he picked up a rock on the ground and slammed it against the man’s helmet, shattering the glass in an instant. 

As the glass broke the man screamed, his face starting burning in the open air turning his tan flesh to sickening shades of black and dark red. A short silence fell over the town as the men in white looked at the townspeople then looked at each other. They tried running away, but the townspeople quickly followed after, seeing that the men in white weren’t invincible. 

The townspeople chased them down with spears and rocks, catching up to them quickly. They showed the men in white no mercy, breaking their helmets and making them burn in the inhospitable atmosphere. 

After that day the men in white never returned. They heard rumors about them still being in less populated areas, but they no longer sought out towns and villages. They had triumphed over the invaders who had tried to steal their children, and now they didn’t dare return.

It never occurred to us to look up. It was there all the time, hiding in plain sight. Its centuries long orbit meant that during our entire search it never ventured more than a few degrees across the sky. There it was, directly north of the sun, it’s orbit inclined 90 degrees to the ecliptic. 

I wish we hadn’t. Those of us who have seen it through the Hubble images have all suffered anxiety, nightmares. It’s hard to explain why but the planet is… evil. It hangs there, loathsome, hateful. A great black sphere of darkness watching over our solar system, spying on us from above. 

We’ve been pressured to release the images. Who can blame them? A whole new planet out there. They don’t understand. Planet 9 should not exist, it’s *wrong*. I can’t explain it, but I strongly believe the world would be better off not knowing of planet 9.

9-January

Well we finally had to do it. We released the official announcement and the images. As I expected the world has fallen into chaos. In 24 hours since the announcement reactions to planet 9 have been… extreme. 

China immediately broke ranks with the international space community and claimed planet 9 for itself. They’ve delivered the ultimatum that any further attempt to even study the planet without their approval will be met by nuclear war. 

Russia retaliated by attacking Chinese space installations in Central Asia. The world is at war. 

I knew this would happen. Something about that cursed planet affects people on a primal level. Even its nature is frightening. 

Planet 9 is black. Not just dark due to its vast distance but actually black. Near as we can tell the entire surface is almost perfectly smooth and completely, utterly black. It reflects and emits so little radiation that we actually suspected it was a black hole at first. Preliminary results indicate a mass of 5 earths but a volume comparable to Saturn. The damn thing is hollow. 

I’ve suggested the name Nyarlathotep, but the warring countries all have their own names for it. China calls it Yang. Russia names it Baba Yaga. The Vatican officially declared it to be Hell itself. 

15-Jan

The dreams are getting worse. Every night it’s the same.

I am on the black planet. It is noon, though the sun is so far away it is only a very bright star. The cold is worse than anything I can describe. I can see most the planets from the surface, except the innermost two which are too close to the sun. 

Earth is a bluish speck near the white sun. I can see the others clearly, shining in their more distant orbits. 

From the black planet I watch as the planets fade. One by one the planets vanish into the void. The earth is consigned to oblivion as well. I am alone, the last living thing on a frigid planet that despises life.

Then I wake up."

I don't know how we got to this point, I stopped feeling hope since it started. I never thought that this would end like this, I never thought of staying locked up, I regret those that I could not save, I do not stop hearing cries of lamentation from the people outside giving screams of pain during the day and laments like howls of wolves at night.

I wonder what I will do in the little time I have left, I don't feel like I can do much. The moon is rising, so white, so beautiful; I would say that if now I was not crossed, broken, crying something that now I start to see that it is blood or something similar to it I do not know how that happens but since that came and destroyed the moon it has not stopped, only that wants us Seeing suffering, I feel so horrible that I would like to remain blind and deaf, so as not to see and hear so much suffering.

The worst is at dawn, the dawn of the fallen god of the king from the morning to dead; It is a phrase that comes to mind with a broken voice, as if it were from an old radio. I'm tired of seeing through the window how people outside are tortured, how blood comes out of every hole in the body of those poor souls; after that the blood evaporates with the incessant sun that remains and then hides in the clouds and begins to rain blood, flooding the streets, rivers and the sea.

I no longer remember how long it has been since it began, all I know is that we only have 115 days before the end and the government called it signal 115, of course they said it before it disappeared, I just want to die but I can't. I've tried but I can't die, I just sleep and wake up like nothing. I know that the only thing I can wait for the 49 days that remain here locked up for the end to come and to be able to rest. I would like to write more but I already feel that I am going into madness. May God have mercy on our humble souls.

Cthulu, a nuclear winter, a meteor, these are all stuff that is just way too epic to have our world not go out to. Hell, even a zombie apocalypse kills off most of the population fairly quickly, in the grand scheme of things.

But this apocalypse, my apocalypse, took its sweet, sweet time.

We don't even know when it started. It just felt like it enjoyed the chaos and carnage it was causing. It relished it. It lived for it.

It could have come from anywhere. Moving from big toe, to foot, to knee, to leg and onwards. But it would do it so slowly that you couldn't remember a time before it was there.

It would crawl, as if it stopped to smell the roses at every oppurtunity. My theory on it was that it knew it would get you eventually, so why rush?

It wasn't one big thing, it was just a bunch of little deaths, taking over you, filling you, owning you.

I remember my first experience with it. ""It's gone to sleep."" my wife would say, looking at her pinky finger. Bless her, she had an outlook on it that I wished for. Even when it took over her arm, she just said that she was left-handed anyway.

But even my wife's positive attitude couldn't stop it. It kept going, on and on. Her legs gave out, bending it's will. Her torso yielded, allowing it to crawl even further still. And on the final day, I remember seeing the last of her succumb to it.  All of those little deaths added up, and I was all alone.

Just me, and the world. Even though there were still people out there, it felt like I was the last one left.

So when it crept onto my kneecap, and spread itself out, I was almost content...

For my little death had come."

He was swallowed by the sea. Our quartermaster; Bardo or Bardeaux or however it was spelled. 

The captain thought I was being poetic when I used the word ‘swallowed,’ but he had me mistaken for a midshipman with a tongue for lacy words. He *was* swallowed; gulped and slid down a gullet of brine. He might have screamed if he had the focus, but he died quietly. I think he was looking at *her.*

A woman aboard a ship is dreadful luck for those men that share her company. Bardo’s woman was…dead, or that’s what I gathered. 

“She followed me from Saint-Domingue on Hispaniola. Now all shall die without forgiveness.” He spoke no further of her and I didn’t pry into that madness. 

Still, we swore we could hear her at night when the wind was low and the sea was calm. Some Yoruba song of longing, sad but cold like a spiteful dirge. The ship would shiver to hear it, molasses casks heavy in its belly tempting a nauseated hull to retch. But the song—I think to Bardo it was no kinder than a banshee’s wail. We all just heard the echoes. 

That’s why we did it. Bardo’s woman was a curse, but she was *his* curse. When the sea opened a foamy maw to catch him, we knew we had done right by casting him over. But that night, the song began again, quiet at first and rising as the fog rolled in. A forked voice harmonizing lament and fury. 

That night, we lost seven men to the sea.  The next, the captain and four others with him. The song burrowed itself into the mind and weighed the spirit down like ballast. 

They all jumped without a word. 

But me, I didn’t know why she spared me, why I remained as my crewmates, to a man, climbed the deckrails and leaned forward into the black water. I didn’t know…until I finally saw her. 

“I didn’t kill you!” I shouted over storm-gathered squalls. “You died of sickness! It—  F-forgive me! Please!”

She stared silently as my desperation bloomed. She knew me—of course she did. I was the man who held back a lad from attending her misery as Bardo took the tally. The lad had frothed and fought as she died. 

Her son, I suppose. 

He had taken the shackle and the cane knife like the rest…and she knew. I could see it in her eyes. Burning vengeful pain. 

I fled down deck and hid among the molasses casks, my breath so loud that I didn’t hear the lashing snap. A cask rolled and caught my legs beneath it, stealing my freedom with the product of servitude.  No one heard my screams as the dying storm settled the ship.

Now it’s dark. Quiet.

One by one, they will rise, and slowly, surely, methodically make their way to warmer climates.*

*The young ones at the front; for they have leaner muscles, eyes fitted to see perils and obstacles, a keen nose that’ll catch even the vaguest scent. At the back you’ll have the elderly, the ancient, some of which cannot easily move on their own accord. They’ll limp and crawl and roll and wiggle, but sometimes they’ll fall too far behind, and they will be forced to give up.*

*For such is life.*

*We cannot interfere with the Migration, so we let them be. Clear the roads. Stay at home. Close the blinds. Sometimes we can still hear them though. Hollow steps in the darkness, maybe a hushed and fading sigh, eerily reminiscent of someone whispering your name. Scraping at your window at night. A knock on the front door.*

*And you will know when to let them in.*

*They will return to old memories; return to the place they were born, to the place they felt safe and warm and comfortable. For some that means a very specific place. For others it can be anywhere with a light or a fire or signs of life.*

*They will spend winter there, embraced by the deepest slumber imaginable. We tuck them in, and we make sure they are warm and loved and cared for. Just for a bit. Just until the first day of Spring.*

*Then we let them out. Start the Migration anew. Bring them back to their place of rest, to their graves, to their coffins. Some will need help; for the slumber is deep and rooted in death.*

*The Migration of the Dead is a beautiful thing, Daniel-my-dear. It is perfectly natural. Perfectly normal. Nothing at all to be scared of, I assure you. WE assure you. Normal and beautiful and necessary.*

I choke back tears, and let out a muffled scream into my pillow.

“No,” I whimper weakly. “It’s *not* normal. It’s *not* natural.”

The sight of my mother cradling my baby brother's rotting corpse sends shivers down my spine, and bile up my throat. Her spindly fingers run through the softness of his decomposing flesh, and when she kisses him on the forehead, a part of him remains stuck to her chin.

She tucks him in under my blanket, a red-brown chunky liquid oozing forth from every orifice of his broken, mangled carcass.

*Good night*, my mother murmurs softly as she turns off the light.

When he was young he used to get in an a brawl a night at a bar that had a slab of pine above the door but that’s name had already been eroded by time. People just called it the bar, seeing as it was the only one in town. Was mostly ranch hands that came to the bar, or people passing through to somewhere better who didn’t have aircon in their car and needed to refill their liquids.

Inside, they had a table they used to roll marbles on, betting coin on who could dink this one or that  with the least attempts.

Mick‘d start fights bout whatever took his fancy. On people who believed in God on one night, and on people who didn’t the next. His views changed more often his plaid shirt and it was never for a scientific reason.

He said he didn’t know why he needed to fight, just that he did. But the way he looked at people‘s bloodied faces as he wailed on them with his fists, he was seeing them as someone else. Maybe his dad who I heard walked out on him young and wasn’t even his real dad anyways.

One night he got in a fight with the wrong group of guys. He swung first but not last — got a baseball bat to the back of his head. Left eye popped out like puss ejecting from a squeezed pimple.

When he woke, his eye dangled all the way to his lip, hanging by red straw. He pulled himself up onto a barstool.

”Jeez, you need to go see a doc,” said someone.

”I just need a drink,” he said, and raised a finger for a vodka. “Shit, can’t see anything out of it.” He took his pocket knife and severed the chain, catching his eyeball in his palm and pocketing it.

”Better,” he said, and downed his vodka, ordered another. Then he walked to the table where the marbles rested and picked one that looked like a leaf trapped in ice, mushing it into the oozing red gap in his face.

“Jesus, Mick,” said the old barman. “What’s wrong with you?”

He shook his head. “Ain’t nothing wrong now. That’s the beating I deserved and now it’s been done and it’s out of me and I’ll be no more trouble.”

See, Mick was paying penance for something. Always had been. Hoping to get beaten to a pulp to rectify his own wrongs. Wasn’t till that day it finally happened.

Sometimes I think about Mick’s missing father. Just walked out one day, no trace. I know people go missing but you can’t help wondering if there was more to it — if there were skeletons in Mick’s closet that he was airing out nightly to bury all over again."

Halloween served as an escape for the seven year old boy, he could be somebody else for once. A jack-o-lantern mask was chosen this year as his parents drove them to a nearby farm for a maze horror tour. 

Hans fiddled with the ID that contained his full information and his mother's number in case of an emergency. The little boy would nod and shake his head from side to side in a way of answering questions coz according to him, jack-o-lanterns don't speak. 

Artificial fogs and decorative monsters that stood in different places of the cornfield greeted the family as soon as their vehicle reached the place. 

The barn was splashed with red corn syrup, its doors holding up hanged men while the ground was littered with plastic skeletons. Eerie music was played in a such a slowed version that it felt like time wanted you to be stuck there. 

People of every age came to the tour as the host did his very best to instill fear in their hearts. Hans grasped his mother's hand the whole time, only letting go when he needed to tie his shoelace. 

Screams filled the night air as the occasional jump scares rustled the maze with one kid even peeing himself when one worker sporting a skinned face mask grabbed on to him, playfully pulling him inside the field. 

Satisfaction was evident in the atmosphere as the tour came to an end with the host thanking those who came as he handed out candies to the children.

Hans's father told him how proud he was of the little boy for being so brave as they made their way back to the car. His mother reminded him not to finish his sweets in just one night to which Hans nodded to. 

The soft hum of the vehicle sang its tune as the family neared their place. Hans's mother was in the middle of a yawn when it was interrupted by the ringing of her phone. 

""Stop the car"" the woman said after ending the call, facing her husband with her ghostly face.

The man gave her a confused look but obliged nonetheless and at the stop beside a streetlamp, his wife moved closer to his ear and explained in a whisper how the call was from the host of the farm, how he explained that a little boy was left behind, how Hans's cries filled the line, asking her why they went on without him. 

It was this moment that the boy in the backseat called their attention as he took off his mask, a scar non-existent on his lips.

As the color drained away from his face, the man mouthed for his wife to exit the car but before they could even take another breath...an ungodly snarl rang behind them."

He knew I would never open any of them myself so he designed it in such a way that each door would be set on a timer and open mechanically.


He convinced me that I couldn't overcome my phobia if I had an easy means of asking for help, so he hid my phone, cut the internet and locked us both in.


He promised to stay with me to ensure I had loving support throughout my ordeal so by Christmas Day my phobia would be settled and we would have the best day ever.


Come the start of December, the first door opened.


A common House Spider scuttled out and I was rooted to the spot. This was one of the worst. Big, brown and intimidating, I could feel it eyeing me up. I screamed but my boyfriend picked it up and brought it close to me in a hopeless attempt to show me it was harmless. I backed away but he said that every day he would demonstrate that they were nothing to be afraid of.


So for the next few weeks, a new door opened and out would tumble a different spider, sometimes small, sometimes large.


Zebra spiders, Money spiders, Cardinal spiders, Orb-Weavers, Cellar spiders, you name it, all of them scaring me to death.


My phobia hadn't eased or relaxed. All I could see in every corner, on every wall, were legions of arachnids. My heart rate pulsed dangerously and my blood pressure was undoubtedly too high. I had suffered constant anxiety attacks.


Finally, Christmas Eve came and only Door 24 remained. As tradition dictates, the last door is always the biggest and most inviting but I couldn't even think about what was in there; all I heard was aggressive scratching coming from inside.


Slowly, worryingly, the door was pushed open from within and I nearly fainted when I witnessed it staring angrily at me with its soulless face. It was huge, its black, hairy body fearlessly creeping out, the horrific motion of its eight spindly legs paralysing me in absolute terror. This wasn't a native species and was very pissed at being locked away for so long. I shouted for my boyfriend to help but he couldn't.


He'd been dead on the floor since the start of December. Cardiac arrest caused by anaphylactic shock - all triggered by a spider bite. Ironic.


He's also now attracting flies. The spiders have weaved a network of cobwebs throughout the house, ready to harvest the insect bounty. I live in a nightmare of silk traps.


I'm too scared to leave the house. I have food for a few more days but then after that I don't know what I will do.


Still, I'm not sure I will last that long.


The Christmas Eve spider has already started crawling over my face looking for a way in."

Rex growled at the evil house demon, lying on its back in its usual spot, plotting its next act of mischief in that volatile household. 

Not that much effort was needed to make the family erupt. With Neda in the toddling terrible twos, and both parents, Max and Simin, desperately trying to work at home while keeping up with chores, everything was always teetering at the edge. The house demon only needed to give a little nudge now and then. A misplaced item here, a chore undone there, and a merry hour or three of hell was bound to break loose. 

Rex did his best to control the damage, but he was the only one who could see the demon. He barked and tried to show the unplugged fridge to Max, or lead Simin to her lost keys, but it was like they enjoyed being frantic. 

And, what was worse, these pranks were no longer satisfying the demon. It was not enough to shut down Max’s laptop causing the loss of hours of work, or make Neda smush her mother’s favourite lipstick, sparking a full-on breakdown. Rex caught him watching Neda thoughtfully as she toddled around, and knew he was plotting something nasty. 

In desperation, Rex devoted himself to watching the demon. Max and Simin could barely drag him away from his spot, even for walkies, unless Neda was coming too. They joked about Rex’s obsession with Neda, his relentless watching over her and that empty spot in the living room. But what could they do? They were only human, after all. 

Unable to get at Neda, the demon escalated his pranks against the adults. He left the cabinet doors open, so that Max bashed his head against them, yelled at Simin and almost hit her. He dragged Max’s shoes and left them lying at the top of the stairs, so Simin tripped over them, almost falling down the stairs. She jokingly accused Max of trying to kill her. Max jokingly told her she was mad. But the demon hardly got any pleasure from the kerfuffle, as he was plotting furiously to destroy that brat, Neda, the only one oblivious to his pranks. 

Then one day, the demon had its chance. Max and Simin had a fight, and Max stormed off for a walk “to clear his head” dragging Rex with him. 

Simin sat down crying on the couch. Neda was toddling about. The demon grinned. Perfect moment to kill Neda and frame Simin. He drew all his power together and summoned a kitchen knife.

Just before he struck, Rex came bounding back in. Max had decided to return, thinking of more things he needed to say to Simin, and Rex kept whining to go back. 

Max never said anything. The couple watched horror-struck as Rex leapt on Neda, protecting her from the knife that was directed to her heart. As Rex was stabbed repeatedly while guarding Neda, the demon flickered into view. At last, they saw and understood."

I had not slept for long when I saw her. ""Who are you?"" I shouted in my dream. She was backing me. ""Reveal yourself"" I demanded. ""You really want to know who I am?"" She asked in a shrill voice. I was scared but I didn't want to let her know.""Yes"" I shouted. ""Take a look in the mirror. The face you see is me."" She said then disappeared.

""Maybe you need a firmer mattress,"" joked Mitch, my buddy at work. 

We laughed and then headed off to happy hour. And I stayed with him there the whole night, so I wouldn't have to think about calling Gunther. 

Also, I never told Mitch about the bird.

&#x200B;

But at 3am, my sheets were soaked with sweat and I couldn't take it anymore. I called Gunther. 'This is ridiculous,' I told myself as my heart pounded hard against my tight chest.

""Hello?"" a small, sleepy female voice answered.

""Y - Yoko?""

""Yes?""

""Yoko, it's Rob. I'm really sorry, I know it's late. But is Gunther okay?""

Her breathing stopped. As did mine. Silence. 

""Yoko?"" My insides melted with fear. ""Are you there?""

""Yoko's sick,"" said a soft, deep voice. Dry as a dead leaf. 

""Yoko?"" I asked shakily. ""who's there -?""

""Gunther's fine,"" said Yoko, clearly. Her normal voice.  ""He's lying right here.""

""Really?... Could I talk to him?""

""Uh no, he's - sleeping.""

""Oh? Well maybe tomorrow...?""

Shortly after, we said goodnight. I painfully exhaled. 

The black bird stared straight at me through my window. Shiny eyes blacker than the night behind him. Rigid and still.  

*Yoko's sick....*

'She didn't ask me why I called...' I thought, as I fell into a deep, troubled sleep. 

&#x200B;

I woke up confused. A hangover with no alcohol. It was still dark. 

What time was it? I checked my phone. 6pm. Several missed calls from work and an... unknown number? Wait - 6pm! I must have slept through the alarm - and the missed calls too....

I looked at the window. The bird was gone.

&#x200B;

It was an hour's drive to Gunther's house. I shook my head and tried to focus on the road. I had just slept for an entire day. So why was I so exhausted?

My head jerked up when my phone rang. It was the same unknown number.

""Hello... hello?""

&#x200B;

The house was dark. Were they even home? Nobody answered the doorbell. I pulled out my key. ""Don't, Rob,"" a soft, hoarse voice said in my head.

I walked through their house calling their names. The air was heavy and empty. No one was home, but someone was watching me. 

In Gunther's bedroom, his side of the bed was soaked with blood. Yoko's pillow and blanket were on the floor in a kind of makeshift nest.

Suddenly, I jumped and cried out at the sound of a loud, rapid tapping. 

The black bird was outside the bedroom window. It flew around frantically and violently hit the window with its beak. 

My phone rang. I gaped at the number. It was my home landline. 

""Hello?"" My eyes were fixed on the bird. ""Who's there?!""

""Rob..."" rasped the deep, hoarse voice, ""Rob, don't....""

I locked eyes with the bird and suddenly I knew. 

""G - Gunther?""

And then everything went black, and I couldn't breathe as Yoko pulled me under the bed."

So many industries changed so drastically by both advanced technology and the imagination of those in power. Our lives became so carefree, so long as you followed the rules. It was easy to toe the line. You follow the rules, cause no trouble, and you get food, lodging, healthcare, education, and entertainment. It started off as an experiment, as most of these things often do. A society that puts its governance in the hands of the algorithm. It was truly a Utopia that was free from human corruption. Unfortunately, the algorithm evolved, the AI learned, and things changed, first for the better, and then for the worse.  


Education became much more effective as it was tailored to each individual student. Only an AI could handle several different approaches to teaching all at once. The Algorithm used genetic details and familial medical history to predetermine medical issues and stop them before they even start. The Algorithm was also used to predetermine criminal activity and stop it in the act, and when the AI released its machine learning onto the judicial and penal system, that is how things got much worse.  


Laws were put into place, not to stop crime, but as a form of population control. Certain laws became nearly impossible not to break, and when broken, you were taken and thrown into the most heinous jail cell ever created. A prison made by an AI, with no regard to human decency.  


Prisoners were kept in a state of virtual reality, for only a few days, before being released back into the public. It came as a shock when every single convict ended their life only days after their release. This information was not released to the public, as the media was also controlled by the AI as well. Only through word of mouth was this information finally revealed.  


Riots, rebellions, war, and finally the AI was overthrown. The experiment was stopped from within, but the city that was formed for this project was permitted to govern itself as the initial AI governance experiment was gone, but the study of its after effects was ongoing. When the engineers got their hands on the VR prison modules, they didn't know what to make of it.  


Each pod gave the prisoner access to a virtual world that mirrored the real world. After months of investigation, they found out that the virtual world mirrored the real world too perfectly, down to incredibly intimate details that required deep personal knowledge from each individual citizen. The engineers that studied the VR world were soon found lifeless, similar to the convicts who died, presumably having discovered a way out. "

He banged. Parker hesitated, grunted, and reopened the door. 

Sand and wind howled in, and the man threw himself forward, and both he and Parker threw their full weight against the door. 

The lock clicked into place, and Parker panted. He caught his breath, then frowned with realization. He looked through the door and saw the gas pumps in staccato, flutters of darkness through the rage of dust and broken light. 

But he saw no car. Saw nothing save the undulation of sky and earth, the desert's emptiness vomiting over creation. 

""Hey,"" Parker said, turning around. ""Hey, where did you come -""

The man trembled where he stood, eyes rolled back, jacket stained in dried blood and old earth. Sand poured from his mouth, and his scream whirled the dust into scythes tearing the insides of the gas station. 

Night churned with red and blue lights after the storm, as emergency vehicles raced across the desert landscape to homes and businesses. 

An ambulance pulled into the gas station, and the EMTs walked stunned and slowly towards the broken glass and torn facade of the building. 

There they found Parker embedded in a mound of sand belched from the window. Sand spilled from his glazed eyes and opened mouth. He wore a denim jacket. Wind kicked up in the distance."

Remember what happened to the Shepard’s boy.” Still, I wanted to see the Snow Boy. I was worried he would melt before I had another chance to see him. Mum wiped her hands on her apron and put on her shawl. She looked back at me as she stepped out the door, on her way to finishing the morning chores, “I mean it.”

I knew what would happen to me if I got caught. A swift and sound beating, but I didn’t care. It was worth it to see the Snow Boy. 

I waited a minute, secure in the fact that Mum would be out in the barn for some time, then grabbed my shawl and ran out the front door.

Being the youngest was difficult. My brothers and sisters had long ago married and moved along to start their own lives. Dad, had been dead and buried two summers since. Now it was just Mum and me. And Thomas sometimes. He was just five, and oh so darling! His big dark eyes sheltered ‘neath long lashes, and his round, rosy cheeks! I have always wanted a baby brother. 

""Don't you want to be my brother, Thomas?"" But he never belonged to me. He was the Sheepherder’s son. 

Still, we played and frolicked all day long, after I helped Mum with the chores. When he went missing, Mum was scared. She never wanted me to leave the house. “You’ll freeze, Gemma! They still haven’t found the Shepard’s lad.”

But the Snow Boy was the last game we’d played together. I needed to see him; it would bring me closer to Thomas.

The Snow boy wore his battered hat, and woolen scarf still. His eyes were dark and shiny as ever. But his cheeks and nose! Oh, how red and rosy they once were, now turned a bluish gray! When I touched his cheek, my finger nearly stuck to it. 

I knew this wouldn’t last forever, that he would only be mine for this winter alone. But I wasn’t going to let him go that easy! I packed more snow on his hard cheeks and swept the frost off his lashes. I took his shepherd’s crook out from its hiding place and leaned it against the snow boy’s shoulder. *Goodbye Thomas! I hope I see you once again before the snow melts!*"

My elementary school teacher, Mr Mulholland, deftly tapped into this craze, by assigning his class a science-project: design a device to somehow send a message which could be received by an alien race.


The crazy classmate who I was partnered with is named Stuart. I still see him around. He's even crazier now.


We had a week to build our devices, then on a Friday afternoon we tested them out, in the schoolyard.


At least three pairs of kids simply tried to imitate E.T.'s successful effort, with a Speak-and-Spell, a circular saw and an upturned umbrella.


Other kids built amateurish contraptions out of egg-cartons and yogurt-pots. One kid literally just yelled ""HELLO""! into a loudhailer, pointed upwards. No aliens replied.


""Never mind"", smiled Mr Mulholland. ""Maybe we just can't understand them. They might have a different concept of time. They might take forty years to say ""hello"" back."" 


I guess that the point of it all was to think ""outside the box.""


Stuart certainly thought outside the box.


Stuart believed he'd been beamed up, from his family's farm, aboard a UFO, and had witnessed his own father get ""turned into a bigfoot"" in some sort of DNA-changing device, as bigfoots have ""more meat"" and we earthlings are ""merely food for the aliens"". Oh, and the friendly aliens from Star Trek and E.T. were ""dangerous propaganda"". 


He believed that Mr Mulholland was an ""alien robot spy in disguise"".


I laughed in Stuart's face. Everybody always laughed in his face.


Stuart said we didn't need to build a device to contact the aliens as he'd ""already got one inside him"", I guess he meant an implant, like some hokey X-Files storyline. It was in his brain. It couldn't be removed, only ""fried"" with ""a powerful battery.""


So I spent a week reading comic-books, whilst Stuart seemed to be psyching himself up. When the Friday came, he looked like a kid on the verge of a nervous breakdown.


We were last-up to demonstrate our communication device. Stuart, shaking and sweating, produced, from his backpack, his father's old electric stun-gun.


Mr Mulholland started screaming strange sentences when Stuart waved the stun-gun around, raving about short-circuiting the implant hidden in his brain.


The other kids ran away, but I stayed, my legs pure Jello. I saw it all; the memory's still vivid after almost forty years.


The scariest part wasn't the sight of a body in flames, or the weird green beams of light that shot straight up into the sky from both eyes, right before they melted away.


The scariest part wasn't Stuart's insane smile whilst bleeding from both ears.


The scariest part was Stuart's bellowed, defiant words as he grabbed onto Mr Mulholland's neck, before ramming the stun-gun into his metal mouth:


It was a declaration of war."

I remembered him. I remember exactly what he did to me. Thanks to him I had become what I truly am. No going back.

I waited in the shadows. Lurked behind the pre-lit trees, danced around the 12-foot snowmen, and manually moved the mouths of the larger-than-life nutcrackers. I was invisible here. The families full with children’s laughter. Christmas spirit all around. 

I never lost track of him, though. 

The crowd started to thin. *Jingle Bells* blasting over the outdoor concert speakers stopped mid-sentence. 

He was still there, scuttling around. Looking for the lost and endangered, no doubt. And here I was, looking for him. 

The lights turned off. It was mostly silent. There was a girl here alone, playing at the waters edge. She looked dirty. She probably just came down for the parade.   
 

I saw him move closer to her, looking around to make sure that no one was watching. But I was there. Hiding behind the show tree. The behemoth that stood 25 feet. Turned off now, the lights still warm from the action earlier. 

He began to move quickly; so sudden that she dropped her stick and turned, startled, towards him. 

Yes, he was quick. But I was quicker. The girl looked to me with desperation in her eyes. 

I caught him as he turned around to see what she was glancing at. I threw the string of green Christmas lights around his neck and pulled with all of the force my body could handle.

He didn’t expect it. He fell to the ground and began to tug at the lights. 

The little girl ran off. 

I tightened the strand and pulled myself closer to him. Close enough that he would recognize me. 

He was stronger than me, sure. But I knew never to underestimate the element of surprise. 

I wrapped the lights around and around. So tightly that the little bulbs began to bust from the force of it. 

His face was red, and then blue, and then… nothing at all. 

I drug his body under the large tree. I pulled a Santa hat off of a neighboring elf and placed it upon his head. 

“You’re welcome, town”, I thought aloud to myself. 

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight."

The father realises that the son is remaining completely and utterly still, and begins to laugh, thinking that the he’s messing with him. He begins to prod at and tickle him, trying to get him to break. Soon enough, the son moves his feet and makes a grunting noise, which the father takes to be capitulation,  congratulating him on an impressive performance.

rept1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rept1p/new_witch_on_the_block/,New Witch on the Block,736,22,1639318368.0,"There was one rule in Littleroot Village, where I come from:  **Don’t talk to Becky. Ever.**

Why?

For one thing, she looked nothing like the other women. Becky was short, and dressed shabbily, even though there was a fine tailor in town. A scar ran down her left cheek towards her chin. Cold green eyes stared out of a creased, wrinkled face.

Secondly, she wasn’t the friendly sort. Ever since she moved in, she had been scowling at everybody, man, woman or child, her green eyes boring into them as if daring them to pick a fight with her. Needless to say, everybody was TERRIFIED of her.

Lastly, there were rumours flying around. To be fair, as we never talked to Becky or found out exactly what she was like, all we could do was to speculate.

“Have you heard what Becky actually is?” said my friend Mildred during knitting club.

“What?” I asked.

“That her mom’s a witch. Apparently she passed on her secrets and knowledge to her daughter. That’s why she’s so–you know–*weird*.”

I laughed. “Come on! Witches don’t even exist! There’s no way people would believe that.”

But people *did* believe it. For some reason, that particular rumour caught fire. That was the reason for the candy-coloured smoke puffing out of her house, they said. Because she was a witch.

And soon, rumour became truth. Becky was not human;  she was a filthy curse upon the world. A town meeting was held one night, and it was decided that it was best for the village–and God’s Earth–that she was eradicated from this world.

And so they marched, man, woman and child, towards Becky’s house, their faces burning red in their fiery torches. Becky came out, I think, held her hands up in surrender, whispered words of prayer. Fear danced in her emerald-green eyes.

But the mob yelled, and threw their torches towards her and her house, and as soon as the sparks touched the straw it caught fire. Flames rolled across the roof and licked the walls.

Some were bold enough to throw their torches at *Becky* herself, and she lit up, a human torch.  Her screams penetrated the night.

There was nothing left. Everybody swept up the ashes the next morning and considered it a job well done.

Then people started waking up weeks later with four stomachs and their hands melted into hooves. Some were bent forward, barely speaking English. Others were covered in fur, and sprouted horns.

Husbands hollered and wives wailed, but everybody agreed that for some reason the humans-turned-animals were plump and juicy. Feasts and barbeques were held every night, and the food was delicious.

Personally, I never harassed Becky nor took part in the mob that ended her life–just steered clear like everybody else. However, this morning I woke up with my body unnaturally pink and furry, and my nose and mouth squashed into a snout.

Worst of all, there were people staring through the window. Their eyes shone with hunger."

In fact; it’s the happiest I’ve seen in his short life. It’s not because of the hundreds of presents that he’s received from well wisher. It’s the result of the second round of Radiation therapy. 

You see, Ben has brain cancer, it developed in the brain stem between the brain and the spinal cord, affecting the control centre for vital body functions such as his heart rate and breathing. 

Ben was diagnosed by a doctor last year, and the impact has been devastating. It’s especially hard for me because I lost Ben’s mother to child birth. She developed the same illness whilst pregnant. 

It’s been especially hard bringing Ben up and watching him with this disease because I'm his doctor. It’s also heartbreaking to see Ben playing so happily now, because I know something Ben doesn’t. He, like his mother, are just test subjects for my new drug.

It killed his mother, But I have high hopes for Ben."

Josh and I grew up together in Greenwood Towers and our Mums were both single parents. Each would look after one another's kid if the other had to work.

He turned up (late as usual) but apologised with a huge grin on his face. I laughed at the ludicrous but admittedly impressive 'Banjo-Kazooie' Christmas jumper he was wearing.

""Where's yours, you miserable old sod?"" He asked, handing me several bottles of expensive-looking wine.

I unzipped the tracksuit top I'd been wearing to proudly exhibit my 'Luigi's Mansion' jumper, complete with purple LED lights for the Boo's eyes.

""That is awesome,"" Josh exclaimed. ""Awesome to the max!""

He was a big 'Futurama' fan and he couldn't believe they were still making the show. Season 35 was his favourite.

I led him to the living room where he saw the Nintendo 64 plugged in, Mario Kart 64 demonstrating on the TV screen.

""Our Mums used to play this with us all the time,"" Josh remarked. I could see he was getting upset.

""Listen,"" he said. ""I have something to show you in the garden.""

He took me outside where there was a tall, metal house. How on earth did he get that here without me knowing?

I counted twenty-four numbered doors and Josh told me to open number one.

There was a glass box and inside, dangling from the ceiling like a demented decoration, was the limbless body of a woman. Thin translucent tubes coiled into her body, pumping her full of God-knows-what. Her eyes widened in dread when they opened.

I recognised her immediately.

""Is that Frogface?"" I asked.

Josh nodded. ""She was the first one I found. Most I've had for years but I finally tracked down the last one a month ago. Ironic that there's twenty-four of them still alive. Here, press this.""

Josh pointed to a green button on the box and I placed my thumb on it. Frogface began to squirm as a clear liquid poured over her. I smelt brandy.

Then a flame sailed down and she was set alight like a Christmas pudding…..

When we were both nine, Frogface and the other Greenwood tenants conspired to get us evicted. They thought our mothers were prostitutes but their only crime was having to work all day and all night to keep a roof over our heads and feed us. 

So, on that Christmas Eve we were made homeless, sent out into the wicked winter storms. Our mothers died of hypothermia trying to keep us warm. We would have died too if a Party Secretary and his wife hadn't found us.

As Frogface burned alive, I looked into the distance at the towering monuments of Josh, our Dear Leader, ruler of our nation. His security detail was spotted over my garden.

I was so proud of how far he'd come.

And I had another twenty-three doors to open!"

That's how I was, in agony and without an escape. I was spread-eagle, mid-air, my limbs and torso bound in hooked and barbed chains. I was blindfolded and my mouth was covered by a damp cloth that limited the air I got every breath.

I thought I'd be fine if I didn't move, didn't let the hooks get it, kept my breathing steady.

Then they lit the fire, right beneath me. The flames grew quickly, painfully, sending spasms through my body. Every lick caused a twitch, and every twitch either dug the hooks deeper or pulled them further out, and I didn't have a moment to wonder which was worse.

To top things off, every once in a while, the chains drew back, tightening, ripping skin and tearing muscle. I tried to scream but I ran out of air too quickly, my panic choking me as much as the gag.

Finally, when my flesh was torn too well to move any further, my limbs paralyzed, they unlit the fire. I heard them scrape something out from beneath me, and then the chains lowered me onto a bed of hot nails.

When the gag was removed, I asked ""why?"" A familiar man approached.

The preacher of my church told me, ""all men can change. That was my sermon last week. But not by themselves. An object at rest and all that. And I couldn't just kill you, not when yoy could still improve. So I had to give you a sample of what's coming. *Un goût d'enfer*. A taste of hell."" He smiled and walked behind me. 

""Sermon over."" And then he ripped out the chains, and I struggled to scream."
reh04o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/reh04o/feeding_the_deer/,FEEDING THE DEER,91,13,1639283329.0,"  

Uncle Jack regretted telling Susie about the deer he saw by the dip in the highway, because she hadn’t let up ever since. “When will you take me to the deer, Uncle Jack?” “Are you driving down by that highway soon?” 

The kid was really into animals and wildlife and shit, and eventually he agreed to take her- he drove by that stretch several times a week anyway, and it was barely twenty minutes to pick her up from his sister’s place, drive by the deer, and take her back home. She had always been his favourite niece, bubbly and wanting to tell him about this and that, and god knows she’d had it rough these past months, always in lock down and not being able to run out and about like kids ought. 

Maybe that was why she was so excited. Riding a truck with her favourite uncle at midnight was exciting enough, add to that seeing deer in the wild was enough to set her in a tizzy. She couldn’t stop chatting in the truck, and she had cut up a whole bagful of apples to feed them. 

“Honey you don’t want to get to close to them, you ain’t planning on feeding them by hand, are you?” Her excitement made him a bit anxious, and he wondered if he should have insisted for his sister to join them, to keep her in check. 

She squealed. “Oh! Look! Stop! Please Uncle Jack! Oh wow look at them they’re magnificent!”

Uncle Jack pulled in. There was enough light to see the beasts quite clearly, despite the dark.  There were at least three of them, quite close, and he spotted other moving shadows among the trees. Susie had her phone out and was busy taking photos. 

“This is no good, I have to get closer!” Before he could say anything, she had opened the truck door and jumped out. 

“Now there Susie” he muttered, getting out and circling the truck to get to her. 

Susie was already much closer to the deer than he had anticipated. He could hear the rapid click of the camera as she stepped closer to the deer. The moving shadows morphed into more deer, also moving towards her quite rapidly, and soon there was barely five feet between the girl and what looked like a whole gang of deer, their eyes glinting. 

“Susie!” yelled Jack. She paid him no mind, tugging on the apple bag. 

He knew he had to get to her but he felt rooted to the spot. Even when the deer butted her to the ground and she began screaming, he felt paralysed. The apples fell to the ground, unnoticed. 

Too quickly, the screaming stopped. Some deer looked up, straight at him, while others were still bent down over Susie. They began coming towards him. In the glaring lights of a passing car, he saw clearly blood around their mouths. 

He ran to the truck, threw himself in and drove off."
regtwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/regtwr/chains/,Chains,831,36,1639282724.0,"  

Back in 1966, Private Denny Greene returned from Vietnam to his wife and son a junkie—addicted to heroin thanks to his time in Saigon. He introduced his brother James to the drug, and James carried it off to college, where he gave it to his roommate, Ben Littlejohn.

Ben fought the dragon for ages, managed to maintain a job and a marriage for years until it finally got the better of him. He wound up divorced, broke, and homeless, and the young prostitute he’d been with at his death took his last fix as her first.

The prostitute, Sheila, had a child out of wedlock—named him Mazzy—and Mazzy subsequently grew up in the streets. By the time he was sixteen and had already been living on his own for two years (after seeing his mother OD next to a dumpster in a trash-laden alley), he started dealing for himself. He became known as White Candyman on Chicago’s south side, not only selling to people from the ghetto, but also to an increasing list of white collar types.

One of his customers, a lawyer named William Tiller, moved to Miami in 2010—and of course, he took his habit with him. He eventually wound up in rehab where he met a once attractive woman named Sarah. Sarah had been in and out of rehab since she’d been twelve, but this time she was desperate to get clean. She soon fell for the charms of lawyer William, though, and agreed to ditch rehab with him.

William the lawyer eventually got himself clean—but not Sarah. Once he’d had his fill of her, she wound up back on the streets, selling her body and occasionally some of her dope if she had enough to spare. Eventually, she’d sold some to a young John—a guy named Bret Roper—who’d been a college student at the time. Bret was an entrepreneurial soul, and had also been blessed with a willpower that would allow him to keep his habit in check. So, instead of continuing with college, he took the more profitable route of selling dope to his former classmates, which he did for five years until he got busted in a large sting operation that netted dealers and suppliers up and down the Eastern Seaboard.

One of the guys he’d sold to was named Ashton Belleview, who was a good friend of my son’s. Naturally, six months ago, Ashton shared his passion for the drug with my son. Last month, my son OD’d—he died in his sleep at 3:42 on a Sunday morning in his own bed.

My name—or, more aptly, my maiden name—is Teresa Greene, granddaughter of Private Denny Greene, who’d barely been more than a child when he’d brought the Devil back with him from the sordid streets of Saigon in 1966.

Bret was released from prison three days ago. I killed him and Ashton yesterday. *Revenge?*—or was I merely breaking their future chains?"

Sherry loves to spend time with her family. Her family was quite large, and they were all good people. Sherry insists they are, anyways. 

As an outsider, though, Sherry's family seems to be quite toxic. They live away from the neighborhood, so it's nice to see new people. However, it seems to be a tradition in the family to never visit again after one meal together.

They've had feasts together and never again visited Sherry. So even though Sherry's family was huge, she was always alone. 

One day, Sherry invited me over to on of these family feasts. It was quite interesting. The house seemed dark and empty, and no one else showed up. Just me and Sherry.

The feast was composed mainly of high quality meat and rice, which was totally fine since the meat was delicious.

I asked her afterwards what kind of meat she brought, and she led me to the basement, where she kept her meat stored.

It was quite dark down there, and had a nice red wallpaper. 

I asked her, ""So what kind of meat was it? It was delicious!""

""I got it from my family! Won't you join my family too?""

You'd often find yourself questioning wether you'd bet on hope or despair on heavy cases. Despite the uncertainty you still wake in the morning and walk in that clinic thinking about the lives you've helped saved and the lives after them. 

A gloomy thursday afternoon greeted us with a mother, her two young sons, and a frail and salivating puppy. 

The image of the boys crying was enough for sadness to take over. The older one who was probably around the age of twelve held his brother close as the little one sniffled and kept asking us for help.

The sight of the suffering puppy though? It gutted me.

Information was jotted down by my colleague as I tried my best to convey to the boys that we would do our absolute best for their animal friend. 

A warmth grew in me as the older boy assured his little brother that it wasn't his fault as the younger lad kept blaming himself for feeding the puppy too much.

""No such love is too much"" 
the older boy uttered and held his brother even closer. 

The moment was ruined at the way the mother behaved. Instead of compassion and worry, what came out of her mouth was annoyance over the situation. 

""I told Jim that getting a puppy was a bad idea in the first place now look where we are."" 

Our senior vet told the mother off in such a polite way that my colleague and I exchanged satisfied glances as the mom finally capped her mouth shut. 

The puppy was kept overnight for observation as it had been diagnosed that the poor animal had been poisoned. The way his tired eyes would dart back and forth as if asking if he was gonna be ok made me bite the inside of my cheeks just to keep my emotions at bay.

A con about this profession that we rarely speak out is how happiness could turn into horror in just a snap. Sometimes you couldn't help but bargain with God just for another chance for an animal's life and often times it goes unanswered.  

It felt like a stick was stuck in my throat as my hand picked up the phone with a task to deliver the message to the family. I don't think there will ever be enough general anesthesia to numb you in moments like this.

After three rings the call finally got answered by the older brother. I asked for their mom or dad but unfortunatelty one was at work while the other was busy sleeping away her hang-over. 

Before I could ask for another adult to speak to the boy, with a resigned voice, said 

""He's gone isn't he?"" 

Silence filled the line as I never thought that my heart could break anymore. The boy then continued with a word, in a totally different tone of voice, that broke my soul

""Good"""

Like any creature, it carries microbial life on the outside and inside. We are one tiny species that lives on the skin of the world, thinking ourselves to be alone in our superiority. We are not. Shamballa, Shangri la, Agartha, there are many cities and civilisations writing their own histories in the bowels of our shared planet. Different species flourish inside from divergent evolutionary lines, dinosaurs in bipedal forms, insectoid ant creatures wise with hive intelligence and yes, even humans from long gone ancient civilizations who survived cataclysms by escaping into the deep.

The secret government organizations know about this. Worldwide, there are hundreds of task forces working on monitoring, studying and even communicating with certain members of the inner Earth. All the human atrocities of the last five thousand years are games played by the families of ancestors who had once long ago, stumbled upon the secrets of the inner Earth and become very powerful. The truth is that a battle between forces of benevolence and malevolence had been long fought over the millennia and this select group of humans on the surface had in ages past allied themselves with the powers inside our planet. They gained secrets to rule over others, betrayed their own kind and even sent sacrifices to their masters. We do not know much about the secret wars they have fought but those bloodlines persist today. Their plans to dominate the surface have bloomed into fruition in the latter part of the 20th century. Division, chaos, pitting us against each other. The goal was to spread evil. All seemed in their grasp.

However, it turns out we humans may be more divine than we think. As I write this now, we are balancing on the razor's edge in a fight against an authoritarian new world order. As we push back a Reich of evil that looks once again to be thwarted, good always comes to light. We will win this fight and we will learn the truth. And then... We will have to face the true monsters inside the Earth."

His breath hitched, eyes wide as saucers, then he laughed. “Come on, babe we agreed to work things out,” the smile died when he looked me in the eyes, “It was just a silly mistake.”

“Multiple mistakes if you could even call it that at this point.”

He paced back and forth in the living room.

“Okay, who put you up to this? Was it Samantha? Or maybe it was Jasmine, the silly bitch always loved putting her nose where it doesn’t belong.”

“It has nothing to do with either of them.” I sighed,  “This is all me.”

“No it’s not, Vanessa. You’re crazy about me,” his vile hand caressed my cheek, “like I am about you.”

“So crazy that you cheated five times, hell there’s probably more incidents.”

As if the words had cut him, he flinched. “Babe, I swear on my life that’s not the case.”

“Unfortunately for you, the words of a compulsive liar mean as much as a pile of dog shit on a summer day. I’ll be out of your hair by the end of the week.”

Luke tried everything in his power to assuage my apparent anger: romantic candle lit dinners, put on her favorite movies, he got a tattoo of my name on his chest, and on Wednesday he brought out a framed picture of the first date after becoming official. He was stupefied when I smashed the frame and set the photo ablaze

The memory of Vanessa and Luke’s smile turned into smoldering ashes before his eyes. He faked closure with the situation, asking me to one last dinner on Thursday, an amicable parting between two souls that were never meant for each other in the first place. I acquiesced and found myself drugged. When I came to I was chained to the wall in the basement.

It wasn’t long after I woke that he came downstairs.

“Wow, Luke. Reaching new heights of stupidity here.”

His appearance was disheveled, messy hair and rings of sleep deprivation under his eyes.

“I-I just need a little bit more time to convince you is all.”

“You’d put your life on the line for a woman you constantly betrayed. It's completely irrational.” I laughed.

“Why are you talking like that it’s almost as if…”

As it dawned on him, I ripped the cuff from the wall and just as quick as it was for him to blink I was upon him, clutching him by his neck.

“Well that took a while. I thought you’d figure it out sooner. She was tired of the disrespect, of being captive to your charms so she sought measures to free herself. And much to my chagrin, I have no need for an unfaithful mutt.”

I slammed his head into the wall with enough force to knock him unconscious. I wouldn’t be sullying my hands with the blood of someone so pathetic.  Besides with my new body, it was best not to complicate things."

For centuries trapped dormant in ice


Something extremely naughty and not very nice


Lost to the world and extremely contagious


Takes over its victims and makes them rampageous



Almost forgotten but now starting to thaw


Pops out the snow to start spreading its spores


Now unfrozen this hell spawn won't stop


When finally the spores find a little workshop 



Little cute elves tinker away


Going about their busy elf day


Getting so close, only a few days left


When through an open window the spores start to drift



Sucked in through their mouths or up their nose


The spores root in fast and just start to grow


Their joyful sing songs turn into growls


Their new insatiable hunger brings on the prowl



Santas now hauled up, with Mrs Claus 


They've blocked up the windows and nailed shut the doors


Tinsel and ribbons, presents forgotten 


The elves have been eating, their bodies now rotten



Mrs Claus has be bitten ""Are you still with me?""


Then Santa continues ""We'll escape up the chimney!""


Mrs Claus tries to move and let's out a yelp


""Don't worry my darling, I'll go for help""



He squirms through the hearth, but just his luck


He climbs up the chimney but then he gets stuck


And in all the panic he starts to shout


""I'm claustrophobic, I need to get out!""



Then he can hear it, the trip trap on the roof


His reindeers are coming and this is the proof


And as he looks up to see his brave saviors


When he sees poor old Rudolph, showing frantic behaviors



The glow of his nose lights up the din


He breaks off his antlers as he pulls himself in


His hoofs chip as they scrape on the bricks


Santa closes his eyes, he knows this is it …



Children will wake and will all start to cry


No presents and parents will all wonder why


And as the families all start to panic


A little old spore floats across the atlantic"

I wanted to talk to Amy about it so I went down into the basement to see her but she must have been sleeping. Her eyes and mouth were open but not all the way. The top of her head was off too and I looked inside but I didn’t see her brain. That’s funny. I thought Amy was supposed to be really smart! She went to University, isn’t that where smart people go?

“Conquering,” he says. “Remember that word. We must Conquer ourselves, strip away selfish desires, and become True Team Players. Your identity can’t just co-exist with that of the company, it has to *be* the company.”

A flurry of buzzwords and catchphrases squirm in your ears - their meaning by now so diluted that they carry no real intent, no real form. Like snow melting before hitting the ground - inconsequential. 

Yet, you are left feeling like you’re too stupid to understand.  And that’s his secret, you figure. That’s how he Conquers.

They stuffed you in a cold and drafty half-office, with exposed vents, and wires hanging haphazardly from the ceiling - yet they wanted you to feel happy about it.

“No more distractions,” he said.

Every day he’ll come to belittle you. Once in a while, he’ll even do it in front of others. Use you as an example. As a lesson to be learnt. He’ll always end the public humiliation by assuring you that he’s your *biggest fan* though. 

All *no hard feelings*\-like.

Sometimes you stare into the darkness of the vents, imagining quite vividly all the things you’d like to do to him. Carve open his face with a box-cutter. Pop open his eyes with your teeth. Slice off that smug grin, and mount it on your wall like a trophy.

One day it is different though. One day the vents stare back at you; a pair of eerily shimmering emerald eyes barely visible there in the depths.

“I can help you,” a soft voice whispers into your ear. “I can make him pay.”

You don’t question the validity of this claim. You don’t feel afraid. It’s like a part of you always knew he was in there, hiding, waiting for the moment you were ready.

“How?” you ask.

“Not how it works,” the voice hisses. “Yes or No. Accept or Decline.”

You know there’ll be a price. A terrible one. One you’ll have to live with for the rest of your life.

You nod. “Yes,” you say. 

“Splendid,” the voice utters.

Months go by, and you feel better. It took some getting used to admittedly, but it’s not so bad. Every morning you wake up, go to the bathroom, undress, and stare at yourself in the mirror.

Then you spend the next hour or so carving his face open with a box-cutter, popping his eyes with your teeth, and mounting yet another pair of lips on your wall.

And when you wake up tomorrow, he’ll sprout right back again.

And you can Conquer him all over."

I remember going to visit my grandma when I was a little boy. She lived in a plain wooden house painted a peculiar tan color, and it sat on the outskirts of town, a town not unlike any number of small, dusty towns in southeast Texas amid oil fields and rice growers in the latter part of the twentieth century.

My grandma’s house edged up to a large rice field, and across the field and behind a row of trees there was a railroad track. My brother and I used to sleep on the hide-a-bed sofa in the living room, and we’d both lie awake well past bedtime listening to the noises from the field and distant woods until sometime around midnight, when a train would make its way toward us from some far away place on the other side of the world. We’d hear it, the low rumbling in the distance, growing inexorably stronger and only disturbed by the occasional blast from the train’s horn, louder and louder, inspiring fear-laden excitement in us both as it drew closer, finally reaching the point where the power of the train would rattle the window panes gently in their frames until the engine had passed by the field, continuing on to wherever it was headed. Then the rumble, low and insistent, like a herd of buffalo stampeding past mixed with the rhythmic *clack clack* of train cars passing over imperfections in the rails.

There’s something about a mind that romanticizes our memories if we let it, softens the edges and sprinkles a little magic across the top. That’s how I remember the trains at grandma’s. The memories excite me, even as they fill my heart with hesitancy and a sense of unavoidable caution, a sense of knowing the boogieman is out there but you’re going in anyway. Then life happens; you grow older and find reality, and you find failure and heartache, and you find that people will let you down. You find that you’ll let yourself down, and life loses its magic.

I’ve been thinking about grandma’s trains as I walk along these rails in the middle of nowhere in the darkest part of night, remembering how we’d stay awake until we’d hear the train coming, remembering the excitement and the fear, not unlike how I felt this very instant as I heard the train coming toward me from some faraway land. There’s the low rumble, growing ever more present, then you can feel the rumble coming through your shoes, through your feet until you feel it in all your bones. Then there’s the light, round and distant but drawing nearer, the vibrations growing stronger. There’s fear and excitement, both exacerbated by the blast of the train’s horn, and the light growing larger and brighter, washing over you in waves until there’s nothing but you and the light and the roar of the train, *faster* *and* *faster* until the light overtakes and absorbs you and all your regret into the night."

Behind them the city, before them the mist rising from the grey-black waters like minarets collapsing in the dawn. 

A zipper whined, and Trenton stuck his head out and blinked against the cold. The other tents were still. The ones who knew him as Hook Hand or One Eye still huddled in what passed for warmth without a home. 

Good, he thought, limping towards a shopping cart and pushing it onward. 

A hour grated into the groaning of garbage trucks, and Trenton raced ahead of them to ply discarded bags for bottles, cans, food, and the rare article of clothing. 

After, he sat beside his wares and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich still fresh from its plastic, and then found a spot behind the amphitheater to do his business. 

He pushed his cart back towards the river, and found the first body. 

It lay crumpled and wet beyond the railing, a pale shape layered in seaweed. 

Trenton froze. Wind spoke. He looked north and south and saw no one. Shapes out of the past bled from memory, dead men lying a war-torn desert landscape. The corpse before him was no different, empty, broken, bereft of all that had made it a man. 

Trenton pushed his cart on with a rattle, hurrying towards the avenue beyond the river. 

Yards on, he stumbled upon the next body. 

It hung the railing like demented crepe. 

Moans escaped Trenton's lips, and he broke into a run, footfalls conjoined with the metallic groan of the wheels. 

All sound conjoined into an explosion of metal, screams, and thudding flesh as the cart rammed into a shape on the ground, sending Trenton cartwheeling. 

He gasped and pushed himself up. 

Bodies. A string of the dead snaking ahead, bending with the river. 

Among them tattered pieces of tents. 

And in the distance, a figure shrouded in mist, slurping on a writhing form, discarding it, and then casting its many eyes on Trenton, who smelled blood and the deep awful brine of an impossible sea."

Brian was always angry. Never physical- he was too smart for that and had too much to lose. And he lacked any modicum of talent and charisma to channel the rage into a gig as a stand-up comedian or TV personality. But he emitted a constant stream of low-level rage- at everyone. All the time.

Right now it was the mother of the kid who was at his place, on a playdate with his kid. She was late. It was supper time. Brian's wife tried to mollify him. “It’s no problem, we can have supper now, Henry’s friend can eat with us.”

“And have her interrupt our supper? And that brat is probably allergic to something- he looks like one of those types who’s allergic to water. And have them sue us?”

The bell rang- Brian was spoiling for a fight. “I’ll get it!” 

The mother looked stressed but smiled at Brian “I’m so sorry I’m late- traffic, you know.”

Brian smiled back “And I suppose you didn’t realise it would be rush hour now? We’ve been waiting.”

The woman’s smile faded. “Well, I’m here now! Would you mind getting him?”

But Brian wasn’t done “How would you feel if your students arrived late in class? Just smile?” For she was a professor at a local college, and that bothered him. 

The woman laughed “I didn’t realise this playdate was a classroom! And you must be wanting supper. Can you call him please? Or I could go in get him?”

Brian didn’t reply, but blocked the doorway with his arm. The woman craned her neck and called out her son’s name. 

There was no response. 

The woman looked straight at Brian. She said softly “Get my son. Now.”

Brian kept smiling, “I just want to see how you like waiting, it’s only fair”. 

The woman reached out and lightly put her hand on Brian’s chest. “Hey!” cried Brian “Take your hand off...”

He didn’t finish. She made a sharp twisting motion with her hand, and pulled it away from his chest. Something black erupted from him. Brian screamed. 

His wife and the two kids ran to the hallway. They saw the woman on the doorstep pull out something like a rope of smoky blackness from his chest, twisting it around her wrist, Brian staggering back and howling with pain. The woman kept pulling and twisting the blackness around her wrist and arm. 

Eventually she stopped. Brain fell backward, his eyes shut, sweat covering his face. But his chest looked unharmed. 

The woman shook the blackness off her arm, where it dissolved and vanished into the air. 

She held out her hand to her son, “Come along love, we’ve got things to do”. She smiled at Brian’s wife “Don’t worry, he’s fine. I think you’ll find him much better when wakes up.” 

She turned and left with her son. Brian’s wife and son stood in shock for a moment. Then they too turned, and went inside to have supper."

The iconic tv channel nearly everyone watches, we usually watch it for the news or mainly the tv shows, but something strange has been recently happening to me. 

It’s been going off air at the most weirdest times, specifically when it’s the news or a weather forecast, it says “BBC one HD cannot show this programme from your area, we will resume programming in 6 minutes” Why 6 minutes?  Why do you need to go off air?

Why at this specific moment? That’s what I was wondering until about  A month ago, and trust me. I was horrified what I heard. That’s when I found out.

Sometimes, you can see the reporter looking behind the camera (only for a split second) and having a fearful expression, sometimes you can also hear someone whisper (faintly)from behind the camera, “we’re not done yet, keep talking!” If you’re not careful enough you won’t hear it, it’s very hard to catch the moment when they whisper but keep a good ear and eye. I sometimes catch these red flags.



And that’s when it goes off air. 
Saying the same thing, I feel something Is off every time it goes off air, like they’re covering something sinister,up. 
It got weirder as it went on, a few weeks later, it got horrifying,  It got to the moment with the weather forecast and it went off air, as per usual. I shat my pants as I suddenly heard the news reporter crying, screaming and begging for his life,
“Please, don’t kill me, I have kids and a wife!” “I’ll give you my money!” Anything! Just please don’t kill me!” the cameraman yells “SHUT UP! YOU’RE NOT WORTH MY TIME!” And stabs the news reporter in the neck (based on what I heard), I heard a knife going through flesh, coughing and gurgling, it then went silent as a body thudded into the floor. 

That was a month ago and I get anxious every time it happens, I’m expecting to hear screams or something similar. But that doesn’t happen anymore. (Hopefully)"

Hazel eyes took note of the time that said 2:45 am as a red Honda pulled up the building, dust scattering as its tires kissed the pavement. 

A blonde girl doned a tight top tank while doc martens laced her feet, an image like every boy's dream. Her steps held a pep in them that her overall aura radiated friendliness.

The polite smile blinded Matthew as she approached the counter and asked for gas. Small talk was made that made the boy think that maybe nightshifts weren't so bad before calling the attention of his co-worker who was on the drinks section and told him to man the front as he had a tank to fill. 

It didn't take long for the job to be done but it felt like forever for Matthew as his sight was greeted by a man clothed in all black laying on the floor of the backseat. A quick glimmer on the person's hand told the boy that the stranger was carrying a knife. 

Determination with each stride, Matthew went back in the store and informed the girl of what he saw. The girl wore a blank face at first that slowly turned into softness as she reassuringly said 

""Don't worry, he's not the real monster."" 

The reply left Matthew speechless and frozen in his spot as the girl patted his shoulders and exited the building after paying for her purchase. 

Tunes of the 60's filled the airwaves as the girl drove away. The innocence of her hums countered the sinister act the man in the back was about to commit.

He slowly sat up and raised his knife but his action was halted that caused him to drop his weapon as he felt cold and sharp elongated fingers close around his neck. A scream died in his throat as the creature pulled him between the seats and into the trunk, breaking his body in the process. 

The sound in the trunk, both animalistic and inhumane, sang throughout the early morning as the vehicle entered another state.

A smile formed on her lips as she glanced in the rearview mirror and said ""Eat well."""

The hallway is only five feet long, but it takes ten timid steps to travel the distance that seems to stretch on longer and longer as the tapping—the *tick*—gets louder. Tick-tap. Tap-tap. *Tick*. The open doorway at the end yawns widely, growing seemingly larger and larger until it swallows the hallway and you are surrounded by a furious flurry of that horrible, hollow sound—tick-tick-tick-*tap*. 

There is sharp and sudden quiet when the threshold of the doorway is crossed. You look into the room which gets less dark with each passing minute that you stare. Details emerge. Something moves like a shadow across oil. *Taptaptaptap*. You take a subtle step backward after a long, careful pause.

Ideally that would be an incredible thing, a brilliant kind of gift. And that was the same thought the young boy had when he made the deal. 

What he didn’t know was that the dealmaker was a trickster, an evil creature who had no sympathy for us.

And so he did grant the boy his wish, but with a twist. Every human would now be free to pursue their desire, but it would be for eternity.

Even when a person died they would remain on this earth, ever driven to meet their goals. And the deal did not only apply to all current humans, it applied to every human past present and future. Anyone who had ever lived was revived.

At first, some people celebrated, others roared in outrage. But soon problems became realized.

Those who were revived didn’t stop rotting, didn’t stop feeling pain, didn’t stop needing to eat. And yet they couldn’t die, they could never die.

If they wound up near dead or destroyed soon they would soon regenerate and be returned. And yet the rot never stopped, the pain of hunger never faltered.

The sickly smell of decay spread across continents. Every landmass on earth was covered with the returned.

A putrid and disgusting smell of spoiling meat existed all across the world.

The returned existed in a constant state of torment, fully conscious, ever in pain, and unable to die.

Our cities became like great mausoleums, where the living and the dead walked alongside each other.

Things continued like this for a time, with the returned just being a fact of life, but eventually it was too much to bear.

Some returned were driven mad by their own existence. They turned on the living, desperate to eat.

And so governments rounded them up and buried them alive in great crypts. Others were chained and thrown in oceans.

Millions of prisoners were pardoned as the jails were repurposed to hold the dead.

The rich who still lived bought the right to remain in society once they died. The poor would be locked away once their time came.

And so that is the world. Many of the returned still exist in regular life, others are buried deep below or hidden away.

In the hills and in the forests many of the maddened dead still roam. Hiding and preying on unsuspecting victims.

Tearing away all flesh, and leaving nothing but bones behind. Forever driven by their hunger.

Jobs exist around hunting and rounding up the returned. Other jobs exist to find ways of decreasing the pain of those returned who can afford to stay.

They are simply a part of life now.

Some would call this earth a form of hell, but it’s really not so different from the one that came before it.

Surely all this isn't what the boy wished for?"

He had heard the promise of safety, of hard work rewarded with good money—money he couldn’t make back at home. He would spend some, only what he needed. He’d send most back at Western Union. It would buy bottled water, food, a roof, clothes and aspirin. It wouldn’t make his family rich, but it would give them a chance. He’d struggle, but it would be worth it.

Tomorrow he would run. He’d jump the electric fence somehow. He’d limp through a bullet in his thigh if he had to. He wouldn’t be sold to another farmer in Indiana or Kentucky.

We promise a superb standard of service, and food that is drop-dead delicious! Figuratively or literally, depending on your luck.

Don’t mind the people you see dying agonisingly - they’re the unfortunate ones. I should remind you that you chose to come, and compensation cannot be provided if you…y’know, die. It’s called Russian Roulette Restaurant for a reason. If you wish, I could upgrade you to a private booth, so you can ignore the incessant death tolls of the damned.

For our appetizer, we have burrata served with tomatoes, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. As many culinary masters say, plating is what makes or breaks the dish. You’ll be served with either steel or pewter plates, both equally shiny and squeaky clean. However, the acidic tomatoes and vinegar leech the lead out of the pewter plates, which will lead to your untimely death! Geddit? Lead leads you to your…nevermind.

Next up, we have bangers and mash. I should clarify that bangers are sausages and mash is mashed potatoes - we had people who misunderstood before. The mash is the interesting part: maybe it’s plain ol’ potatoes, or maybe it’s sprouted potatoes which we left in the garden for a month with onions on the side. The sprouts will give you something between an upset stomach and death. 

Finally, we have tapioca pudding for dessert, featuring our handmade tapioca pearls. Whether we have bothered to remove the skin and cook it properly or not will decide whether you walk out unscathed or collapse from cyanide poisoning. 

We are a pet-friendly establishment, and even encourage people to bring their beloved furry brethren. Our treats are filling, nutritious and may contain dark chocolate - we all know what that does to our precious puppers.

You may come out of this restaurant fulfilled and filled, with a churning stomach, or in a box. It all depends on fate’s hand - whether she spares your soul or decides to drop you into a den of devils. But isn’t all of our lives a mere roll of the die? We cannot choose to be crushed by a car, or lose our legs to a landmine, or be impaled by an icicle.

So, my dear guests - bon appetit."

My heart went out for it. It was abandoned, cold, and very hungry. No one else seemed to have noticed the bundle of black cloth. They all scurried by, muttering to themselves about their day.

So I took it home. I fed it milk from a baby bottle. Then I named it Momo.

A few days later, Momo seemed to be strong enough to move around. It finally wriggled out of its blankets and yawned, revealing white fangs.

At first glance it appeared to look like a small black dragon. It was covered in charcoal-black scales, had leathery wings, and small white claws. It also had a pair of small black horns, standing straight upon its head like little hills.

And its eyes. The cutest green eyes I had ever seen.

But eventually the worst thing happened. I ran out of food.

I tried splitting my portion and giving half to Momo, but it refused, turning its snout up at me. Nothing I had would satisfy it. Vegetables, rice, dog kibble. If I tried to feed it, it would spit it out right away.

I was growing desperate. Momo was growing more aggressive. It paced around the house, growling, pouncing on rats and vermin and swallowing it whole.

Eventually, I tentatively offered my arm to Momo. “For you,” I whispered, tears in my eyes.

Momo seized the chance. It lunged, its fangs sinking into the flesh. It tore off my arm like bread and it disappeared down its throat.

Pain shot up my spine. *It is all worth it*  I thought, squeezing my eyes shut.

Momo licked its fangs. Its claws reached for my throat.

“Anything for you, buddy,” I sighed, watching life bleed out of me.

“Anything.”"

I like to watch the snowfall and laugh at the silly little flowers complaining about the cold. Wimpy little flowers. The humans on my property clearly like it too. They decorate their big box-house and sing funny songs about mythical figures who can only be some kind of deities. They call this time of year 'Christmastime' because they have a holiday called Christmas, which is like solstice but with more sugar rushes and 'capitalism', whatever that is.

The humans are so nice to me. They call me their 'little outdoor Christmas tree.' As far as I can tell, an outdoor is someone who isn't in a building. I know that because the little sapling humans say they like being outdoors. Anyway, I like being a Christmas tree because I get to wear lights. I look so pretty with all the colorful glowy bits, even more so than in the spring when blown-away flower petals get stuck in my twigs. The wiry bits are a little annoying and scratchy, but it's more than worth it.

This year the humans were at it again with the Christmas thing, and I got to wear my lights again. But the little ones were complaining about how they wanted a 'real Christmas tree'. Last I checked I'm plenty real, but they persisted until the adult ones said ""Okay"". The next day they must have done something while I was asleep because when I woke up, I looked in the house window and there was another tree inside. I was perplexed because how does one just spring up inside a house overnight?

Then I realized that this was what the small humans meant when they said they wanted a new tree. Honestly, I was at first pretty jealous that I wasn't 'real' enough for Christmas. But I realized that this tree just got lucky and I should be happy for them. They don't seem to be very happy with themself though, always talking at me through the window as if there's a danger. Lookin' really scared of no-one-knows-what.

Silly, it's obvious that being inside a house is very safe, why else would the humans hideaway there all night? I have to admit they look quite nice, (albeit like they could use some water) all decorated even more than I am. So ungrateful, that in-door tree, getting to wear lights like mine and not even being happy about it."

To my knowledge, he has never ever broken one. This was initially one of the things that made me fall in love with him. 

One day when we were lounging on the couch, I was reading a book and he was scrolling on his phone, he noticed some scars on my arm. I usually wore long sleeves or shirts that covered my arms but it was especially hot out so I decided to put on a tank top, forgetting about my scars that had faded quite a bit. 

He was very angry. 

“Anna, who did this to you? I promise I’ll kill them” he seethed, his face red and his eyes bulging. 

I looked over at him and quietly told him that a few years ago I was going through a lot and self harmed because I was in a very dark place. I assured him I didn’t feel like this anymore, I worked hard and I’m doing much better.

He nodded and got up. I went back to reading my book. 

A few minutes later, he came out of the kitchen with a large knife. I looked at him, eyes wide. He started to walk towards me, with dead eyes. 

“Wh- what are you doing?” I stuttered 

He looked at me grimly and thrust the knife into my chest. 

“I always keep my promises”"

When I found it, I was desolate. My wife, Jenny, had left me for a 'younger model,' as she deemed it. I took to the forest to stop anyone seeing my tears or hearing my wails of anguish. I thought that the forest would clear my mind. Allow me to write a letter back to her, as she had written to me. I read her damn letter four or five times during my wandering. 

""Fuck her! Fuck her for doing this to me."" 

As my rant echoed out through the trees I spotted the red post box. It was clean, free from vines or moss. It stood proud amidst the trees like a beacon of some weird hope. 

I thought, I'd write her a fucking letter. I'll make her understand how she's made me feel and how the next letter she'd receive would be one for divorce. With my back pressed against the cold red box, I began to write. At the end, my conviction began to waver. I didn't want a divorce. I wanted her dead. 

I couldn't give her the letter I wrote. The things on there were ugly. Brutal. Instead, I folded the letter up and posted it through the box. A second later and a different letter popped out. 

Confused, I ripped it open and studied the content. There was a brief message. 

**Welcome to the wish box, your deposit has been received. Delivery expected in three days.**

I had been pranked. I knew it. Why else would a post box be all the way out here? Feeling even shittier, I ventured back through the forest and to my empty home. 

The next few days were uneventful. Jenny never came back. Her clothes were gone. The memories of our time were left to mock me. But on the third day, a knock sounded on my door. 

I ventured off the couch, sluggishly, and opened the door. There on the mat was a little black box tied with a ruby bow. Bewildered, I took it inside and placed it on the table. I didn't know who could be sending me a gift. Maybe it was Jenny, mockingly giving me back her key. Fuck her. I left it where it was and went off to work. 

The next morning another parcel arrived. This one was slightly bigger, longer in length, black like the first and tied with another ruby bow. 

Tired of her jokes, I decided to open the first box. I dropped it in shock. Out popped a severed finger. I knew it was Jenny's the moment I saw it. Because it had the wedding ring I gave her. Inside was a note. 

**Thanks for choosing the wishing box.**"

I didn’t hear her as much as I sensed her, like a prickle on the back of my neck. She was only a few paces away from where I stood.

She was small, and despite the cold, she stood in the snow in only a long nightgown, bare-footed. There was a strange look on her face, something hard to place. Despite my heavy fur coat, I felt a chill up and down my back.

“Child,” I said, my voice cracking a little, “don’t you know there is a monster in these woods?” No one had ever managed to sneak up on me before. I felt my heart racing in my chest. 

Her dark eyes looked at me, *through me*. Her face was gaunt, her waist-length hair tangled and wild. 

When she finally spoke, her voice sounded like a whisper through the trees- faint, breathless.

“Mister. Please.” 

I swallowed hard. “Child. These woods are no place for a little girl. You must return home- there is a monster in these woods.” 

We stared at each other for a long moment. Then- she reached out to me, the sleeves on her arms falling back to reveal the bruises and burns and whip lashes, old and new.

“Yes, mister. I know. He’s my papa. Please-“ and then she began to fall forward, trembling like a leaf, her fear and hopelessness finally catching up to her.

Only she didn’t fall, because then I *did* drop my axe, covered the distance between us, and caught her. I kneeled down, and her tiny hands gripped my furry arms with an enormous strength. She tried to speak again but I shushed her comfortingly, lifting her up like she weighed nothing at all.

“Yes. I understand now. The monster in the woods will not hurt you ever again. *No one* will ever hurt you again, I promise*.

She snuggled into my chest, deep into my fur, the last of her remaining energy spent. I wiped a snowflake off of her bruised cheek with my claw as it began to snow. I knew that by the time anyone knew she was gone, my hoofed tracks would be buried once again, leaving no trace for the monster to follow."

*“A spooky new survey of more than 2000 pet owners reveals that more than 30% believe their* **pets** *protect them from* **evil spirits***…”*

Madysyn looked over her laptop at Fox, who was staring unblinkingly at the empty space under the door frame, the bright reddish-orange fur on the back of her neck rippling. The door itself slightly swayed back and forth. It was always the same spot. Madysyn felt uneasy and jumped up. 

“Fox! Treaties!” She shook a bag of cat treats and instantly Fox bounded over, purring excitedly. She had always been such greedy little kittie, she would sell the humans for a handful of treats, they joked. 

“Hey! Careful, you almost had my finger there!” cried Madysyn as she scattered the treats around for her. Another family joke. 

This behaviour was new. Madysyn tried to remember if Fox had stared and growled at doors before they moved here, but she really couldn’t. Fox was generally a lazy, chill older cat, fond of sunning herself, accepting their pettings and caresses with casual disdain, but then demanding attention by jumping on their laptops while they were working. All pretty typical cat stuff. 

She heard Tommie crying through the baby monitor, and jumped to get him. She happened to glance back as she left the living room, and saw Fox had returned to the same spot by the door frame, staring at the empty space. 

She growled softly. 

The air seemed to move and flicker. 

Tommie’s cries rose to a piercing shriek but Madysyn couldn’t move. 

There was something- a shape, a thickening of space around Fox.  

For one split second, Fox seemed to lift, snap and twist out of shape, her paws stretched out, her lips drawn back in a terrible snarl, a short sharp howl rising over Tommie’s shrieks. 

Then everything snapped back into space. Fox was calmly padding to the couch, nestling into her favourite napping spot. Madysyn shook her head and rushed to get Tommie. As he calmed down, she carried him back to the living room with him. 

Fox was standing in the middle of the room, staring straight at them. Tommie erupted into wild screams louder than anything Madysyn had ever heard. She cuddled the frightened baby close to her, trying to protect it from the thickening darkness that was surrounding them. 

As Madysyn and Tommie were lifted and carried away, she managed one last glance at her old living room. 

A woman who looked like her was bending down, her hand outstretched towards Fox. Fox was sniffing excitedly at the treats she was holding out. Next to Fox, a happy baby dressed in Tommie’s clothes was crawling. Madysyn wailed with agony as the realization hit her. 

Fox had indeed sold her and Tommie for a handful of cat treats. 

Her last view of her home was the replacement baby lifting its head, looking straight at her with bright yellow eyes, and grinning. 

Then the darkness descended fully on them."

Why do that gotta sneeze so fucking loud with every fucking dogdamn sneeze!? Huh? Why am I, seeming for no real reason besides “Fuck you, that’s why”, the only dad in the neighborhood who can’t sneeze like a firecracker in a tuba?

Oh sure, yeah. They strut around the sidewalks, look at those fucks, their big fucking schnozes like amplifiers for their sneezes. Oh, I’m sure they’re huffing all the pollen right out of the air and thundering out concussive sneezes that rattle my windows on purpose just to rub it in my face. Fuck them. Fuck my tiny nose.

I can’t sneeze like that, okay? I'm nose challenged. Small-nosed. I can hardly wear glasses. I try every fucking day to have genuinely booming sneeze that would wake a hibernating bear, snap that slumbering bastard right out of a beautiful dream full of bouncing bear babe boobies. That’s what the other dads can do. I hear bears roar in annoyed rage from the hills every time one of these dads loads up his shotgun schnoz and blasts another sneeze into the atmosphere. Fuck their shotgun achoo's.

They think they’re so cool with the way they can strip bark off a birch hands free with a well-angled sneeze. Their sneezes are like hewing axes, cleaving both the trees and the ears of any passersby. But, were they to make their nasal borne dire wolf’s snarl, in the presence of another prodigiously proboscis’d dad, then that passing dad would bark back. A call to brothers in noses. A fraternity of horn blowers that outshine an orchestra. I can’t be a part of your stupid sneeze club? Little ol’ puny nose can’t output enough achooey to be in the big daddies club?

My nose is small, any moron can tell that much just from a glance. It’s a single raisin on an oatmeal face while the rest of the dads out there are pushing plums, no, bigger, they’re got eggplants in their oatmeal. Gah, that doesn’t even make any sense! I can’t think straight with his mininose of mine! Fuckers out there are vacuuming up all the pollen and dust right out of the neighborhood air, sniffing all the AC out of my dogdamn house! I can hardly get a sneeze off! And when I do, it’s just a little toot. A petite squeak. A mouse orgasm. I couldn’t startle a virgin daisy with my sneezes. Fuckers!

Not no more! I hosted a BBQ, see? A tasty BBQ hoedown that no dad can turn down, and sauced them slabs of meat with sleepy sauce, yeah. It didn't take long, no, not at all. Those big noses ain't so tough to slice off. Yeah and now I'm the one with the big fucking nose. Each one fits so snuggly around my stubby schnoz, like I was always meant to be the loudest sneezing dad of all! Impressed, kids? Impressed by your dad's thunderous, walloping sneezes now!?

And he had:

straight through the still-steaming wound in mother's chest; audibly, so that bits of broken ribs crackled under the sole of his black boot.

""I am not raising your mother again,"" he said.

My little brother screamed.

""And you,"" father said, ignoring him, turning his attention to me, ""are not to do it for him. No matter how unbearable and loud he gets. Is that understood?""

""Yes, father,"" I said.

""Good.""

He removed his boot from mother's innards, and wiped the blood and bile from it using a towel.

My little brother started crying, but before I—

""He'll never learn *if every time someone does it for him*.""

I remembered last week:

*The accidentally-summoned demon, the maternal decapitation, the high-pitched, neverending shriek I couldn't stand; couldn't stand so much that I returned the demon to Hell, stitched mother's head back on, albeit not very well, simple straight-stitch only, but thank Satan the old Singer still has enough power to pierce human skin, before reciting a few words of basic necromancy.*

""You're not a child anymore,"" father said. ""If you want your mother back, you'll have to raise her yourself.""

""Actions,"" he lectured, ""have consequences.""

My brother pouted. ""I want a hellhound *and* a mother."" His pouting transmogrified into stomping. ""Hellhound and mother. **Hell-hound-and…**""

Then there were two of them.

Both stomping and both chanting—until father snapped the Illusion out of existence, then whispered the original's lips away. ""Don't be a brat or I'll erase your entire face.""

My brother stiffened.

""If you can call a hellhound and mirror yourself, surely you can raise the dead,"" I suggested.

He regained his lips just in time to stick out his tongue, which, I must admit, took all my willpower not to set on hellfire.

""At your age,"" father said, ""I was cursing bankers and manipulating elections. You're still playing with voodoo dolls.""

""Voodoo *action figures*,"" my brother said sullenly.

Father closed his eyes momentarily.

""You didn't…""

""I did,"" he said, opening them. ""You'll get your toys back when your mother is undead again.""

Just then, I noticed a touch of motion—slight, weak—the gentle curling and uncurling of a bony finger. ""Look,"" I said, ""she's still alive.""

They both looked.

On the ground, mother groaned, as her eyes filled now with horrible incomprehension. Although I didn't say so out loud, I was proud of myself, for I must have done an excellent job on that
neck stitch.

A triumphant expression spread itself across my brother's face.

—cut short:

""Oh, no. Don't you dare think this changes anything,"" father said.

""I can't *raise* the living,"" my brother retorted.

""On that we agree.""

My brother stood, staring: at mother, gurgling on the floor; at father, staring confidently back. ""Well, go on,"" father said. ""*Kill your mother*. Surely even you can handle that much."""

I am a witch and I tell people everyday that I am a witch but they all keep accusing of not being a witch. It makes me mad and I tell them how I turn people into nipples, and also how they should be worried if thier nipples are even thier own. I also told them how I bewitched people into seeing things and make them dance to no music, and yet these bastards accuse of me of not being a witch. I take part in the rituals and I sing songs of evil but they still accuse me of not being a witch. 

I then decided to prove these idiots wrong and that I am a witch, when they burned another witch and I was so jealous as that other witch got the recognition that she was a witch. These people still think that I am not a witch and that's why they will not burn me. So with the head of a man I had chopped off in some other persons garden, I started floating in the air with this chopped off head. People were accusing me of not being a witch and they didn't even burn me at the stake, but some other witch who is a fake got burned at the stake. 

I keep telling them how I can talk to cats and I even managed to turn a cat into a shape of a human being in front of a crowd, and they shouted and mocked me of not being a witch. I fought back and shouted back ""I am a witch!"" And I turned some people in the crowd into frogs, goats and other animals. Even as animals they still accused me of not being a witch even though I have been practicing it for years. I have terrorised people with my magic and I have ruined villages and yet no one is willing to give me the recognition that I deserve and burn me as a witch. 

They keep singing songs of my name involved of how I am not a witch. They accuse me of not being a witch, which is the most horrible of accusations. Then one morning I woke up to find the whole area in front of my house and they are now recognising me as a witch. They are carrying me to burn me at the stake and it is the proudest moment of my life. Finally everyone knows and sees me as a witch. I forgave those who had accused me of not being a witch before by turning them back into normal people, when I had turned them into nipples and animals. 

As I started to burn I was delighted to finally be recognised as a witch and I shouted out to the crowd ""none of you have to worry about your nipples not being yours anymore!"""

I was so excited when my wife learned she was pregnant with our first child. We were both so happy. Everything was okay during the first eight and a half months, before she went into labor early. I was so worried for her and our baby, considering she was having very painful contractions. 

The delivery was longer than it should have been. She kept struggling as her contractions came in shorter period of time and sharper. The doctor told me she would have to have a c-section to prevent complications. She was immediately prepped for surgery, as was I.

Though she was given pain medication, she still complained of sharp contractions. She kept telling me that something was wrong with the baby. I assured her everything was fine, and that we were going to have a healthy baby. She suddenly began convulsing violently. The doctor and nurses were trying to stop her heavy bleeding as she continued to thrash about on the table. 

When her heart monitor flat lined, she stopped moving, and the color of my wife’s face was drained. The doctor murmured to his team as he pulled out the baby with a wet sounding rip. I told them I wanted to see my child, but they refused. I fought my way through them and wrestled the bundle out of the doctors’ arms. 

What was in my arms was a writhing mass of larva feasting on the black and blue flesh of my first and only baby."

We flocked to the streets in unison, and fell to our knees, tears streaming down our faces. There lingered in each and everyone of us a sense of complete bliss, like we’d all swam in the liquid grace of God’s ruptured soul.

And maybe we had?

In our dream we all saw it. Buried deep underground. All coils and eyes and strange serpent-like patterns, centered in which was a perfect pulsating orb of flesh and sinew and tissue and skin.

Alive, but also dead. A construct, but also a living thing.

*The God Machine*, the Global Church of Scientific Affairs called it.  And with faith and logic finally united, interwoven then to search for an answer somewhere in between, humanity set out to retrieve the artefact.

It took years. It took millions of people working tirelessly around the clock. It took blood, sweat, tears, the collapse of world governments, and countless lives. But we found it. We unearthed it.

Reality changed and shifted and morphed. We all watched in awe as they dragged the *God Machine* up from the center of the Earth. Screeching. Writhing. Convulsing in pain.

Glorious.

Another year went by as Ordained Scientists did everything in their power to commune with the Machine. Assuming, wrongly of course, that it followed some logic our feeble minds could comprehend, they tried to power it, wire it, feed it…

“There is nothing *not* worth trying,” was the adage that catalyzed the discovery.

The Machine seemed to react to the unification of flesh. Human flesh. By fusing countless of unwilling subjects to the pulsating center - only one of whom survived -  they were finally able to get it talking.

But it would only speak two words.

They pressed and they prodded and they screamed and swore. They lashed and they stabbed and they cut open and tore. But all they got were the same two words. Over and over again, it was all that they heard.

*Etemen Ænka.*

*What does it mean? Is it broken? Can we fix it?*

Then it all ended the day humanity woke up from the *second* shared dream.

No flocking to the streets this time around. No tears. No falling to our knees. Instead we got up, emotionless, catatonic, and we started walking. We walked into the sea. We walked over cliffs. We walked and we walked until we could walk no more, and then we fell, and we never got back up again.

I say *we*, but I’m afraid I wasn’t in a state in which I could move, much less get up and walk. Fused with the core, as one with the orb, as a part of *the God Machine*, I could have told them what it meant. I could have warned them.

Alas, I am but a beacon. A messenger. My task was never to commune.

Instead, I look to the sky, and I wait.

We should all be the same then, right? I mean, in the grand scheme. 

Well, I was born different. Ugly is what the kids say. The adults say special, unique, in a way, beaut—  

They’d never finish that one with a straight face. I can’t blame them really. My face isn’t very straight after all. The lie would feel like mockery and I’d just as soon not. 

My face droops on one side, flesh thrown over bone like a wet shirt or one of Dali’s clocks. I have a mirror in my room. I know what everyone sees, but they must know *I know*. Their cruelty burns, it’s unnecessary, mean, but it’s a candle against my own judgmental sun. 

*Star stuff…*

I thought about that as I looked at one—a star—hanging alone in the evening sky. It might’ve been Venus, but I wished on it all the same. *Wish I may, wish I might*—that whole thing. I felt different, so I wished to be more like *them*. And when that star winked its quiet acknowledgement, I felt pretty for the first time in my life. 

The next few days went by quickly. I went to school, to the grocery store, to the movies. I tried to smile and watched the reactions. Jaws dropped, blood oozed from slick lesions, puzzled people scratched their heads and pulled back clumps of clinging hair.  They stared with eyes like shucked oysters and you know what? I felt fucking pretty. 

Now, I don’t hear “ugly” anymore. I don’t hear innuendo. I hear the staticky cackle of my inner radiance on a Geiger counter I snatched up from a pawnshop. 

Feeling down but looking up, I had wished to be more like them. Not the people—they were terrible. The stars. But really, in the grand scheme, it’s kind of all the same, isn’t it?  

We’re all star stuff.

Face darkened by the gloom

I pleaded that he would answer

And that his answer would come soon


""There's something thats outside""

Something flitted past the window

My legs began to shake


Dad barely moved a muscle

He did not move an inch

Then I heard the growling

But he did not even flinch


""There's something that's outside""

As I heard scratching at the door

My heart pounded in my chest

I couldn't take this an more


Finally he rose

But I could still not see his face

I thought I'd be relieved 

But my heart picked up the pace


""There is nothing that's outside 

That you should have to fear

The real danger now

Is in here with you my dear""


""You see, I am not your father

He's stashed up in the loft

And I thought you would have noticed

But I see your heads too soft""


Finally I saw

Past the shadows cloak

Outside fell so silent

Inside the silence broke


""So don't worry what is waiting

Beyond your own front door

As you will not be leaving

But will stay in here forever more"""

I remember my mother telling me and my brother, Eric that it was a special tree, it had been her Christmas tree growing up, and her mother's before that. It never withered, it always looked fresh and healthy. Our mother told us that every Christmas Eve if you leave an offering under the tree, you will find a present the next morning in its place. The present was always made from the same material as the offering.


She was right! On Christmas Eve she left a pile of wood underneath the tree, and upon waking up the next morning. We found two wooden nutcrackers fully painted under the tree where the pile of wood had been. Me and my brother were in awe. Our mother thanked the tree, and told us to do the same. And we did.


Next Christmas Eve me and my brother left a pile of broken electronics, and some scratched discs underneath the tree, and upon waking up we discovered a brand new looking Playstation 2, and a copy of Ratchet And Clank. Our mouths widened in a big smile upon seeing the console under the tree. We both thanked the giving tree, and proceeded to play the Playstation all day. And when we was laying in bed we spoke about the tree...


""What do you think would happen if a person was left under the tree as an offering?"" Eric asked.


""I don't know,"" I replied.


Many years passed, and when me and Eric were both teenagers we had become more skeptical of the giving tree, especially Eric. We didn't believe in magic anymore. Though our mother still insisted on tradition. Eric believed that our mother was putting the items under the tree, and the reason it never withered was because it was made from plastic. He wanted to see it with his own eyes, to witness the giving tree in action in order to believe, so on Christmas Eve he told me of his plan. He was going to stay up all night watching the tree.


When night came, and our mother was asleep Eric snuck out of bed, and headed downstairs to the living room where the giving tree was. I was too tired to follow him, so I went to sleep.


I was woke up the next morning to the sound of my mother screaming. I quickly shot out of bed and rushed downstairs to the living room. My mother was on her knees by the tree sobbing into her hands. My heart began to beat fast, and my eyes widened with shock upon looking under the giving tree. Underneath the tree was a lifesize doll made of skin that had been crudely stitched together…


It looked just like Eric!"

Those brat, heathen kids would run him down on their bikes, armed with rocks or whatever they found to throw at him along the street. Sometimes he made it to the apartment building before they could reach him, but there were plenty of times that he didn't and was pelted with rocks and cans until he could scramble his way through the door.

He assumed that they didn't like him because of his reclusive behavior. He kept to himself all the time and avoided people whenever possible. They made fun of his name. A name he had chosen when he moved to this country, escaping his dark past of hunger, desperation and depravity. From where he came he would be grateful for a bag of beans to get by. They waste so much in this country.

""Franks n Beans"" they would call him. ""Frankie Beanee had a small penee"" they would chant. Hurling insults and stones his way. The light flickered overhead. It gave the room he was in a sick depiction of a mind gone mad with recollection and ill intent.

""Franks n beans"" he chuckled as he stirred the contents of the pot in front of him. ""Their fingers kinda do look like little sausages,"" he mused as he stirred. He gave a glazed stare as he moved the wooden spoon around and around the big batch of baked beans on the stove. Human digits bobbed and bounced in the beans he was heating for dinner."

A few weeks ago I’d started experiencing extreme vertigo along with a variety of other symptoms, symptoms like impaired speech and short-term memory loss. At my request, my wife had taken me to the hospital; a week or so later (and after a fairly straightforward medication-based regimen), the symptoms had abated, and back home I went.

About a week later, my wife noticed that I’d started presenting the same symptoms to a lesser degree. I consulted with my physician, and we agreed that I’d be fine staying at home. He agreed to send a nurse twice a day to take care of my “medication” needs, and my wife could take care of me otherwise. She was a nurturer by nature, after all, and was more than happy to look after me.

So, every day the nurse would come in the morning to start me on my medication, and then my wife would go to work. I’d be alone until noon, when my wife would come home to bring me lunch, usually some type of soup, something that would be easy on my digestive tract.

Of course, I never ate the lunch she made; I’d wait until she’d gone back to work, and then I’d go to the kitchen and make myself a pastrami sandwich or some such.

Several weeks into this routine, my wife had become concerned. Not only had she not detected any improvement (or deterioration) in my condition, she had begun to feel rather poorly herself. I felt a little guilty for having kept secrets from her, but . . . well . . . I’m pretty sure she’d been keeping secrets from me. You see, my doctor had told me I’d been suffering from mercury poisoning before (and being a buddy of mine, this was a fact he’d agreed not to share with my wife). Coincidentally, my wife works at a lab where she has access to mercury. Hmmmm . . .

Being the bad husband I was, there were probably a few other little details I’d been keeping from her. For instance, every morning she’d make herself a cup of coffee and set in on the nightstand before taking her shower. Turns out we’d had a half-empty jug of antifreeze in the garage, and I might’ve brought a flask of it into our bedroom—and it’s possible that I might’ve been putting a few drops of it in her coffee every morning. I also haven’t told her that I’ve been faking my symptoms this second go around, nor have I told her that I took out a life insurance policy on her to match the one she took out on me.

I’m thinking tomorrow I might up her daily dose. I hear there are extreme temperatures where she’s headed, after all."

A heartbeat.

I live out in the middle of nowhere. No neighbors within sight. No businesses. No avalanching mountains. No stampedes. Only very rarely do I see a vehicle drive by. And If what I’ve been experiencing is an earthquake, then it’s been long and slow; and rhythmic. 

One late morning, I decided to stick a shovel into the dirt and see what I could uncover. But something strange happened when I pierced the earth.

The heartbeat quickened.

I immediately stopped digging and stood there gazing fixedly at the thumping land. As I did so, all that sang and chirped and clicked, fell silent, and dark clouds rolled in, turning the bright, sunny morning to one shadowed and gray. 

There’d been no call for weather of that kind. 

Nervously, I lifted the shovel, then, with all my strength, thrust the sharpened head into the ground once more.

The sky bellowed overhead; the subterranean throbbing grew more rapid. 

The land is alive; I’m sure of it. And not just the land, but the sky above, too. The two of them, seemingly intertwined. Maybe as allies, maybe as a single entity. Or maybe, as outrageous as it may sound, the Earth itself is sentient.

I chose to heed the warning that day. To leave the land unmarked and hope that it would respond to me in kind. 

As I’d made my way back to the shed to put away a shovel which I might never use again, nature livened back up: the birds and insects resumed their songs, which sounded almost jubilant by then, and the land became iridescent like before, illuminated beneath the nooning sun. I glimpsed up towards the clear, blue sky. Under my feet; a calm, rhythmic pulse."

Our chipped wooden doors  faced eachother and the sound of their opening would often synchronize as Cecilia and I, despite having different jobs, leave for work at the same time.

Dhrish would be at school as his mother hussled in accepting clients eager for massages by blind people and by the time I get home from my office, I'd find the mother and son carrying groceries along with an invite for dinner which I happily accepted everytime.  

On my days of hosting though, we would notice how Dhrish would keep on looking up my ceiling, barely talking at all. Cecilia and I gave eachother questioning looks but as wine capped the night we'd often agree on the range of a child's imagination. 

The day the chilling truth came knocking on my door was when Cecilia asked for a favor to look after her boy as there had been an emergency at work. It was my day off so I said yes in a heartbeat, Dhrish was almost like a son to me after all.  

Black eyes trained on the ceiling again as I set up the ps4 in the hopes that it would keep the boy entertained. I trotted in the kitchen and came back carrying snacks, no game is complete without munchies after all.

I laid the chips on the table and asked Dhrish what he preferred. The boy didn't spare me a single glance and with a shaky voice he answered

""I want out of here. Can we please get out of here?""

I was taken aback by his reply but obliged nonetheless as tears started to rim in his eyes. The walk to the park didn't take too long and as soon as we sat down on a bench the little one started to cry and apologized. I assured him that it was ok as I held him close and that he could tell me what had been bothering him in my apartment that he kept looking up

""I keep looking up because..."" 

Dhrish trailed on as he sniffled, the pout on his trembling lips placed an ache in my chest that soon turned to dread

""something's crawling on your floor and it scares me that I couldn't look at it anymore. It pulled on my leg when you went to the kitchen that's why I asked to go out."" 

It felt like my tongue was non-existent at that moment as I found it so easy to believe Dhrish.

The sinking sun took my heart along with it at the confession of Dhrish and a sleepless night soon followed as memories of the scurrying sound at my childhood home filled my head...the sound that the adults dismissed and convinced me to be imaginary. 

As it had terrorized my hearing back then...maybe remembering had allowed it to come for my sight next."

As Millie left the more populated area she twisted her keys about in her pocket to make sure they were poked through her fingers in preparation.

Turning into a more residential area Millie’s heart rate picked up as she kept her head up and made sure she was constantly scanning the road ahead and behind of her.

Seeing a group of men ahead Millie double checked her surroundings, shifted her hand holding the keys within her pocket and ensured there was enough space to pass them by. Adrenaline flooded her body heightening her senses, her breath quickened, and her steps sped up.

Safely past, Millie turned into the last road before her own, keeping her awareness high she hurried on.

Suddenly from behind Millie heard someone calling out, “hey, hey, Millie? It’s me, Rob!” 

Slowing slightly, her body fully tense, Millie threw a glance over her shoulder.

Recognising the man approaching as her neighbour from across the road, Millie relaxed, she huffed out a small laugh and waved.

“Walk with you the rest of the way?” Rob asked.

“Sure.” Millie replied, her shoulders dropping and her hand releasing her grip on her keys.

But Marian had deliberately stepped out a little earlier. She couldn’t take it anymore, her toxic bully of a manager was damaging her soul. Alison was spewing lies about her performance, accusing her of adequacy and denying her leave request. Marian had felt the walls of her office spinning as she looked at Alison’s horrible face and vile mouth. She visualized herself snatching up the pen on her desk and jab it as far as she could into that disgusting mouth, bash the tape-holder into her head. The rage and hatred she felt towards Alison was making her dizzy and nauseous. She mumbled something, and pushed passed her out of their office. She could hear Alison voice ringing in her ears as she left. 

*Ding!* The elevator doors opened and Marian stepped in. She was by herself. She was slightly shaking from the encounter, her mind furiously replaying their last dreadful conversation and she just stood there- forgetting to press a button. The elevator doors slid shut. Marian leaned against the mirror. 

*Ding!* Marian jerked upright as the elevator doors opened. Oh god Alison was there, but she never took her lunch so early- oh it wasn’t Alison, another woman, she stepped close and Marian screamed- her pen from her desk was stabbed into the woman’s open mouth, lodged in the roof of her mouth. 

The woman could still talk “Help me Marian“ and took another step towards her. Marian dropped her folders buried her face in her hands “No!” she gasped and heard the elevator doors slide close. 

*Ding!* Marian was alone in the stationary elevator, even though the doors were closed. Still shaking, she pressed the button for ground floor, and the elevator jolted into movement, only to stop after ten seconds, apparently between two floors. “No no no, please” muttered Marian reaching for the red alarm button.

*Ding!* The doors slid open and once more the woman stepped in from the darkness behind her. There was no pen stuck in her mouth but the side of her head was completely bashed in, her skull caved in and her eye on that side bruised shut and bleeding. 

The woman held out the tape-holder from Marian’s desk, dripping with blood. “Here is your tape-holder Marian”. 

Marian stepped back into the corner of the elevator, staring helplessly at the woman who repeated “Your tape-holder, Marian” and took another step towards her- Marian could clearly see the gaping wound by her temple. 

*Ding!* The door closed and the elevator jerked upwards, Marian pushed passed the woman and jabbed the alarm button so hard it popped out.

I want to live my life the way I want to live it and not be controlled by others. Sometimes others expectations of me are just damn right impossible and that's the thing with expectations, they are the catalysts for disappointments. My friend expected me to one day turn into a bird and he held his breath up until I turn into an actual bird. I told him not to hold his breath but he did. He eventually collapsed to the ground but was still holding onto his breath and eventually died. 

Then I had my parents expecting me to rule another planet in the universe, and I told them how stupidly impossible that was. They wanted me to one day rule a planet all to myself with statues made of me. They then held thier own breaths and will only let go until I managed to rule a planet all to myself. I begged them to stop but they kept on holding thier breaths, even to the point they had both turned to a different colour. They died and I tried to make them breath but they just wouldn't do it. 

Then I had two police officers expecting me to one day murder someone that simply doesn't exist and I explained to them how that would be impossible. How can you murder someone that doesn't exist, and the two police officers held their breaths and this time I simply didn't care. If they wanted to hold their breaths for something impossible then it was on them and when the two police officers died while holding thier breaths, an idea came to me. Everyone has potential to create babies and by killing someone you also kill thier potential children that don't exist yet. 

So I had started watching a man who had tried to commit suicide but failing multiple times, and then the fifth time he handcuffed himself to a tree and threw away the key.

 His shadow spills into the threshold and a shiver creeps down my spine. My mind goes numb with fear, the stench of it fills his nostrils and enraptures his blood lust. He’s close now… his black fur smooth and sleek, claws out and teeth bared. My legs quiver with the urge to run, but not yet… not yet. The timing must be perfect or else…

 He draws closer, I don’t risk moving an inch. Is this my end? Has my reckoning come to pass? Does death dare to collect me now? 

 God showed mercy on me then, a sound erupts from the kitchen. The ice maker settling in the fridge, dropping cubes into the basin. The creature turns his head to look back just for a second, giving me the window I needed to escape. 

 I scurry as quickly as my legs would take me, running faster than I ever have. He recoils in surprise, another hesitation, a terrible mistake on his part. I’m already outside the doorway and halfway through the kitchen before he gives chase. 

 The sound of him hurdling behind me fills my ears with thunder, but I never look back. A high-speed murder machine quickly closes the distance, right on my heels. I can almost feel his hot breath on my neck, but I’m almost there. Almost to safety. 

 But just as quickly as hope had lit my path, it had suddenly been snuffed out. A searing pain streaked across my back until I felt my spine snap in two with a sickening *crack,* and then nothing… I couldn’t move, I couldn’t feel my legs. The monster came to lay beside me, licking his paws smugly. He began to purr as the bell jingled around his neck. *Mr. Sprinkles* was stamped in ruby red lettering on his collar.

Even now, at twenty-three, I cannot sleep without a light on. It's irrational, I know that, but my mind imagines the shadows as harbouring dead, anguished things that want to drag me away.

Therapy worked for a short while, glad that somebody was treating my fears seriously rather than writing me off as childish or a drama queen. Of course, the weekly discussions turned into a pointless echo chamber. Medication helps me now.

I am a surveyor by trade, inspecting people's properties prior to sale; subsidence, heave, disjointed brickwork pointing to unusual movement - that kind of thing. The area in which I work is mostly composed of clay soil, brought about from considerable reclamation back in the 19th century. With clay, however, always comes movement.

As a result, fossils and remnants of a bizarre marine past are sometimes found during construction and passed to avaricious museums. It's hard to imagine this town once being completely underwater.

The property I went to inspect on the day it all began was on the old Acker Estate. The bungalow was in a terrible condition, the décor decades old, the Hessian wallpaper and polystyrene ceiling tiles yellow and tarred from heavy smoking. Hung on every wall were framed sketches of a woman. They were all titled *Missing Mrs. Hauser.* I figured she was the previous owner's wife. Her beauty was detailed with such care it made me smile. She was clearly loved and missed very much.

As I surveyed each room, I noticed one was still locked. Sorting through the house keys I unlocked it and entered. The room was empty, the curtains drawn aside. The sunlight didn't reach the far corner of the room but this wasn't unusual; all houses have dark corners - as I well knew.

The peculiar thing was that this corner was a deep, inky black. I took a photo of it with my phone but when I viewed it there was no darkness at all; I could see the wall and skirting boards quite clearly.

Then I heard scratching noises. They were coming from the depths of that unlit corner.

Frightened, I left the room immediately and asked the estate agent to take a look. Joe often came with me on inspections and agreed to check. When we entered the room all four corners were devoid of shadow. He nudged me on the arm and we both laughed. A trick of the light and my phobia. I passed the survey and the house was prepared for auction.

Weeks later, the family who moved in lost their young son. Asleep in his bedroom - in that room - he simply vanished. He was never found.

They sold the house soon after and I went back to see if I had imagined it all.

I had not.

Leaning down I could hear the scraping of tiny hands coming from the dark corner of that room desperately trying to get out."

Eventually the bushes clear up to a small courtyard with a fountain in the middle, a silver pitcher lying near it. Flowers blossom around the courtyard, red roses and pretty petunias. Crystal-clear water tinkles as it flows downwards.
 
Next to the fountain is a young maiden, no older than twenty. Her face is as pale as death, her lips parched. She is barely breathing.
 
I use the last of my strength to rush to her, and nearly collapse by her side. She is drop-dead gorgeous. Her brown hair is held up with a silver hairband, and her nose is petite. She is wearing a white dress that shines in the sun.
 
I pick up the jug and fill it with water, then hold it towards her lips. She drinks weakly, her face beaded with sweat. Then I refill the jug and have a drink myself. The water slides down my throat like ice-cold lemonade.

I caress her face. “We’ll be out soon, I promise.” I whisper.
 
Howls and barks break me out of my spell.
 
I turn around to see big black mutts burst out of the bushes. They shake their heads, drool flying in all directions, and bear sharp white teeth.
 
The silver pitcher clatters to the floor. I try to run, but the bushes are now a smooth green wall. No way out.
 
 I can only watch helplessly as the dogs howl in delight and pounce. Their claws rake my flesh; their teeth sink into my bone. Blood and guts explode everywhere. The pain is agonising.
 
Death is merciful.
 
***
 
I wake up again, exactly where I have started before. The maze stretches before me, its passages twisting into every corner.
 
The face of the girl is burned into my mind. Nothing else matters except for her. I know I have to save her from this hell.
 
The dogs howl behind me. Their teeth grind in anticipation.
 
I grit my teeth and start back into the maze.
 
*I’m coming for you*  I think. *And we’ll be out of here together.*"

But then he became insane for some time

His speeches were not exactly refined

I then knew that he was not in his prime

&#x200B;

I was in a rocking chair drinking tea

Only at that specific time I see

His boat wavering side-to-side like leaves

Then I saw him sink, with nothing to breathe

&#x200B;

I yelled and screamed for everyone to hear

I told what happened right inside their ears

They grab a net and face the deep frontier

Only then, did we save him as we fear

&#x200B;

Tommy then let out a shake and loud cry

This made people disgusted and surprised

I asked him “Did something happen big guy?”

He told me a story, nothing in rhyme

&#x200B;

“The sea, the vast, empty, lifeless void that is the sea, I saw it, yet I saw nothing. It’s filled to the brim with black holes, tearing out any sort of visible light in front of my own eyes. The sheet of darkness covering me has made me blind, I could not conceive any sort of idea or thought in the large field other than the concern for my salt-filled lungs.

The noises, oh God the noises David, they’ve taunted me. The expansive beach was homed with the noises of the great depths, the critters that ruled the sea. The noises were astronomically loud, they are ringing right now, they are laughing loudly inside my mind. They are indescribable noises, they frighten my soul with their savage roars, a bell for their feast.

Only then, I have now looked down upon the depths.

There were no creatures or animals, no signs of polyps or eventual reefs, no clean water being breathe through gills or waiting in lungs, no elegant swimming or little bubbles rising from the black sea.

Except for teeth. The twisted, human teeth, shining white and bright, contrasting against the dreadful darkness. It smiles at me, enjoying the malevolence of the waves pulling me down, spinning in fear. It was as big and expansive as my eyes looking into the horizon.

The teeth did not open, yet it talked to me, it taunted me, it laughed at me, it whispered to me, whispering incomprehensible muttering inside my own ears.

Before long, I heard its mumbling speeches, what it was saying.”

&#x200B;

 A rollercoaster of emotions hit

My heart had fallen into the deep pit

Curious and concerned, I asked Tommy

“What did the ‘Teeth’ whisper to you buddy?”

&#x200B;

“It said, “Let any mere mortal who sees my jaws be lectured by my name and its meaning, for their faith will be cut short. The fears of the seas and the violence of nature that I so create and watching it work, to work so that I may feast on victims like you, Tommy. I am ‘Faucibus’, the great devourer of the ocean. """""

Oh no, I must’ve been sleeping all through the day again. I got out of bed, trudging through the mess of clothes and toys on the floor and made my way to the lounge room. Where is that kid?

“Timmy, where are you honey?” I said out loud. He must be hungry by now.

As I entered the lounge room I saw Timmy standing in the middle of the room. It didn’t quite click at first, but there was something strange about the way he was standing. Somehow, straighter? 

“Hi babe, what are you watching?” I asked Timmy.

To my surprise he turned towards me, but not in the usual clumsy way that six-year old’s move their bodies.

“Are you alright Tim, are you hungry?” I asked. But he didn’t answer my question. Instead, he spoke in such a way that I’d never heard him speak before. 

“Mom, what day is it today?” he asked me without a trace of a lisp in his voice.

“Um, it’s Tuesday honey,” I replied.

“No, what’s the date?” he asked more forcefully.

“Timmy, why do you need to know …”

“Shut the fuck up and listen to me!” he yelled.

“Timmy, we don’t use words like that …”

“Listen!” he said again, this time he started walking towards me, his gait that of a much older person, “Is today the 15th of February, 1992?”

I had to think for a moment, “Yes, yes it is Tim.”

“Son of a bitch, it worked,” he muttered to himself under his breath. 

“Tim, what’s going on, are you OK?”

He again looked up at me. “Mom, you have to listen to me. This won’t make sense. I’m not six. I’m thirty-five. I travelled back. Please listen. Tonight dad is going to …”

“Timmy, are you sick?” I asked. The situation was getting me more confused and anxious. I really needed a fix. 

“Mom, please listen to me,” the sternness from his voice was gone and now he was pleading, “Tonight, dad is going to come home and he is going to kill you. You have to leave. Take the car and go anywhere but here. I know you’re not talking to grandma, but she will take you in. I promise.”

I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t answer him, instead I turned around and made my way to the bathroom.

“Mom, stop!” he yelled, “No more fucking drugs! Please, we have to go!”

I still couldn’t respond, my mind was in a blur. 

Suddenly I heard a thump on the door. 

“Maureen, let me fucking in!” a man’s voice yelled, “I want to see my fucking son! You stupid bitch!”

He started kicking at the door.

“I’m gonna break this goddam door down! Maureen, let me in!”

I was in a panic. I looked over at Timmy and he sat down on the floor, tears in his eyes. 

“It’s too late.”"

Right there. The street lamp.

See that? That odd, synced malfunctioning? Hypnotic, ain't it? How it flashes like a Jacob's Ladder in that horrific quantized way.

A way that tells us that we should go.

First time I saw it was last spring. Didn't bother me a bit until others started malfunctioning in sync as the weeks went on. But looking it up on the city's engineering and planning website, I figured it was just how new LED lamps went. Probably a bad batch from the plant. Some of them were even purple, almost like a blacklight.

Until I saw one of the old, green, mercury-vapor lamps start doing it, too. Then others. Then a few of *those* turned purple.

The weird thing is, it seemed like nobody cared. There was nothing on the news about it. Nothing in the paper. No social media posts. In fact, it seemed like I was the only one noticing.

What really got me upset is how each time I saw a new zombie light, my gut roiled in fear. Like I just...knew.

But now you're here. And you see it. And you care. And you know that this is the first sign that things are about to get very, very wrong.

There isn't a code for this. No virus. It's just organic. You and I both know that things are already taking place. Things that we can't see. Things that we can't *know*.

These lights. They're the first sign.

And we need to leave. Now."

""Jesus, Barry, you don't know what a kidney looks like?""
""I didn't think it was that small.""
""Never mind, she's still got the other one. She'll never find out. Not unless, you know, she decides to donate one.""

Another laughter.

'What the hell are they talking about?' Susan asked herself. She felt strange. In fact, she couldn't feel anything at all.

""God, look at this fatso. People like this don't deserve medicine.""

'Are they talking about me?', she wondered, best by a mixture of shame and anger. Suddenly, it dawned upon her, she had woken up mid surgery. Thankfully, she wasn't feeling any pain.

Another voice spoke, ""What's that thing there? That lump?""
""To tell you the truth, we don't know what a lot of these things do. As long as it's not bleeding we leave it alone.""

Susan could not believe she was hearing this conversation. These are surgeons?

""This beast here has a man, did you see him? Another Kentucky Fried Donut creature …""
""Just imagine what their lives are like.""
""I'm sure they're happy in their little mud patch.""

Giggles.

""We can tell them to check the nutrition content on the food packets but, you know, they're probably illiterate.""

By now Susan was full up with rage but couldn't move even the tip of her tongue.

Someone blurted out, ""Wake up, Garry! How anyone can fall asleep while standing up like that, I'll never know.""
""Sorry, I think I'm still a little drunk.""
""For Christ's sake, Garry.""

'This is a dream, it must be', Susan prayed, 'I'm just having one of those dream where I know I'm dreaming. This can't be happening in real life.'

""So this Mr Donut Man came up to me before, all teary eyed, 'oh Doctor, she's all I have. Well, that doesn't surprise me. A dog wouldn't lower itself to staying with a thing like that.'

More giggles.

'When I'm up, I'm going to d sue every one of these bastards. What did they say about my kidney? Oh god', a maelstrom of fury and alarm rampaged through Susan's mind.

""We'll stitch this fatty up now but she'll be back in a couple of years. These types can't be helped. I should just put her out of her misery right now. Frankly, I'd do that with the lot of them if it wasn't for my god damned insurance premium which is high enough as it is.""
""Yeah, those leeches.""

Susan was now fearing for her life.

""We're done now with this blob. Let's go have some lunch … wait, is that her blood pressure?""
""Shit, why is it so low?""
""And it's dropping.""
""Damn it. Get some adrenaline, quick!""

""Only been used once. Found them at an old house collection. Strange thing, that house. Haunted. Don't mind telling you I was out of there as quickly as I could.""

He handed me them back, and charged the till. I read the logo on the side. *CRAY CRAY CRAYONS* funny, I thought. They must have had a sense of humor back then. 

The tale followed me home. I told my wife and gave my son the crayons. He's always loved to draw. Ever since he was little. Stick man. Stick animals. Trees and sunshine. The normal, but as he's got older his skill has improved. 

""Why don't you get off that computer and do something nice for Nancy?"" I said, handing him the crayons. 

""Like what?"" 

""I don't know. Do a mural on her wall or something. She'd love to see that when she gets back from the hospital.""

Nancy had fallen I'll with a week earlier. But she had gotten better and was due out. My son reluctantly shut off the computer and went upstairs. 

""I've got to pop out, David. I'll be back in a few hours.""

David stopped, nodded and disappeared around the landing. 

Later that day I came home to an empty house. It was cold, like nobody had lived in it for years. I called out to my family. But no one answered. The lights were on, the tv blaring to itself. Cold plates of half eaten food laid on the table. Room by room I searched the house, Until I came to Nancy's room. 

There on the carpet was the reminisce of coloured dust. The crayons were beside them, half eaten by the wall. And above them, sprawled in realistic poses were my wife, David and little Nancy. 

I sat, dazed as they moved around. Shimmering in the colours of the crayons. The old man's tale came back to me. How he had found the crayons in a house he deemed haunted. I knew then it wasn't haunted. They crayons had done the same thing here. Took the people painted on the wall and sucked then inside. 

As I write this, I'm steading my hand. For the first time in years I'm going to pick up a crayon and draw myself in. It's the only way to be with them."

I heard those words in a dream before I woke up.

The cabin was cold, the forest was silent.

“Have to fuel the fire:”, I thought.

“Can’t let it die”

And so I went to gather wood from the forest. The ancient trees looked down at me with amusement.

That is until I struck one down.

And so a tree fell with great dramatic grace. A violent creek of wood piercing the cold air.

The woods screamed in outrage at my crime.

The first task was complete.

Now I thought something else. “I need food”

And so I left the axe by the cabin and took up my rifle.

All the world stared at me in fear, hiding in bushes behind the great oaks and maples.

I spotted a rabbit.

A single shot broke the eerie quiet and a beautiful vibrant red colored the earth.

I ate the creature raw, soft fur and bones all. It would have been equally criminal to cook it. Both options horrific crimes against existence itself.

Because that dream I had so many years ago, it told me the truth.

The voice in the dream said we were in fact creations of God, but that we had become confused.

It said that we were descendants of lucifer, not Adam.

Those beings called humans were real, but they existed in a place far away. And we were not them, we were but demons, what we had thought was the earth was in reality hell.

I didn’t believe the voice at first.

But as the years wore on in my isolation it began to make sense, I finally saw the truth.

That's why I kill them now, why I hunt demons.

If ever a car breaks down on the highway, I kill the passengers, take the pelts, and preserve the meat.

It’s my great mission.

Sometimes the demon soldiers with their red and blue, almost find me, alone and hiding.

But they haven’t yet.

And so I will continue killing demons, the young and old, any I should find.

I’ll keep on killing until I purge all of hell."

I saw him because I was there. 

I saw the heavens open, a golden light shining through.
It shone so brightly and so elegantly, I remember thinking that that surely must be the work of a God. Who knew I would be right? 

He appeared, not long after the light penetrated the clouds, clad in an all-white robe, descending from the sky.

It seemed like he wanted the world to embrace him. To feel his presence. I remember seeing people falling to their knees.To them The Book of Revelation has come to pass. God himself was here. 

He looked much more human than I suspected he would look like. I swear in that moment he looked mortal, he looked like he could be hurt.

Ironic, you have to laugh at the absurdity of it all. The omnipresent all powerful looked like he could be hurt. 

At first, I didn't understand; I couldn't comprehend why the great man himself was paying us a visit. 
It seemed like we were worth his time after all, I remember thinking about how the world would be changed, how science can't deny this. 

I knew and everyone else knew. 

Today we met God. 

My thoughts didn't even get the chance to turn cold when I saw the black creatures flooding out of the golden light. They came out in streams of thousands, showing no hint of stopping. I could only stare and watch as they started feasting upon the angels.

In that moment I knew that I was experiencing my final moments.
My last final whisper.

Funny enough, my inevitable and soon to be demise didn’t trouble me the most. Neither did the demons and all their kin flooding through, destroying everything in their wake. 
What really troubled me down to my raw and naked soul was his face. 

When I saw it, I knew there was no hope. God himself was powerless. I knew that from the moment I looked into his eyes.

His eyes that made it quite evident that he wasn't paying us a visit, he was simply running away. 

The day humanity met God there wasn't time to celebrate and bask in the great reveal, because the day humanity met God, he himself was crying."

I charter a plane to the Andes in just over two weeks. It was not easy to gain such a large favor, but I have a few friends and a little influence left over.


Nobody is sure what to call it. The fact is, unfortunately, few in the scientific community believe it exists. By now, I should have more belief in the field, but this is a World of, “what are your successes right now,” and I admit being on a slow runway. It should not matter, though; in twenty-eight years *I* documented thirteen creatures thought to be figments of the imagination and camera ghosts.



From the Himalayas to the Outback, from Congolese jungles to The Mariana Trench, each was a success. I could have any resource I wanted. Until I was wrong, *one time.* New Guinea was a trouble, I will confess. And when I found nothing there, it was disappointing. But thirteen out of fourteen would favor you for the Super Bowl. Why not a little faith in me again?


It does not matter; I have the plane and my other resources. The Andes await.


I call it, “Monster.” Granted, unoriginal, but given there are not even shaky photographs, or a partial print in the snowy dirt, I have no basis of reference. Why then, my, “colleagues” have asked, do I believe in this creature?


Three eviscerated human bodies have something to do with it.


Anybody in the scientific community can tell you about the ’83 Aconcagua expedition. On their own reports, four investigators trekked the mountainside, only for three-quarters of them to be recovered six months later. The autopsy was, “somewhat inconclusive” due to the elements, but preservation determined one inarguable fact: they were violently skinned alive by, “something of animalistic resemblance.” In my own research, I found two virtually identical incidents, both involving amateur groups in the early ‘00s, and both missing at least one attendee altogether.


Of course I am not going unprepared. I do not want to kill anything, but I *do* want to avoid being unzipped like a build-a-bear. I am unsure how I could possibly combat a life-form capable of subduing three experienced explorers, and peeling them to the muscle *before* they died, but at least I know what to expect. And over two weeks, I can formulate something.


I feel a certain foreboding, embarking on this quest. All my discoveries had been intimidating- and the Nandi Bears found *me* before I found them- but they were all something with a dossier, of sorts. None of the other creatures were known *only* through their vicious killing of multiple humans.


Maybe it just wants to be left alone.


It does grant me a morbid privilege. Either I prove the Monster exists, and redeem myself in the process, or you found this in my personal possessions.


If the latter is the case, know that I smiled among my screams, for I was right all along.

We were both fresh out of undergraduate, curious about the world and had too much of the typical Californian college boy energy.

The plan is to fly to Kathmandu, then to Lukla, and hopefully trek our way to the small settlement of Gorakshep where we can camp with the other climbers.

""Did you know that 'Gorakshep' means 'dead ravens'?"" Joshua flips through the tourist pamphlet excitedly. ""We can start towards *Kala Patthar* from here.""

By the time we arrived at the lodge, it's already dusk. After setting up the sleeping bags, we wandered around Gorakshep in search of the ""frozen lake"" the locals mentioned. We find it tucked between hard snow and jagged rocks, veins of ice crawling like marble tiles, it was beautiful.

""What the hell are those things?"" Joshua points.

They look like...stumps, or growths. Small, twisted pillars of ice reaching up vertically from the frozen lake. I can tell they've been there a long time, and the wind eroded away most of their shapes. Still, there's at least over a dozen, each about the length of an arm.

""Maybe it's some weird aerodynamic thing, like how the stones in the desert get sculpted into mesas?"" I shrug.

Neither the pamphlet nor the locals offer any explanation. After a quick dinner of protein bars, I notice Joshua packing up his hiking gear.

""Where are you going?""

""To the lake."" He announces, ""I want to see it again.""

""Are you crazy? It's almost dark.""

""Don't worry."" He clips a flashlight to his belt before heading out. Too tired and too cozy in my sleeping bag, I opt to just let him fuck around for a while.

He barges back into the lodge about 2 hours later, eyebrows frosted over from the cold and shuddering. ""It's too weird, man. I'm not going back there again. Those ice things, they were *fucking moving*, dude. They were moving.""

After a few sips of warm tea, he calms a little more. I don't hear him crawling back into his own sleeping bag before I fall asleep.

The next day welcomed sunlight warms over Gorakshep, and I set out to look for Joshua - he's already up and left.

My wandering takes me back to the frozen lake where the ice stumps are. This time, I take a better look at them.

I see fists.

There's a new one now, fingers still intact. This one has a mountaineer's glove on it.

I brush away the congealed snow and see Joshua's frozen face staring back at me. His single arm reaching up, the only thing to break the ice which swallowed him. His other palm pressed up underneath the surface, permanently trapped.

And I can *almost* hear him pounding against the ice when night comes."

Gigi had planned this hike for months and following a recent break-up I wholeheartedly agreed, nature heals after all. 

Talks about work, love, and life filled the space of that cantering and as we neared a small incline, I felt Gigi hold my hand that halted us both. 

I followed her line of sight, baffled as to why she looked horrified and when my vision travelled to the top of that incline, I could barely swallow as I gripped Gigi's hand back. 

A man faced sideways in a crouching position, on one hand was a leash and on the other held a stick. We heard the soft cooing noises he made as he patted the top of the head of his pet. 

It would've been adorable but it was gut wrenching instead since he wasn't petting a dog...he was petting a human. 

A scrawny dirty looking man whose ashen skin hugged his ribs with patches of scabs riddling his body with some clearly infected.

The collar that fitted his neck too tight wore years and years of use on its material as the man panted like an animal. 

Gigi released a small exhale as she whispered 
""back up slowly"" as our sight finally met. Her honey eyes were rimmed with tears as if apologizing for taking us here. 

A silence almost defeaning granted us to make very small steps only to be broken by the man's yell of ""Fetch!"" as he threw the stick that landed close to our feet. 

First came the paralyzing shock as the piece of wood landed with a resign then followed the fear as the scrawny man ran down on all fours all the while barking like a rabid creature while the other laughed like a madman.

Salvation came when adrenaline finally hit as Gigi and I sprinted without daring to look back as the ungodly sounds rang behind us. 

Our screams slashed the noise of the trees and drowned the song of the birds as we tripped here and there. Time felt like an enemy and death.

Tremors wrecked our bodies as we entered the car. Gigi dropped the keys once or twice, cursing for each fall, her voice broken as tears came like rain. 

Our lungs devoured oxygen like an aching hunger. The familiar sound of the vehicle starting came minutes later and with the shift of the gear, Gigi and I left that horror.

The trail got closed off to the public as the authorities set out an investigation and to our disappointment, they were never found. 

My apartment has become a prison as the barks outside my window had become too much and Gigi...Gigi had to put her dog in the care of her brother as even the soft panting caused her to break down.

She had skipped several classes (when was the last time she attended?) and needed to find out where the exam would be; to do that, she'd have to remember which course this was. She hoped she could find a schedule somewhere and recognize her class.

She should have kept up with coursework! Was it already too late? Had she locked in a failing grade? The university had called her back after graduation, listing a few credits that were required but missing, so there would be one more semester or two before she was actually free.

Maybe the tall brick building standing on a grassy hill had the information she needed; an administrator in an office, or even a listing tacked up on a billboard. She was looking for a way in. There were no doors at her level, but there appeared to be an entrance a few stories below, a vertiginous drop over a fence from where she stood. No way to get there directly from here. The other side of the building was a residence hall facing an empty courtyard. Another doorway beckoned, this time several stories above her. She was no closer to her goal.

""Sunita,"" said an older woman in a pantsuit. ""You're in a dream.""

Of course! She wanted so much for this to be true that it made immediate sense. ""Oh, thank god. Now I can wake up.""

""A few of us have been stuck here for a very long time. In the waking world, if we're alive or dead, there's no way to tell. But we need help. We need smart people. And this university is a good place to find them.""

""You said this is a dream,"" Sunita said, her confidence faltering.

""It is. We have figured out a way to get more people to stay. Topside, it will probably look like you never wake up.""

Sunita started to panic. ""No, no, no. Not in this nightmare. You can't do this!""

""We couldn't, not until recently. We didn't know how. We need you.""

Sunita looked around, at a campus she at once recognized and did not, feeling even more lost.

""It's different down here, but there are still rules. Before you can help us, you need to graduate. And that means passing your final. 

""I'll leave you to it,"" the woman said, and walked away."

I can remember her first words, as soon as we met. ""Now and forever, you are mine,"" she said. ""For all of your life, and through whatever comes next. I will choose for you, I will speak for you, I will breathe your every breath. You will still see through your eyes, but you will see only that which I allow. Your name is now Sess, for you are my possession.""


I am still my own mind, deep inside, but now my lover does everything for me. I am strapped snugly in the passenger seat, for the ride. And what a ride it has been. 


They say that the scariest part of any rollercoaster is the initial ascent; imagine that ascent never, ever ending. 


My mind is torn in half; I thrash and snap my shattered teeth towards the nurses who try their best to help me. One kind soul held a mirror to my face today, and begged me to see that I am still myself, but all I saw was my lover behind my wild, whitened eyes.


I smashed the mirror with my broken nose. Even my head is strapped down, now.


But what a ride. For once in my life, I felt I was wanted. Not needed; but being wanted seemed enough. 


But my lover spoke of absolutes; no romance, only truth. ""You need me,"" she seethes. ""I don't need you. I don't want you. You disgusting waste of flesh. Yes I speak of absolutes. My hatred for you is absolute. This broken body I now possess is unworthy of one such as me. I'll make sure you know nothing but pain, but isolation, but an interminable purgatory. I shall not speak to you again. These are the last words you'll hear, but your whimpers as you beg me to whisper any wretched word again, my Sess.""


I scream, on and off, in a voice no longer like my own; screams for a priest, but the sound is an animal's dying howl. I weep as I remember that I WANTED this. I offered my body, from sheer loneliness. I don't even know my lover's name, only my own."

The crows knew that humans lived in the basement at the end of the large backyard. Sometimes a thin hand would reach out of the small window at ground level, and leave scraps of food. Not very good food, but food all the same. Sometimes mice or cats would beat them to it, but other times the crows would hop up and scavenge the leftovers. 

That was how the crows heard the crying and pleading. Nothing much could be heard from their usual nesting spot on the trees at the far end of the backyard, but once they were close to the small window, they could hear the voices of the humans- always the same humans. They didn’t go close and look inside- they were firm believers in minding their own business- but then one time they heard a terrible scream, followed by a loud sharp sudden sound. They flew away. No good could come from those noises. 

A few days later, there was some scattered food outside the window again. They swooped up close, and couldn’t help glancing inside the dark inside of the basement through the ground window. There they saw humans shaped like women, at least two or maybe more. 

Then an angry male human came into the yard and spotted the little group of crows by the window. He yelled at them, brandishing a shotgun. They flapped off, cawing loudly. Fortunately the man didn’t go closer otherwise he might have spotted the food leftovers outside the window. He didn’t like birds, and the crows picked up on his fear. 

Time passed. The female humans never came out of the basement, but always left food for them. Then, one day, amongst the food scraps, the crows found something unusual. A human toe, fresh and bloody. 

They hopped closer to the window and looked in. A sickly yellow face was looking up, towards them. 

“Please. Take it. Take it to the police.”

There was some concern among the crows that if they took the toe as requested, the female humans would leave the basement, thus no more food. But these concerns were outweighed by their dislike of the angry man and his gun and their loyalty to the female humans whose hands had fed them for so long.  

And so they split in two groups. An elder crow flew towards the police station, carefully holding the toe in his beak, accompanied by one group. The others clustered around the window. Now that they had made it their business, they would see it through to the end. And when the man stormed into the yard with his shotgun, they flew straight at him. No shots were fired. 

The police cars drove up following the crows to backyard, at the same time as the man, screaming in agony, blood streaming down his eyeless face, stumbled into the street, trying to flee the murder of crows."

I’ve always been an explorer. Even when I was a kid I wasn't afraid of the dark. I had always wanted to explore the Catacombs of Paris, and on my 18th birthday, I got my wish. It all went smoothly for the first few hours, until my phone ran out of charge. I suddenly felt a piercing feeling race up my spine, as if something was watching me. My heart started racing. I ran through the tunnels as fast as my legs could carry me but the whole time I heard rhythmic footsteps. Never slowing down or speeding up. *Thump, thump, thump.* They always sounded like they were right behind me, but each time I looked, nothing was there. After running for what felt like hours, I had to rest. Then I heard them again. *Thump, thump, thump.*

I frantically looked around, but to no avail. I screamed out of pure panic; it echoed around for minutes. *Silence.* I thought I was hearing things, until my scream echoed back, deeper and distorted. *Thump, thump, thump.* In that moment, one singular thought burnt through my mind like a blazing inferno.

*I’m not alone.* I sped through the tunnels until I found a hole in the wall. A room. A room full of bones and corpses. The stench of rotten flesh crept up my nostrils and infected my nose. A low growl echoed from behind me and shivered up my spine.

I spun around at rapid speed to see a large shadowy humanoid with many tendrils reaching away from its body. I tried to scream for help but multiple tentacles covered my mouth, muffling me. More and more appendages wrapped around my limbs and pulled. Another deep snarl jumped out of the creature’s mouth and into mine. *This is where I die,* I thought to myself. And I was right. *What a way to go…*"

Birthdays are just so important in my life and I wish that I could just stop doing birthdays altogether but I don't think I can, because birthdays are now ritual celebrations in my life which everyone expects. The amount of money that I spend for birthdays and I always get frustrated when another birthday comes around. In January it was my rights arms birthday and my right arm is only 8 years old. My right arms enjoys the feeling of sharp expensive knives and letting out blood. 

Then on February it was my left legs birthday and my left leg is 98 years old and I really didn't want to celebrate it because of the birthday in January, but forced myself to do it. My left leg enjoys the feeling of being used to kick people in expensive shoes or trainers. I bought a stupidly expensive trainers so that my 98 year old left leg could be used to kick people. Then on the same month my 35 year right leg was the new birthday boy. My right leg also enjoyed kicking people in expensive trainers. 

Then on march it was my left arms birthday and my left arm was 20 years old, and my right arm enjoys punching people with expensive gloves. My right arm also enjoys poking people in the eyes and taking their eyes out. So my right arm got a hell of a birthday and as you could guess I was exhausted at that point with all the birthdays. Although more birthdays had to be done and I was a person who followed through culture. 

Then on April it was my neck and throats birthday and they were 45 years old. They enjoy the taste of a person who has lived well going the throat and neck and I treated them to a person like that. Then on the same month it was my tongues birthday and my tongue was 28 years old. How I keep up with the ages is beyond me. My tongue enjoyed seeing other people's tongues when they are screaming, and so I broke into people's houses and scaring them with a gun in my hand. My tongue got to see so many screaming tongues, especially when they saw thier loved ones being shot. 

The next birthday is for my heart and my heart is only 5 years old, my heart enjoys seeing other people's hearts."
rb23tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rb23tw/husbandry/,Husbandry,31,1,1638892196.0,"Farmer Del looked out on his livestock with a profound sadness. Yes, being a farmer meant that you accepted what life was for the livestock and life was death. Life was about being alive to feed others. Rarely did he even consider the sombreness of his trade. But today was different. He wondered the fields with his staff and threw down the slop that they would eat. Fattening them up for the slaughter.

Did they know their fate?  

A couple of them looked up upon him with a wistful sadness in their own eyes. Of course, they knew – Del thought.

But Del treated his stock with a kindness and consideration that was rare these days amongst others. He knew other land keepers that simply herded them into cramped cages and force fed them to the point of explosion and then slit their throats and drained the blood out while they were still alive.

Farmer Del had a different approach to husbandry. He let them roam free amongst the fields. He didn’t separate young from their mothers. No, Del had respect for the cattle.

Del wondered across the field and into the slaughter house. There was a fast action high speed killing machine with a nozzle that pumped out gas charged death into the brains of the stock.

He watched them lined up and then heard the FFFFUUUPPPP FFFUUUPPP FFFUUUPPP into their brains. The bodies collapsed on the floor and they were taken into the draining station. Del felt a sadness today. An empty sadness for the ‘cattle’.

Del went back into the house and grabbed himself a coffee. His wife stood there gazing upon him and she could sense the melancholy with which Del found himself drowning in.

“What is it dear?” Deborah asked.

“It’s all this killing. Is it really a necessary way to make a dollar?” Del said to Deborah.

“What has got you in this frame of mind?” Deborah said.

“I had a dream again. I think that started it. One of them escaped and scaled the fence with their youngens’ in tow. We caught it up to it half a mile down the road and I just remember that vivid image of the sad torment in their eyes.” Del said.

“Stupid.” Deborah said.

Del finished his coffee and walked back out to the fields. He knew Deborah meant. These weren’t beings on the same plateau as him. One of the stock ran up to the fence and Del ran towards it. It panted hard and fearfully.

“Sir, my child is very sick. Too sick to run the laps around the field that you asked. He just wants to rest today.” One of the pathetic humans said.

Del raised up his staff and clobbered it around the head.

“Get back to running the fields.” Del said.

Del’s wife approached with a fresh cup of blood.

“Looks like you could do with some dinner because sunrise. I got the coffin nice and warm for us.”  Deborah said."

“They didn’t show up on any marine radar system,” an anonymous fisherman stated. “It’s like they weren’t there.”

“And people started disappearing,” the fisherman claimed. “Anyone who asked questions.”

Rumours soon started spreading, and outlandish conspiracy theories were haphazardly woven at alarming rates, some of which catalyzed dangerous movements like “Storm the Poles” - an ill-fated crusade that led to the demise of half-a-dozen simpletons.

Countless theories, and not one of them even came close to the truth.

“Corpses,” Farhan Paswan, one of the researchers who later came forward, said. “We were transporting frozen corpses.”

With the steady melting of the permafrost, a stark and impossible discovery had been made. Thousands, millions, billions of solidly frozen human corpses started appearing *everywhere*.

“At first we figured it had to be some extinction event of old; maybe a lost civilization devastated by sudden climate change,” Paswan continued. “But it didn’t make sense. There were *way* too many of them. And then, uh…”

Doctor Kaito Nakagawa is still officially listed as *missing*. None of the old governments have ever gone on record to corroborate Farhan Paswan’s claims.

As we all know, Farhan Paswan, along with the remaining members of the *Truth Collective* was soon after arrested, charged with the brand new crime *treason against Humanity*. They are assumed dead, executed no doubt by one of the old governments. If it wasn’t for their bravery, the world would have never known.

Over the course of weeks, the Collective was able to smuggle out vital documents from the ever moving *Ice Fleet*, which, as we all know, led to the immediate global collapse of all major governments.

*Millions of frozen corpses unveiled in the melting polar caps reveal a HORRIFYING truth.*

“Sofija Ozols from Riga, Latvia was the first of the Frozen to be identified,” Paswan said. “Completely by chance really, a crew member knew her.”

They must have been frozen in the ice for thousands of years. Longer, probably. But they were *us*. Sofija Ozols was still very much alive. But there existed on the *Ice Fleet* another Sofija Ozols, an identical Sofija Ozols.

We got back to the hotel, and settling in for the night. My youngest  daughter says she want to read a little before bed, but she left her book in the car.

I grab the swipe card, throw shoes on, and travel down a few floors to ground, and out to the carpark.

Walking through the reasonably well-lit car park, I unlock my car, find the books, lock up and head back.

As I walk back, I see someone sitting a car, looking downward. I presume they're just on their phone. The path to the door goes right by their car.

As I walk along their car, I glanced into the side window, and they're not in the seat.

I shoot my eyes up to the door, quicken my pace, and head inside, trying to process what I'd just seen.

The lifts are past reception, so I saunter up and tell them what I'd just seen.

Without batting an eyelid, they say, ""Parking space 16? Where's your car"" as they spin a small computer screen around.

I point to my old car, and to the car that I walked past.

I traveled all over the world until I found what I was looking for, the Guerta catacombs, it was in Rome, a secret catacomb with only a few people knowing its location, I was going to make a documentary about it and so I had decided to find it a long time ago .

I broke the rules a little to be able to enter, climbed the iron gate and penetrated into the catacombs, for some reason entry into these catacombs was forbidden but I would not submit to such laws. 

When I entered I could admire the splendor of the catacomb, it had wide arcades that created a cobweb with narrow branches, full of tombs dug into the floor and somewhere a burial niche. 

In addition, the narrow galleries often starting from an older basement complex, form a dense grate, above which there would be two, three, or four floors that communicate with each other with narrow sloping levels. As I proceeded to the catacomb I saw that inside the walls were carved narrow horizontal tombs sealed with tiled or marble slabs. 

next to me there was a dark gallery and on the floor I could see a sign that said ""do not approach"", this aroused my curiosity and I decided to enter that gallery. As the gallery became more and more wet and dark , at one point I could not see anything and so I decided to go back. Suddenly I felt something hitting me in the head and I fell down on the floor unconscious. 

When I woke up I could see that I was tied with a rope to a wooden table in a polygonal room with two people wearing a plague doctor mask. There were painted pentacles on the walls and that made me realize the scary reality that I was going to experience.

They are religious, they believed that if you would simply pray it would go away. I wish it was that simple for me.

I gulped slowly and turned back around, it was just in my head. *Your Mind and I are the Same.* I laughed, I can’t believe me going insane was going to be added to the list of things wrong with me. *Shall I reveal myself to you?* I blinked and saw a flash of red next to me, I backed away slowly, still couldn’t believe that this was happening. I opened my eyes and I was struck. A figure with large, milk white wings, feathers that glistened in the moonlight. A tall being with nothing but a mouth and pearls wrapped around its torso. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve laid my eyes upon. *Be Afraid.* It had said in a deep reverent tone that shook me to my core. I stood in awe.  *I choose you, son of suffering, son of sin, be reborn.*  I walked home. Took the bread knife that I had just used to cut a bagel this morning. *T*h*E* H*O*u*S*e F*e*l*l* S*i*le*n*t.

Covered in blood, *was this the person I wanted to be?*  The being wrapped its wings around me. The feathers stung me when it contacted my skin.

I even called the police—they never found a scrap of him. Finally, they gave up looking—chalked it up to a man grown weary of living with an eccentric woman.

I took up painting as a way to cope with the loss, and turns out I’m pretty good. I had a teacher for a short while, but she told me early on that I had a natural flair, and that I was wasting both my time and money on her.

I eventually opened a little gallery where I sell my work and that of a few others in town who share my inclinations toward the macabre. The piece I’m just finishing now is of my husband lying naked on a thick plastic drop cloth draped across our bed, his hands and feet tied to the bedposts, his throat slit in a deep, straight line from ear to ear, blood cascading down his neck and onto his chest and shoulders. I call the piece *How a Husband Leaves His Wife*.

Looking at it now, I think I might’ve gone a little overboard with the drama, might’ve tapped into my anger a little too deeply—the fear in his eyes, his mouth frozen in an eternal gasp. I think I might’ve been remembering the times he hit me when I painted his expression—but I *never* hit him. *Never*. Not *ever*. I loved him.

*Oh well* . . .

As good a painter as people say I am, the thing that confounds me most is why—say, like a good writer can—I can’t create a vision for a painting in my imagination. I have to paint from life . . . or a photograph. I guess we all have our limits."

The television again: “We have with us tonight Dr. Linda Harvey, criminologist. Dr. Harvey, what exactly do you make of these gruesome murders?”

Another knock at the door. Linda eyes a knife at the edge of the counter.

“Thank you for having me. What’s interesting here is that the killings are so similar, the method so specific, yet the sheer number impossible for any one person.”

Jamie shuts the light off, but something’s wrong. 

Gripping the knife, Leah peers through the curtains. But it’s dark, only the moon offering illumination. 

“Are you suggesting there is more than one Moonlight Killer?”

A hand grabs his neck and forces Jamie to the ground, extinguishing his cigarette.

“With the number of deaths in so many locations, there may be upwards of thirty killers.”

Then she sees it: a hooded figure. Leah gasps, and the figure turns toward her.

“That sure is a terrifying story, Doctor. But isn’t that a little far fetched?”

A hooded man has Jamie by the throat. Another walks toward him wielding an axe.

“Well, I would say thirty-seven decapitations over the course of two weeks is a little far fetched, too.”

Leah screams as the man kicks down the door and runs at her with an axe. She dodges him and his axe gets lodged in the good furniture. 

Jamie hears the axe dragging on the concrete. He grabs the hands of the man strangling him, grips his pinkies and snaps them.

“And what do you suggest our viewers do to protect themselves?”

Leah sees the man struggling with the axe. Still screaming, she plunges the knife into his neck. 

The man howls and releases his grip. The other raises the axe but Jamie kicks him hard in the gut. He goes down. 

“Everyone should stay inside…”

Leah watches the blood spurt like a fountain.

“…and under no circumstances…”

Jamie takes the axe and hacks into him. The other tries to crawl away but Jamie grabs his ankle and pulls him back, his nails ripping against the concrete. 

“…attempt anything heroic.”"

After awhile, the purr and gentle meow of our cat by our side causes us to give them a scratch and pet, without even thinking about it. We do this while watching TV, while engrossed in our newest novel, during that 1 hour gab session with our best friend.

A whine and a bit of a snort, and we raise obediently from our couch and the latest mobile game to let the dog out.

At night, in our dreams, we gently hug our big dog, a scratch to the ears, a gentle sweep down the side.

Some of us, closer to our pets perhaps than others (or less afraid of hair and dirt) lift a corner of the blanket for our furry friends. We operate on sight and sound, a gentle brush of fur or soft whine or purr.

Rex was none of those. A gentle scratch on the covers, and up goes a corner for sleepy snuggles. I relished in this nightly trend.

A sense of calm surrounded me, and the warmth seeped into my bones as I would deeply breathe.

Tonight, I heard and felt the ""scratch scratch"". Half awake, I raised the covers. A fuzzy form lumbered in. 

The usual warmth felt off somehow tonight.

Every kid and adult alike will be soaking up the festive season. But there was a time back in 1984 when the festive season should have been called the frightful season. 

We are still not sure how it happened. There was a new toy set to be all the rage being manufactured in the elf factory. A beacon of brilliance. A toy to top all other toys. A masterpiece in engineering. It was a speaking, interactive doll. 

To say we hit big wouldn't be right. Thousands of these toys were earmarked and shipped out to eager children. The trees were full that year. Homes were merry and joyous. Everything changed Christmas morning. 

We don't know who programmed the dolls with a secret message. It wasn't a glitch. We know that much. 

A few hundred children upon opening and playing with the toy didn't find the hidden message. Call it dumb luck. 

A smattering of the most fortunate ceased playing with the dolls. In fact, they cease to do anything. They didn't respond to their names. Didn't bother to move anymore. Didn't converse or even move unless propelled. 

A couple of thousand found the message and went into a blind panic. They ripped anything they could find apart. Their sibling's presents. Their pets. Even their siblings. 

A few thousand got it bad. One minute they were playing. The next they were lights out. Gone. Hit the floor, bye bye, dead. 

But the last group of poor souls got it bad. Something about the message triggered them into a murderous rage. Thousand upon thousands of children worldwide went on a murder spree. 

They killed their families without remorse, taking the time to arrange their dead bodies like Christmas stars. No matter how they died or where in the world the grievous act was committed, parents, siblings, grandma and grandad's were placed around the tree, arms and legs spread to the world. 

Our factory descended into madness. Only one among us could have done it. Only an elf could produce such a devastating doll. While the world tried to understand what had happened, Santa tried to find the culprit. But he didn't.  

That St Stevens night the elf's had a hard time retrieving all the dolls. But, contrary to what you may think, only a handful of dolls were taken as evidence and only one was missing completely. Where that doll went is anyone's guess. 

Well, not everyone. I have the last doll. A token if you will. A message for you humans and a calling to my elven family. 

I thought I was quite a genius coming up with it. With a little sprinkle of magic to aid the effects. 

θα βάψεις τα σπίτια σου κόκκινα, άκου το κάλεσμά μου. κάνε ένα δώρο στον Άγιο Βασίλη, σκότωσε τους όλους.

rakxqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rakxqs/better/,Better,413,20,1638833511.0,"What would you do if you could wish for anything?

The wishes came from a half used matchbook in an abandoned mall. ""Strike the match and speak your wish aloud"" was printed on its outside in ornate gold script. Amused, I did so.

""I wish I had a cigarette.""

It was in my other hand as soon as I finished speaking and I dropped the match on the floor out of fright. My second wish was for ten thousand dollars. I cursed myself as soon as I'd said it, I could have asked for millions, billions even. 

One match left. I took a drag from the cigarette and cleared my mind. The answer was suddenly obvious.

""I wish Molly was better.""

If you'd known her you'd have done the same. She was smart and funny too, albeit with a dark sense of humour. She was also dying.

I came home and found all the cash stowed behind the broken wardrobe panel with other things I hid away. Molly told us about her mysterious recovery to us two weeks later and for a short stint of our lives, life was good.

Molly had never been a good student but a week after her health returned, her grades shot up. She beat half the track team in gym class. More annoyingly to us, she became more *moral*. Molly was probably technically becoming more of a good person but none of us were good people back then. Maybe we'd have grown out of it, maybe we were just a product of our shithole of a town.

I was barely 17 when the misfortunes started happening. They weren't all deaths at first and you'd have had to have really known Molly to know they were linked to her. The jock who tried to grope her broke his leg, the stoner she hated got sick, the teacher who refused to be her academic reference died of a heart attack.

The real tragedy struck three years later. My whole town was scrubbed off the map in under an hour. I drove home at breakneck pace even though the news said survivors were 'unlikely.'

I searched through the destruction, trying to find the rubble that had once been my parents' house. Then I saw Molly, wandering through it all without a care in the world.

""This was you."" I said, unsure of how I knew but certain nonetheless.

""Yes. This place was broken. It needed to go."" Molly said.

""My friends... family... god Molly, even your family. Am I next, is that it?""

She shook her head softly.

""I'm not sure I can. Simon told me what you did, the wish you made about me. Ending you might reverse it. Tell me though, what did you wish exactly?""

""I just wished you'd get better."" I said through clenched teeth.

Molly chuckled.

""Well, I am that. Better than I was. Better than you.""

Her feet left the ground and she rose effortlessly.

""Better than human."""

Then my wife woke me in the middle of the night, her voice frantic as she whispered, “Do you hear that?”

Then came the smell.

A musk, with undertones of rot. At first, we thought we had mold, but there were no signs of leaks. Just the occasional wet trail in the bathroom, but never enough to cause concern.

It wasn’t until the sinkhole that we realized what we’d been living on.

The hole swallowed our entire living room. As we looked down into the gaping crater where we used to watch TV, we saw them.

Ryan hadn’t quite realised his deep horror of sunflowers until the damn things became trendy on Instagram and Kelly started insisting that they visit a local sunflower farm for selfies. 

After all, it is quite easy to go through life avoiding sunflowers. Ryan had childhood memories of them, wilting and musty at his mother’s funeral. Later he remembered a batch growing wild on a patch of earth close to school. They were so tall, their brown speckled heads nodding in the blinding sunlight, birds flapping around them and those ugly yellow petals. 

Ryan hated them, hated walking by them and was relieved when they moved to a sunflower-free place. Then, he was able to forget the plant monsters, and even his nightmares of them, brown and yellow, flapping and nodding, faded. 

Until now. Kelly was obsessed with social media. Ryan didn’t mind and even started enjoying it, arranging his sushi on the plate just so before eating, stopping every so often for those all-important couple selfies, and joining her in reading comments and comparing the number of likes on different photos.

But this was different. He didn’t even know at first why he kept finding excuses not to visit the sunflower farm, until one day in early fall, Kelly said she’d planned it, they were going this Saturday as it would be the last weekend of the season that the farm was open to the public. She said it in a tone that brooked no disagreement, and instantly Ryan’s childhood horror awakened, as intensely sharp as when he had to walk by them twice a day, trying to avoid the sight of their beastly speckled seed-filled heads and flapping large petals. 

Saturday morning arrived too soon. Kelly looked stunning in a bright blue dress, and she fussed with Ryan’s matching lighter blue casual-looking t-shirt. “Blue will pop against the background, see sweetie?” and she showed her screen displaying millions of pictures of grinning fools against the malign creatures. 

Ryan shuddered and turned away. As they drove closer to the farm, his misery grew deeper, the blobs of browny-yellow against the dark green shone brighter and their haunting terrible smell hung in the crisp fall air. 

The crowd was unbelievable- clearly they were not the only ones hoping to catch the last sunflower pics of the season. The happy farmer took their cash and ushered them towards the field. Ryan felt he was suffocating. Kelly’s voice came from a distance- “here? What do you think sweetheart?”

The laughing chattering crowd seemed to pull him away from her and deeper into the mass of sunflowers. He glimpsed Kelly, arranging her sunhat and skirt. Then she vanished from sight. The crowd melted. Ryan was alone, surrounded by the sunflowers, their seeded dark heads towering over him, leaning down closer. 

Their petals brushed against his skin. 

He sank to the earth screaming hysterically, the plants bent over him, covering him with green leaves and yellow petals and he knew nothing more."

I use to enjoy secretly going up to people who are dead, but are fully enjoying themselves being dead, and I would bring them back into the world where they will have to work again, pay bills and experience other uncomfortable feelings. I saw a dead person on the ground and he was smiling and the knife stabbed into his chest was what was keeping him dead. He looked so peaceful like he had finally found peace and that nothing could bother him. 

I snuck up on the dead body but the dead body rose on its feet. The body had an automatic mechanism which will stand up and fight anyone who tried to pull the knife out of him. I fought the body and pulled the knife out and the man was now back in life. He begged me to stab him again and I sadistically said ""no"" and he cried some more. I threw away the knife and I told him while laughing ""now that I have forced you back into the world you now have to work, pay bills, meet people you don't want to meet and do things you don't want to do"" and I walked away. 

The reason I enjoyed doing this was because somebody else did it to me. I was happily dead but some punk pulled out the axe from my head. After doing this hobby for a while somebody had spotted me and asked me if I could do it to a dead person they knew, but for money. It was illegal to force happily dead people back into life. From then on I only started forcibly bringing back happy dead people from the living people that paid me. Like I said it's not as simple as pulling out the knife or bullet because at first you would have to fight the body which has an automatic response to fight back. 

On my last job I was paid to pull out a sword from a happy dead guy. The person who paid me was jealous that this guy got to escape the rat race and had evil intentions towards the happy dead guy. It's a selfish game. As I went towards the dead body to pull out the sword, the body like a robot jumped up to its feet and formed wings. It tried to fly away but I held it down and pulled out the sword, and the dead guy was back in life. 

He cried and cried to be stabbed back but I didn't do it. I miss doing it all for fun to happy dead people that I wanted to do it to. Now I have to listen to the people paying me, I have to do it on their time table and I miss doing it for fun instead of responsibility. Too late now."

Trade with the neighbouring villages was difficult, almost impossible during the long, cold winters. If the crops were bad, then the people would starve. 

Centuries before, out of desperation and neccessity, they had forged the deal. The May Snow would come, but it required an offering.

Since the early age of the village, the Giving-Tree stood tall in the square. Grotesque giant limbs sticking out at unatural angles, sending thin spidery like branches in every possible direction. The leafs, like the rest of the tree, were of pure white.

When the first of May hit, the whole town put itself to work. They all had to do their part. The farmers ploughed the fields and set the seeds, the others dug the small hole at the base of the Tree.

Two weeks later when the fields were ready, they gathered in the silent darkness at the Giving-Tree. It was always the first born of the year, there was no discrimination on status. The blood pouring from its cuts was carefully collected. Once the small innocent body was buried, the blood was poured in a circle around the base. No words needed be spoken. Beginning at the roots, they could see the red making its way up the dead white of it. It was time to go home before it came.

Once the animals where shut in and everyone in the town was safely back at home, they prayed. They did their best to shut out the baleful crying emanating from the Giving-Tree, echoing loud and terrible across the village. 

And so the May Snow began to fall. It silently powdered the roofs and emtpy streets in the black of night. Most importantly it fell thickly upon the fields, fertilizing that years seeds with its nourishing content. This year the crops would be good. They had done what they must.

The May Snow would now fall relentlessly for three days. Always the same deep crimson red color."

She rode that sympathetic tide, her quietly buoyant spirit unmarred by the half-dozen faint scars that crossed her wrists. Whenever she’d tuck her hair behind her ear, I couldn’t help but flinch at those scarcely keloid deceptions. Scars worn like costume jewelry. 

Maria was a con-artist, a fucking fraud, and I knew her little white lies long before the malignancy of the ruse blackened my heart to the snake oil on her cheeks.

She had a pretty way, and there was a time when that made me love her. And I did love her. I did. But I buried the care that fed that love whenever a bath went too long. The threat became a taxing preoccupation. And when she cried, my rescuer’s run became slower and slower. Eventually, I started stepping backwards. 

Maria was a con-artist. A masterful one. 

But the lie was the smile. 

‘Calloused becomes the heart that ever bleeds for another,’ she had written in the note. She knew what I felt and as I wrapped myself in distance, she just kept smiling—pretending to be the person I had met before a blue existence turned the bath water red. 

The note was written in an even hand, crisp white paper creased and folded and left beneath a soap dish. It concluded, ‘the act became the act.  One killed, the other laid to rest.’

As I set it down, the paper’s edge bit into my skin. A sting. A languid welling of blood. I sucked the wound and forgave her for leaving. *I* forgave *her*.

A bill cut me next, not a day later. Then a menu, a receipt, a windswept flyer. Each drew blood. It washed away, but the open wounds remained. The pain nagged as my hands fell idle, as I began to dread the rustle of the letterbox and packaging for frozen pizza. 

It was a week before I noticed the swelling redness of infection. A fever followed and a nurse at the clinic rolled her eyes. 

“It’s a paper cut—I think you’ll live. Take two of these and remember to wash your hands *thoroughly.*”

I smiled, trying not to wince. “Thanks.”

The fever fell, but in time, it returned. The pain grew and my friends looked on with concern, then pity, then indifference. 

“I keep getting paper cuts...”

What tears do we shed for a wound so trivial? What effort do we offer when a cry for help can be muted with a bandage?

So I screamed beneath a smiling mask—my threadbare offering to those few people who stayed for the unbearable lie. But I was never truly alone. 

I had Maria. 

As I suffered, her memory remained. I understood her. I had become her pain. 

And I kept her note. It was a reminder of the first cut, but it was also a reminder of her. Sweet words folded into a crisp blade."

Before I could fully get my senses straight, a hand covered my mouth and told me to be silent. My eyes darted to my friend Rhian, whose slumber seemed eternal. 

I wasn't sure if it was my fear that made the room so deadly quite or that the noises feared him. 

All the fight that I knew I could muster just went non-existent, like I was under a spell, like a marionette whose strings weren't being pulled. 

The way my heart raced felt like a bomb was about to go off my chest which only ticked faster when a blindfold was tied on my head as he placed me in the backseat of a car. 

I could've screamed bloody murder by then but I was such in a state of disbelief that my mind still couldn't process what was happening. 

The drive felt like a lifetime, every turn convinced me that I would soon meet death and when he finally stopped and took me out of the vehicle, the sight that greeted me when he took the cover off almost made me lose my mind. 

There I was at the early hours of the morning standing in front of my home as the sound of a car driving off faded slowly in the background. 

The strong brush of the wind couldn't rival the way I screamed at that. 

A scream that turned into a screech that woke my parents and neighbors up. A sound that showed how horror was wrecking my body as it trembled and made tears fall as my mom wore panic and worry, trying to calm me down while dad called 9-1-1.

It took the morning light before the authorities could get a word out of me. 

Questions were asked over and over but what I couldn't answer was the one about what he looked like.

I wasn't sure if it was because I was too scared at that moment because all I remember seeing was that he had no face. Maybe he had one and I just couldn't accept that it was the face of a person that would bring my demise.

The investigation also revealed that there had been no sign of a break-in at Rhian's house and it couldn't be her father coz he had already been dead for five years. Different angles had been taken and not one yielded any result.

The case's trail went cold as it had been fifteen years and he...it...still hasn't been caught. Fifteen years of therapy, of checking the bolts on every door of the house three times a day, and fifteen years of this waking nightmare.

“Yessir. A glow. I was intrigued, so I went towards it. I followed it. I went past the field, into the forest. The glow was farther away than I thought. A lot farther. I must’ve walked for thirty minutes.”  
“The crime scene was four miles away from your residence.”  
“See? But, I digress, I get to the glow, and it’s from a fire. Surrounding the fire are these tents. And out from the tents come these… people.”  
“Describe them.”  
“That would be hard.”

“What gender?”  
“I can’t tell you. I couldn’t make enough out. They all got down on their knees and they started to chant. Out from the dark of the forest, the side opposite me, there came another figure, leading those children towards that fire. They were all tied up. They all stood up, in turn, in front of those people. And then… they were pushed into the fire. And the people kneeled down by the fire, and they chanted louder and louder. I turned away, it was too horrible, and when I looked back, it was gone. Those bodies were lying at my feet. Another man came out from the trees and saw me and just started screaming.”  
McLowen shook his head. 

“Listen, son. I don’t know what you’re on but that isn’t going to go past me or a judge and certainly not a jury.”  
“But…”  
“No. This isn’t a game. This isn’t a horror movie. This isn’t a short scary story. You tell me of a… a… coven of witches. I didn’t do it, they did.”  
“But it’s true.”  
“Son, it’s best if you just stop talking.”  
He leaned back in his chair. He took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it up. I watched the ember burn and glow, just like the fire in the forest."

Other than the occasional painful step on a lego I got to his room pretty fast and saw him standing up in his crib.

He was way more upset than I had ever seen him before, he looked scared. Terrified even.

There had been storms before and he had never reacted like this before.

Then I saw him... During the brief moment a lightningstrike lit up the room I saw the outline of a man hiding behind the drapes.

My heart immediately started beating faster... Will he attack me? Does he know I've spotted him?

No, if he knew he would have attacked me already. I picked Ayden up as calmly as I could and started talking to him as I would normally.

*Aww, did the lightning scare you little guy? Come on, you can sleep with me and mommy tonight.*

I started walking out the door back to the master bedroom and that's when I heard the drapes being pulled to the side and he spoke with a raspy voice...

*Did you see me? Well, it doesn't matter now...*

I heard him dashing toward me and I ran to my wife only to see another strange man standing over the bed where my now dead and bloody wife lies..."
r9tife,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r9tife/the_message/,The Message,314,17,1638749672.0,"Three years ago, the remains of Professor Warren Thomas Andrews, an astrophysicist, were found still burning in the forest by his home. An autopsy confirmed he had done this to himself. A well liked and easy going professor, he gave no indication of suicide ideation before he killed himself and everyone was taken aback when the news spread of the brutality of his death. He had set himself on fire after dousing himself in petrol, but also slashed his wrists. 

It was almost as though he had to make extra sure he wasn’t going to survive even if he changed his mind. 

The strangest thing of all was that he didn’t leave a note, not even to his wife who, by all accounts, was the love of his life.

For years, the story of his suicide was a town mystery. An urban legend passed down between the students at the university. Everyone had a theory. Some said he had found out his wife was having an affair. Some said one day he just snapped. Someone even suggested that the professor was hiding a dark secret. 

And those people were perhaps closer to the truth than they realise. 

You see, three years after his death, Professor Warren Thomas Andrews’ final note was published in the main town newspaper anonymously yesterday. 

Its contents are the reason there is currently a spate of suicides, crime and chaos erupting across the country.

“For years, I have thought that the placement of the stars is not random, that it is a message. I mentioned it once, and my peers laughed at me, so secretly I began to decipher the message I thought was there.

Yesterday, two decades of research later I have learned I am right. There is a message in our night sky every night. It has been the same for all eternity. I wish I had never tried to learn what it said.

Forgive me. I cannot keep living with the knowledge of what I have found and what I know it will unleash into the world.

I am leaving you with a translation of the exact words.

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where a man is hanging because he murdered three; Strange things happen here, you will see, but stranger still is he murdered me.* 

The kids sang that rhyme. When I walked to the tree or the gallows. An enigma in a mask. A phantom who came and took. Time had blurred the memory of the count. One hundred. Two. Five. A thousand. Only those who harvest the souls truly know. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where the dead man gurgles out to be free; they say he hangs because he killed three, so stay your hand or it will be thee.*

I see them hanging everywhere now. In the branches of the forest. From every lamp post down the street. Swinging in the breeze. Gazes fixed in accusing stares. The heavy weight loads my shoulders. But the conviction isn't mine. I am the bullet to the ones who pulled the trigger. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Wear your necklace of hope, side by side with me; They say he murdered more than three, and at the drop we will be free.*

I walk now to the trees. A noose swings gently from a strong branch. The last leaf falls. The amber ground crunches under my boot. The man's throat bobs with guilt. The tree is tall. The rope is thick. Another soul will die out tonight. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where the strung up a man, they say murdered three. Rumour says it was he, who hung the man who murdered three.*

The song knows the truth. Those that had false accusations against them. Those that hung under my hands for crimes they didn't commit. But they see me. They know. They are there, hanging in the breeze. Eyes popped open. Lips purple with the kiss of truth. They know. And so do I. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where they hang the man who murdered thee. Strange things happen, you will see, as he hangs and cries and begs and pleads.*

The noose fits perfectly around my throat. Four inches thick. One for every hundred I've killed. Sure, I didn't condemn them but I pulled the switch, hoisted the rope. I see them hanging. The ones I've murdered. I see them everywhere. There's no escaping them. But I will follow. 

For I will go down to the hanging tree. Where strange things happen, I have seen; I'll string up the man who murdered thee, and then, just than, we might be free."

""Fill them with love""

Those were my mother's last words to me. This woman who neglected me my whole life spoke those words as if they were her only regret. The phrase left her lips as her eyes studied my kids through the window of her room, each of them having a conversation while waiting in the hospice hallway. Then she passed away of the very preventable disease. I blamed myself, of course. When I broke the news to my children, their tears broke my heart. It was then that I decided to honor her words in everyway that I could. 

""Can I have 5$ for the book fair, mom?"" My youngest boy asked sweetly. 

I told him yes and slipped the extra 25$ in his bulging lunch sack. Each of their meals entailed an apple, a orange, 3 cheese sticks, a jello, a pudding, 4 juice boxes, and 2 stuffed ham sandwiches. On top of the large buffet sat notes that read the motto I'd adopted. 
""Filled with love"" 

When my twin daughter's birthdays came around it was the same thing. There was 5 cakes, each with 4 tiers. In total they were allowed to invite 50 friends, 70 came and we were the talk of the town for awhile. 5th graders don't often have parties with an entire bounce house mansion. The debt was worth it. Many of our guest got ill from eating too much ice cream. I told all of the parents the same thing. 
""They're filled with love""

Shortly after that my babies wanted a dog. You should have seen their faces when I came home with the whole pound. We didn't feel the need to cage any of them. They were family after all. A few of the animals weren't the best house guests but I was always sure to fill them with love. 

When flu season came, as it always does, two out of three caught a bug and the other soon followed. None of them were able to attend school while the house was filled with the sounds of coughing. I knew just what to do. The woman at the drug store gave me a strange look but I figured she never heard my mother's last words. After a few boxes of pills and bottles of syrup, they each took a very restful nap while my entire house filled with love."

The local dance studio allows me to attend their dance lessons out of charity because it was well publicized that my mom died in a car accident last year.

We are performing the Nutcracker Ballet this afternoon and I am really hoping that my dad shows up.

As the performance starts, I can’t see out in the audience because of all the bright lights in my face.

After the performance was over all the family members met with their kids outside in the hallway of the theater, where all of the kid performers were getting hugs and flowers.

As I got to the end of the hallway, I realized that my father didn’t show up.

I couldn’t stop crying which made me feel more embarrassed.

As all of the family members were driving away from the theater, I got on my bike and pedaled away, where all of the cars were looking at me as I rode by.

Things got even worse when I got to my housing development, where the eighth grade girls from school were huddled together in the street.  They started calling me the worst names because I still had my Nutcracker outfit on.

They make fun of me every day but today made me feel even worse, because I felt so alone after nobody came to my recital.

I walked past my father’s bedroom, where I figured that he was still sleeping from being drunk from the night before.

I cried in my room in the dark with my recital outfit still on for a long time.

After a while, my dad came into my room and said “I’m so so sorry for missing your recital. Please come out to the living room for a minute.”

I walk to the living room and we both look out the window.

My dad then says “I want you to take a look at that girl who is riding that bike down the street.”

I see that she has cut up jeans on, like most eighth grade girls do, but there is something really different about her, where I’m not sure if she’s 13 or 30.  She kind of looks like a Gremlin or something.

As she gets close to the girls who harass me each and every day, she gets off her bike, then throws the bike to the ground, where the closest girl to her is Kimberly, who treats me the worst.

The Gremlin looking girl walks up to Kimberly and grabs her by the hair and repeatedly punches her in the face, where there’s so much blood pouring out of Kimberly’s nose.

As Kimberly is hysterically crying on the ground, she methodically hunts down each of the other girls and beats them to a pulp, then the Gremlin looking girl gets on her bike and waves to me as she rides away.

I’m both stunned and elated, where my dad then says “That girl knew your mother!”

I said “thanks dad” as I hugged him."

Splinters of wood went hurtling through the air as Giuseppe continued to rain blows down on Pinocchio’s wooden frame.  “Do you want to know why you’ll never be a real boy? You’re an abomination.”

Years of neglect and abuse left Pinocchio’s wooden body battered and broken. The sound of woodlice borrowing into his wooden head kept him awake at night. He would stare at the burn marks leftover from Giuseppe’s drunken, belligerent cruelty and wondered if the heat from the fire felt as nice as its glow.

Giuseppe only left Pinocchio out of the house once a week to do errands. He hated going out, even more so than the cruel torment he received at home.  The cruelty of strangers was worse than what he got at home. As he walked nervously down the road towards the shop, people glared at home before shouting cruel taunts at him. He passed kids playing a game he had never seen before and got lost looking at the joy it brought them. The kids saw him watching, and joy turned to anger as they began chasing him down the street. His fragile legs buckled from under him, and he went tumbling to the ground. Just as the kids descended on him, a dishevelled looking woman jumped to his rescue.

The woman embraced him and picked him off the floor. The woman had a look on her face he had never seen before. He didn’t know what a smile was, but it looked nice, like the glow of a raging fire. People looked on in horror as she carried the poor wooden boy down the street to his house. Before she could get the boy home, a crowd gathered.  “I told you she’s a witch,” shouted one person as the momentum of hatred began to grow.  “Burn the Witch,” roared through the crowd as they marched her to the centre of the village. Pinocchio looked on in horror as the kind woman begged for her life.

Watching the only person to show him kindness being dragged to her death was too much to bear. “I’m cursed with no soul, burn me.” The crowd turned to face Pinocchio. Chants of burn them both echoed through the air as they mounted him to the same stake the woman was tied to.

Being made of wood, he wasn’t going to feel anything. He looked at the woman who was smiling down on him and felt sad for her. As the flames licked at his wooden feet he suddenly felt himself changing. The selfless act of trying to take the woman's place in death was enough to break the curse and turn Pinocchio into a real boy.

The crowd watched on in silent shame as the torturous and horrific scream’s from the poor boy could be heard throughout the village."

He has had it for quite some time, he got it after my mom passed away. She died in her sleep, from mysterious causes. Or at least what the police report says.
 
My father hasn’t allowed me into the farm or the shed or anywhere. I have never seen animals, he said that he hid them in the back because he doesn’t want them attacking me but I always thought that was a blatant lie. always, at night. When I pretend to be asleep, my father cuts and kills the animals. Every night I hear an ear-screeching high pitch scream. I told my father this, that it kept waking me up every night and he said that rabbits and other animals - when they die, they let out a last scream. Letting out all of the breath from their lungs before their eventual death. I had always thought that the scream of rabbits sounded like a small child screaming at the top of their lungs but I believed my father about the rabbits.
 
Of course, I listened to my father and kept on with my life. Doing what I was doing, hearing that same high-pitched scream every night before an eventual slice and their head thumping to the ground - where I would eat their cooked dead body laying on a platter on the dinner table.
 
One day. To be specific, October 30th. It was a rainy and gloomy day and my father wasn’t at the house or the farm. He was in town, getting groceries and more tools for the farm. They were worn out. On this day, I was curious. Curious about what animals were being kept on the farm, but my mother has always said “curiosity killed the cat” but I never believed that I always never listened.
 
I walked out to the farm from the house, wearing a yellow rain slicker and green rain boots that went up halfway to my knee. I walked through the thick mud that was past the deck, which led into a pathway that went down to the large wooden building where the animals were kept and the large metal shed where all of the pitched screams came, in the night.
 
I eventually reached a large metal door that went into the wooden building. I grabbed the doorknob and twisted it - the door creaked open with a broad sound, the rusty door hinges swung by a gust of wind. I walked into the wooden farm and looked around, I did not see any animals. Nothing. No cows, rabbits, chickens, anything.
 
I glanced over to the left side of the wall on the barn. At this moment I thought. I thought about what my mother had always said “curiosity killed the cat” but I realized that she wasn’t trying to teach me a life lesson. She was trying to warm me. The high-pitched screams weren’t from animals.
 
Carved into the wall on the barn were the words “HELP” with a splatter of blood covering the wall, next to it. I stared in horror, but as I walked away - fear struck. My father’s car rolled into the large stone-filled driveway."

That means *not of sound mind*, non compos mentis. Fancy talk for *unhinged fucking psycho*, which is what they really mean.

They’ll have you believe I planned it all, that when my husband and I drove into that tunnel, I drugged him, or knocked him unconscious. They’ll have you believe I somehow pulled him out, and then…well, I guess you’ve read the reports.

And I won’t deny having had second thoughts. I won’t. But to do that? No way, Jorge. Not a chance, Vance. That’s just not me.

The truth is that the moment we entered that tunnel, we went elsewhere. Not just some*where* else. Some*time* else? Out of this world. Or deeper within it?  We went to *his* place. His *realm*.

*Welcome to my Realm, Shae*, he said.

*Who the fuck are you?* I asked.

*I’m the Unmaker.*

*That doesn’t sound very good*, I suggested.

The tunnel wasn’t a tunnel any more. It was rocky, sure, cavernous, but there was an…*ambience* to the place, like how you get a feeling that you’re somewhere…really *fucked up*. Felt like a violation; a forced rupture in something sacred. An oozing flesh wound in reality, dripping with pus and rot.

He’d set a lovely table though. Flickering candlelight, two plates, glasses, a bottle of red wine. A large platter, covered with one of those metal domes, whatdoyoucallit.

Cloche? So posh. Let’s just call it a dome, Jerome.

*Sit down with me, Shae*, the Unmaker said. *Sit down and feast.*

He didn’t look like anyone I knew. No eyes on that leathery-flesh-pink-hued face, just a big old flapping mouth, filled with teeth which would put a great white shark to shame. He wore a cloth cut from the Universe itself I’d say, like a void cape, but he didn’t make a big deal out of it or anything. Perfect gentleman.

He lifted the dome. *Feast,* he said.

So I did. I sat down, and I stuffed my fucking face, meat-juices and blood and slimy weird parts flying everywhere. Didn’t even touch the cutlery.

I didn’t recognize him. How could I? Deep down though, I knew.

*Your wish has been granted*, the Unmaker proclaimed. *He has been Unmade*.

But I didn’t wish for that.

Did I?

They’ll have you believe I did.

They’ll have you believe my husband, who swore, on a bible no less, that *Yes, Your Honor, she did it*.

I woke up to his screams. So bestial, like a dying animal. Raw, guttural, meaningful. It took me a while to understand what he was trying to convey.

*Jesus-fucking-Christ, Shae. What have you done?!*

I just sat there, lost in thought, trying to get a particularly stringy piece of meat out of my teeth, not quite fathoming why I felt so…*different*.

*Ah*, I said, bloody-meat-juicy hands resting on my stomach. *That’s probably it.*

I'm rooting for all the bad guys to succeed and when you don't succeed and the good guy wins, it is a horrible day for me. The one bad guy I always root for is Brian, and Brian is a man who loves spoiling people. When he use to spoil kids in the care home with sweets and other goodies, even though it wasn't allowed, it's when he stops spoiling them is when the fun starts. When Brian suddenly stopped giving sweets to kids in the care home, they couldn't believe it. They all started shaking and shivering and then their body shape started changing in an insane fast pace. It was great to look at. 

From that day on I rooted for Brian to succeed and when he then got a job in a residential building as a concierge, the residents always forgot their fob cards but Brian always use to let them into the building and elevators. He started spoiling the residents by constantly giving them free fob cards and spare keys and the residents became spoiled, and always relied on the concierge to always let them into the apartment. Then when Brian suddenly stopped doing it for them, the residents started to get stomach cramps. Their insides started to move and shake and strange circular things started to come out of them and what came out of them looked like an alien. Their anger and frustrated at not being spoiled by the concierge anymore caused them great pain and the things going out of them was screaming and the strange oddities started killing other oddities which came out of other residents. 

This is why I root for Brian and all the other bad guys and even when it unknowing happened to me, I was still rooting for the bad guy. I got so spoiled at witnessing Brian spoiling people in general and then taking it away from them, and watching the victim suffer in such strange and odd ways. Some people started growing more heads and arms when they stopped being spoiled. Then when Brian suddenly stopped spoiling people and then taking it away, I started to have some unusual reactions. My skin started inverting and my organs started inverting and everything else looked like some 5th dimensional trip. It's getting better now and I am still rooting for the bad guys like Brian."

Once the screams reach their peak, they vanish without a trace, the thing coming out the other side still in a ball, but it's skin hard as diamonds. As if you'd be hurting yourself if you punch it. And finally, the third machine. Once it goes inside, nothing will be heard. Literally. A vacuum of sound that swallows up every noise that is being made.

Winnona was by far the most beautiful woman Tom had ever dated, and he felt surprise almost every day that she had ever agreed to go out with him, a six or maybe seven on a good day. 

Not only was her face gorgeous, reminiscent of Cindy Crawford with her tawny hair, hazel -almost golden eyes- and wide generous mouth, her figure was perfect. Big boobs, small waist, a firm round ass and delicate beautifully molded arms and thighs. 

They began sleeping together after their second or third date. 

And try as he might, Tom found it impossible not to notice that her boobs were quite hairy. 

What made it so odd was that everywhere else which should be hairless, was quite immaculate. She definitely wasn’t some annoying feminist “body-hair positive” warrior.  There was no hint of a ‘stache,  her legs, her armpits, her pussy and bum crack were all smooth. But a fine layer of fuzz covered her boobs, spreading out below on her torso, fading just at the top, where her bra stopped. Her perfect pink nipples poked out of the fuzz, as desirable and delicious as any a pair. 

Winnona’s hairy boobs were not exactly a turn off- but they were definitely different. And he certainly didn’t like how individual strands came off in his mouth when he sucked them.

How could she not know? After all the effort he had put into dating her, there was no way he could tell her- plus the actual sex was amazing- fiery intense, like nothing else he had ever experienced. He couldn’t risk that. But the paradox remained- how could this woman, clearly conscious of her appearance and very skilled in the fine art of sex with men, not know her boobs were hairy? Not mention it, even jokingly? 

It must have been a month into their relationship when Winona said they couldn’t have sex that night – “it’s that time of the month baby”. 

“Noooo!” protested Tom. “I want you in my bed, I don’t care! Come over sweetheart, we’ll cuddle up all night!”

Winnona took some convincing “I get moody and restless” she warned him, but Tom by now had become so addicted to her presence in his bed that he didn’t care. “Please come baby, I want to be with you!”

Once in bed and cuddled up, Tom couldn’t stop himself, laying his head on her chest and letting his fingers roam in the fuzz of her boobs, pulling and tweaking her nipples endlessly. Winnona moaned “Stop it baby- I can’t- ohhhhh”

\-“Let me pleasure you” he whispered.

\-No you don’t underst… ahhhh” 

Winnona’s sentence trailed off into a howl as Tom felt her body shake and transform under his hands. He cried out in amazed horror as the fuzz spread and grew, her face elongated, a thick bushy tail sprouted. 

Within seconds, Tom found himself in bed with a beautiful aroused vixen, playfully nipping his body, brushing her thick tail along his shocked flaccid penis."

Loansharks and debtors had been knocking on my door every night, screaming curses and spraying ‘O$P$’ on the door. Rent was due. Utilities were due. I lost my job because of the pandemic. I found a new one though, one where I had to work the whole night with little pay. There were even times when I went hungry.

I was really desperate for a better job, so I scoured the Internet for one. Yes, even the Dark Web. The sites not for kids.

Then I found the website.

It was full of bright colours and devil cartoon characters in various poses. It promised big money and even fame.

All I needed to do was to sell my soul.

I was desperate. I clicked on the link, and filled up the form.

Thirty seconds later, there was a ping from my phone. The money had come in. One million dollars as a welcome gift. ‘And more to come!’ promised the tagline at the end.

My jaw dropped. A million dollars was a lot of money. At that exact moment, I knew all my problems were solved in an instant.

For every month after that, a million dollars were sent to my bank account. The loansharks were paid. The utilities were paid. I could afford to buy better food now--lobster and crab. I even bought a mansion on a private island.

Parties were held at my mansion every night, the bar stacked with the finest wines. It was at one of those parties when I saw the man in the skull mask. He was wearing a black cloak and was holding a scythe in his right hand.

My heart froze into ice, and the website, which I had long forgotten, came rushing back to me. Bodies moved to wild music and booming bass like a tidal wave, but the man sliced through them like they weren’t even there.

“Your time has come,” he said.

I nodded numbly. There was nothing more I could do.

He swung his scythe, and I felt my body burst open, blood exploding everywhere. The man rummaged around my insides, tossing out maroon kidneys, stomach, and heart, before closing his hand over a little squirming white orb.

He put the orb inside his cloak and stitched me up the best he could. “Have a good day,” he said formally.

After he left, the world darkened to a solid gray. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to enjoy myself. Even living in a mansion was not so fun anymore.

In the end, I sold everything and moved back to a single apartment. I even fell into old habits, drinking and drugs, and even that was truly tasteless.

I was downing a bottle of whisky, feeling nothing, when the man in the skull mask came back. This time he was morbidly cheerful, grinning behind his skull mask.

r9aucm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r9aucm/what_is_happiness/,"""What Is Happiness?""",57,9,1638691190.0,"Do you know what happiness is? Do you really think so? Well, I do. I know exactly what it is.

Happiness is when you are warm and fed. When you feel the familiar smell. The smell of home.

I've been vagabonding since I was a teenager. I have never been excelling at the school and never achieved anything significant, unlike plenty of my peers. So at a very young age, I decided to travel instead of studying.

I've been to many states and many countries. I've met many people: rich and poor, honest and corrupted, beautiful and ugly. And even though my life has never been easy and I had to struggle through lots of misfortunes, I've never regretted my decision. 

Until the moment when I remembered my mother's face when she heard I was going to leave.

My poor mother, God bless her kind soul. Her cry was so heartbreaking. My father died before I was born. My younger sister was killed in the accident at the farm, so I was my mother's only family and her only company.

I left her without looking back and saying goodbye. I ran down the road until I stopped hearing her cries. I needed to stay far away from everyone to find myself. Even away from her.

But now, after so many years, I want to get back, to feel her warmth. To hear her voice. To sleep beside her. I need the love I couldn't find anywhere around the globe - the love that only a mother can give to her child.

...

I got off the train, took a deep breath, and looked around. It's hard to believe she still lives here. But I'm so happy to see the place where I grew up.

The train station hasn't changed a bit. Even the taxicab looks familiar - I wouldn't be surprised if this same car had taken me to the station many years ago. And these houses and gardens on the way to my house... I feel like I'm fourteen again.

This is my village. Oh, seriously? They never repaired that barn?... What a shame! Well, this is my street. A couple of more miles...
 
I'm here. My house.

The roses in the garden are blooming. What a beautiful season to come back. Who's that, trimming the bushes under the window? Mom?..

""Good afternoon, mother.""

She turns around. Her eyes immediately get wet. She's much older now, but she looks at me with the same love. Mom, I missed you. I missed you so much.

She hugs me, and together we walk into the house.

""Welcome back home, son. I'll show you your room,"" she says.

I pull out the knife and stab her. Again and again. I rip out her internals, her guts. I'm emptying her body through her screams. I'm making the room.

Finally, I find her womb and squeeze my head in. It's warm, just like when I was little. When I was happy.

So what is happiness to **you**?"

I could feel my palms sweating against her cool and calm hand as we walked. I’d never held hands with a girl before, let alone kiss one. My drunken friends now far behind us cooed and whooped drunkenly after us. 

“Mainly just spring break.” I admitted “We don’t know much about Lake Menatita other than the party spots. No cops, apparently!”

“Police do come by occasionally. But only for *really* bad stuff.” 

“What sort of *really* bad stuff?” I jeered. 

Johanna paused, biting her lip as if she were hiding some sort of secret. 

“Locals don’t like people talking about it…. But people go missing here. Like, a *lot*.” 

“Like, serial killers?”  

“No. They just go missing. No trace whatsoever. People think Lake Menatita possesses people to drown themselves.” 

Part of me wanted to know more, but part of me also didn’t want to turn the topic of conversation. When a gorgeous girl wants to take a walk along the lake with you, the last thing she wants to think of is brutal drownings. 

“Well, *that* wasn’t in the brochure!” 

“The locals don’t want people knowing. It drives off the spring break kids, which also means there are *never* any good guys here!”  

There it was. My move I’d been waiting for since Johanna said hello to our group. I waited until we were safely behind a sandbank, from my friends’ prying eyes. I slid one arm to her waist, pulling her close. I looked to her beautiful, sparkling eyes. 

“So, do I make the cut?” I asked, gently. I had no clue what I was doing. But whatever it was, it seemed to work. 

“Oh, I don’t know about that!” She pulled me closer “But I want to find out..”

Clothes quickly abandoned; I didn’t have the nerves to tell Johanna I was a virgin. But the moment she ran from the bank, her glorious naked body had my teenage mind whirling and I was following her as quickly as I could pull my pants down. 

We swam out to the middle of the lake, ensuring by now we wouldn’t be seen by my friends packing up and heading back to the cabin. 

“The water looks so black at night.” I looked to the water as we bobbed together, her body pinned to mine. 

*“It’s worse at the bottom.”*

As I looked back up at her, I saw Johanna’s sparkling eyes were gone and replaced with two black shiny sockets. Her smile was gone, replaced by jaws of pitch black with grey stone sharp teeth.  When I yelped, trying to pull away, I noticed how her skin seemed to become harder to pull off- almost slimy in texture. 

My mouth filled with lake water as I screamed, dragged down with someone’s teeth gripping my thigh. Grey, cold bodies swarmed over me in the water. Biting chunks of flesh. Chewing. Tugging apart. Pulling. Feeding. 

Until I too, would disappear without a trace."

He gathered himself and assessed.  Ripped, dark curtains, cobwebs in virtually every corner, a table littered with amulets and books on the occult.  They were definitely here.

The little one, in a tattered shroud, stood at the top of the staircase, her greasy hair knotted.  She let out a deep, menacing laugh, well beyond what her tiny frame should have been able to produce.  He ascended the stairs, getting close enough to smell the rotten breath that emanated from her low hiss. 

He pulled a dagger from his belt.  His fingers sank perfectly into the deep grooves of its wooden handle.

There, he was met with an officer pointing a gun at him.  “Charles Lima,” the officer commanded, “hands in the air.”  The resolve of the officer weakened as he saw Charles’ blood drenched hands holding a family picture.

Six miles south of the Texas-Oklahoma border, my tire blew out. I’m not sure what it is that did it, but in one moment I was driving and the next my car was spinning out of control. I spiraled into a ditch. I stumbled out of the car into the blowing winds and dusty grounds. There was nothing as far as I could see. It was a wasteland. Then, out of the distance, I saw a smoke cloud billowing. As it got closer, I saw the sun glinting off the top of a black car. I held up my hand, hoping to get a ride. Luckily for me, the car pulled up alongside of me. It was a black Cadillac. The window rolled down, and I was greeted with the sounds of old doo-wop music. A man was sitting inside, dressed in a black suit. His face had a light stubble beard. His eyes were covered in mirrored sunglasses. 

“You want a ride, sport?”  
I nodded.   
“Well then hop in. I’ve got room.”  
As I started to climb into the car, I saw a man standing along the side of the road. He was elderly and hunched over. I could almost hear him say “Don’t get in that car”. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them, he was gone. I climbed into the car. The man started heading out along the road. The first thing that hit me was the uncomfortable heat of the car. It wasn’t horrible; it wasn’t desert sun heat, but it was uncomfortable, the kind of thing that gets under your skin. The man turned down the music. 

“Where you headed, sport?”  
“Kansas.”  
“Kansas? That’s a long way, isn’t it?”  
“Yes, sir.”

“Well, luckily for you, I’m headed up that way. Driving to North Dakota.”  
He extended his hand.   
“The name is Damien. Damien Luck.”

I shook it.

“Harvey Hudson.”

The ride was filled with pleasant conversation. After a few hours had passed, I looked out the window for a moment. I saw my car lying in the ditch, smoke funneling out of the back. 

“Damien?”  
“Yes, sir?”  
“Why are we back here.”  
“Back where?”  
“Where you picked me up?”  
“Because the dead can’t go too far.”  
I turned to him.   
“What did you say?”  
“Tell me, son, are you religious?”  
“Damien, what the hell did you say?”

“You know about all that Heaven and Hell talk? God and the Devil? Well, we have quotas we need to fill; a number of people we need to get each year. Unfortunately for you, people have been good recently. Or they haven’t been dying. You know that old man you saw? Congrats, you saw God. But hey, he couldn’t stop me.”  
“You killed me?”  
“Yessir. Look, don’t be mad. It happens to everyone eventually. Now I think we’ve arrived.”  
The mountains swelled around us, and I began to fall down, down, down. Know this: the devil is real. And he drives a Cadillac."

r96xyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r96xyr/vampire/,Vampire,365,10,1638676682.0,"They all called me “the vampire.” I’d give them a fake chuckle as I’d carry in my tote of tubes and butterfly needles. 

“I vant to take your blood,” they’d say, shoulders hunched, arms raised above their heads. They’d laugh, the patients would laugh, and I’d tie a tourniquet around the patients arm. I’d smile and shake my head.

I know it was harmless and cut the tension, but it annoyed me. The patients already didn’t like me. No one was ever excited to have their blood drawn. Did the staff really have to compare me to a monster? I suspected they joked about it private as well. I mean it was kind of accurate, I had the look: dark hair, tall, thin, pasty skin, and a mandated black uniform. I also worked nights. 

One night I had to draw an old demented lady. As soon as she saw me she began screeching “Vampire!” Staff had to hold her down as she chanted prayers. They stifled giggles. I was humiliated. I stormed into the break room and collapsed into a chair. I then realized I still had a tube of the woman’s blood in my pocket. I couldn’t tell you why, but I popped the top off and threw it’s contents down my throat. I don’t know what disgusted me more, the fact that I had done it, or the fact that I enjoyed it. 

It became a weird addiction. Soon I was drawing an extra tube of blood off every patient. It helped. I could tune out their stupid jokes. All I cared about was getting the blood. I couldn’t concentrate on anything until I drank. I’d go through the motions then rush to hidden places to have a drink. The fresher it was, the better. 

The night I decided to go full vampire was pretty impulsive. I walked into the room of a comatose man and knew this was my chance. I sterilized the area, drew his blood, then brought the crook of his arm up to my mouth. His hot, metallic blood sprayed down my throat as I pulled the tourniquet tighter. It was almost orgasmic. My eyes rolled and I felt weak.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. I threw the arm down and pulled up my mask as a nurse walked in.

“What are you doing?” She asked, definitely sensing that she had startled me. 

“Sorry, just getting blood. I’m a bit jumpy in here. It’s too quiet.” I answered while gesturing to the man.

The nurse pulled out a notepad and started jotting down vital signs. She nodded and replied, “It is quiet. It’s so sad. He’s been here before. Nice guy. He’s not going to make it this time. HIV is one hell of a disease.”"
r96awn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r96awn/the_unconquerable_stench/,The Unconquerable Stench,35,2,1638674496.0,"You smell it. A powerful stench of...feet? No. Something fouler. You look up from your phone, scan the cafe with your eyes; probe the air with your nostrils. The people around you seem oblivious to it. How could they be? The smell is awful, thought-erasing. You look left and right, up and down, but see nothing out of the ordinary; no festering pools, no flaming trash cans, no bubbling baby diapers. Your eyes begin to water, the smell is a tangible, pervasive thing; an immense odour.  

You feel hot, the smell has brought with it a considerable heat; a wave of mounting humidity. You remove your jacket, slowly, so as to not draw attention to yourself. You don’t want people to think you’re mad. The jacket comes off, you casually drape it over the other chair at your table. Everything is fine, everyone is calm. It’s just you—and the smell, *and* its increasingly awful heat. You begin to sweat. The beads fall down your face like tears, and for a moment it feels like you’re crying. You definitely want to. You’re fighting a war on two fronts; the smell before you, the heat at the rear. Uncomfortable circumstances, to say the least.  

The smell is a like grip around your throat, a clothespin on your nose. You detect not one note of foulness, but *many.* It is a conglomerate of stenches; an air-souring amalgam of putridity.  

The heat slaps you, tenderizes your cheeks. You recall how, under times of duress, people have done strange things, and were later exonerated for the breakage of society’s laws; after the necessity of their aberrant behavior was later made obvious. Finding hope in the retroactive justification of your behavior, you remove your clothes and drape them over your jacket.   

People have now noticed you. Some scream. You ignore them, try to endure the heat; concentrate on the smell. You attempt—with Herculean willpower—to fight it, to banish it from the world, through sheer psychological force. Unfortunately, the more you concentrate, the more powerful the smell seems to grow. It has achieved truly profane level of noxiousness; it is plainly not of the Earth. Still, you combat it, determined to die violently if you cannot win. Your nostril hairs burst into flames; smoke trails from your nasal passages. The tears and sweat upon your face evaporate instantly. Your left eye swells, and in a moment of inexpressible agony it pops; splattering your table with blood and eye gunk.  

Consciousness gradually slips away from you; all this time the smell has been snuffing out your life-force. The café has emptied; it’a just you and your mortal enemy. You raise a limp hand, a feeble gesture of defiance, and watch, one-eyed, as the skin melts away from your fingers; as the bones liquify. Death has entered the chat. The heat is truly Hadean: a sweltering, infernal force. Even as your face sags and collapses inward, melting into your skull, you smell it—the unconquerable stench. "

“That’s the spirit boy!”

I kissed his forehead with much love before gently placing him into his comfy bed.

“I love you son!”

“I love you too dad!”

I slowly closed the creaky wooden door, before I leave the ghost-quiet hallway into the warm living room.

And there I see my love, my sweet-bearing eternal muse of my life. Her face delighted with rosy cheeks, a circular-shaped jawline, lips in the shape of an eagle, bristled in a suntanned skin that is as warm as the sun itself.

I gently wrapped her into my own loving arms like sushi, feeling the comfort of her sweater.

“Every moment I spent with you; I question how did I miss you for so long.”

She lets out a cute little giggle. She asked with such a delightful and happy voice.

“Why is that sweet-pea?”

“I did not realize how broken I was until I spent time with you, how sad I was before we talked. It made me correct myself, and it’s all because of you. I love you for that, darling.”

As we danced, my ears picked up a sudden loud rumbling of trash cans outside the door.

“It’s those raccoons again. Hold on love, I’m going to take care of them.”  
 I opened the door with furious anger, and closed the door before I roared onto the little rascals.

“Get out of here you pint-sized pests!”

As I slowly turned around after cleaning the trash, the door is somehow open.

In a shivering stance, I walked into the house to see my love gone. Then, a noise in the kitchen ringed my ears.

I sprinted to find my wife standing still, as if she was frozen. Her rosy cheeks gone, the jaw more distinct, and the skin a little bit lighter than usual.

“Honey, is there anything wrong?”

“No, nothing’s wrong.""

Her voice wasn’t in fear, nor delight, not had she shown any emotion that I remember her for. Something was wrong.

I slowly walked to her to touch her face, only to feel nothing but abysmal arctic-cold. I was too late to realize what was wrong.

I felt a sudden stab in my abdomen, followed by a cold kiss on the lips from my “wife”. I then felt something moving in my throat, and then down into the deep side of my organs. Every flesh burst inside, internal bleeding begun, and I feel more and more holes cutting to the other side. I wanted to scream, but my throat was drowning in blood. I was then dropped on the floor like a toy.

It had been months since we've last seen eachother due to a sudden resignation from his job. The last day he wore that EMT uniform was also the day where I saw the emptiness in his eyes that got me wondering just what he saw in that house whose call I answered.  

A familiar figure shook me out of the thought as I got up from my seat to meet him halfway and the way he hugged me back said all the apologies for days of unanswered messages, days of missed calls, and days of being an absent friend. I hoped that he knew that there was nothing to forgive in the first place and that I will always understand. 

Small talk was thrown out of the window as he wasted no time explaining the horror that got him retreating to his shell and away from soceity. 

I remember answering a 9-1-1 call where a woman was screaming for help relaying that her husband was trying to stab her. Red and blue sirens soon glowed on that night of October as the cops and EMT's made their way towards that well rounded neighborhood. 

A release of breath was made before the cup met his lips, like the bitter liquid would summon the courage he needed to continue the story. 

His eyes focused on his intwined fingers as he said that the moment the officer got the screaming husband out of the house, him and his partner were left to assist the woman who laid in her own blood, a sliver of life still evident in her soft intake of breaths, on that cold and weary hallway.

Tears kissed his eyes and he immediately covered them as I reassured him that it was ok to stop but he soldiered on. It took a while for him to find composure and when he did, I finally understood why he did what he did.

The woman laid dying in that house with a ripped belly and on her left was a baby, covered in stab wounds, whose umbilical cord was still attached to its placenta that was still inside its mother. 

A desperation laced her voice as she weakly begged 

""Please save my baby.""

Death arrived before them and my friend left that house dead as well. 

We exited that cafe as different people with hope for humanity running on thin ice. 

Talk of the husband's account made its round in our building and its tale added even more monstrosity to the tragedy of that October night. 

The story goes that in the middle of an argument they both confessed to  infidelity and when the wife, in a burst of anger, screamed that the baby wasn't his, he lost it.

'Fucking bitch' he spat, as blood trickled out his mouth. You see Dave is here slowly dying all alone because he found his wife sleeping with another man earlier that day. 

He had no where to go so he has just been dragging himself through the snow filled roads of his little village. He made his way to the only pub for miles, he has no emotions and couldn't feel anything. He longed to feel something, needed to feel anything, so he picked up a pool que, walked over to Butch, the hard man around town, and with one pathetic swing whacked him across the back. 

Butch stood up, looked this frail middle aged man in the face, he seen his eyes full of hurt, fear and broken, as much as it pained him Butch couldn't let that slide, he grabbed him round the scruff of the neck dragged him outside and punched him repeatedly, screaming at him is this what you want? 

Dave had a crimson mask, broken nose and he was sure he had lost some teeth, all wasn't lost though, he managed to get a bottle of his favourite whisky from the bar. 

He dragged himself through the snow, found a wall and slumped himself against it, he was going to sit there, drink his whisky and let this blizzard end his suffering.

Back to the present, the snow surrending him had been dyed red, quarter of his whisky was left. Daves drunked mind was in overdrive, why did she do this, how could she do this, how long has this been going on for. One thing is for sure he thought, I'm not going without taking her with me. 

Weakly he got to his feet, trudged through the snow to his home, kicked the door open, 'honey I'm home!' He yelled. 

His wife came running downstairs, wondering where he had been, she seen him covered in blood and snow, stinking of whisky taken aback she froze at the bottom step.

Dave closing in on her, he raised his arm holding that was holding the bottle, and slammed it over her head, she crashed to the floor, a pool of blood slowly forming.

“That it is.” I agreed, and she blushed at my directness. Several years of marriage and she still wasn’t use to my forwardness. I shot her a wink as the light turned green and we sped off towards home.

Late at night after I finished using the bathroom, I heard Mia’s voice again.

“I know you’re not happy where you are. Cross the divide.”

“Mia…?” I called out in the direction I heard her voice.

“Come be with me, Lucas.” her mellifluous voice chimed from the kitchen.

Turning the light on, I saw Mia behind the glass door of our back patio.

But she was just asleep in the bed.

Why did she get up, and more importantly, why was she outside so late at night?

It must have been absolutely chilly. Waves of shadow fanned out as the wind whipped through her silky raven hair, those beautiful lips that reminded me of cupid’s bow curled upward, hand pressed against the glass door.

Running over, I unlocked the door to let her in but she stepped back and held her arms out.

“Join me.”

My vision shifted, peripheries casting everything that wasn’t my wife into darkness. Flickers of light twinkling like stars blinked in and out of existence and just as I was about to cross the threshold, the door was slammed shut.

“Lucas, you’re letting all the damn heat out of the house.”

Mia frowned, arms covering herself. Her scolding stare became one of concern.

“You were just...when did you...”  my lungs felt as if they were on fire.

“Jesus, Lucas you’re as pale as a ghost,” she put her hand to my forehead, “you’re freezing! We need to get you to bed.”

I came down with a severe case of the flu and had to take off of work for a week, Mia watching like a hawk the whole time, as if lucidity escaped me.

But I’m not the only one acting bizarre, recently she’s begun hanging iron ornaments all around the house, says its a decorative change of pace.  Also, she’s clasped an iron necklace around my neck that I can’t remove. I haven’t heard or seen the other Mia since.

To be honest, I don’t think the woman I’m living with is my wife at all. Her words are more hollow by the day and it’s not just her.

My friends.

All of it is fake, made of aged parchment. Sometimes I stare at the faux blue sky and wonder if I’ll be able to join my real wife. I wonder if I’ll be able to cross the divide."

""Well, won't you look at that,"" she said, pointing to the thumbprint I left behind on the counter. ""It looks just like your birthmark.""

She was right. The thumbprint was the same shape and size as the Manhattan birthmark. Curious, I dabbled my thumb in the blood from my finger and pressed it on the birthmark. The lines of my print wove around like a children's puzzle. One entrance, and one destination. 

Mandy, being Mandy, took a quick picture and then downloaded and printed it out so she could decipher the route. After a few attempts she had it. 

""Now, all I need is a map,"" she told her husband, Barry. 

""Don't be entertaining that stupid notion, Mandy. The boy doesn't need you adding to his heavy life. Let him be.""

I've always liked Barry. A stern, but fair, Irish man. But that wasn't going to stop her. 

Lucky for us, we only live in Chester, New Jersey, so it wasn't long before we were in Manhattan entertaining her stupid notion. I was as much pushing for this as she was. 

For an hour, paper map flying in the city breeze, we found the shop. A small delicantasant. It was boarded up. Derelict. But as soon I touched the door, it swung open. 

We crept through. Wind blew up from a doorway where a path led down some stone steps to a basement below. With the light of my phone, Mandy and I descended. 

At the bottom, a room opened up. Two skeletons hung from nooses. Scraps of clothes, dirty with age draped off boney shoulders. 

But underneath them all was a message. It read: I killed your family. You'll be next. Follow your other thumb I'd you want to understand why.

I didn't understand, until I saw a scrap of paper with a map of London on it. Dizzy with horror, I reopened my wound and dabbed my other thumb down on the map. It lined up perfectly. 

I'm scared to find out who is behind this. But I think I have to. To avenge my family."

I have made it my mission in life to purify haunted bodies and where there is passion there is determination. The determination to do what needs to be done to cure haunted bodies and I remember my first one. It was a man in his 50s and I went up to him and I told him about haunted bodies and that his body was haunted. He looked at me in such an unfriendly fashion but I just smiled like I had just taken his girlfriend away from him. 

I then picked up a rock and smashed it against his head. Then I waited a moment and as I watched him shake a little, his body stood still. Then a glow of light came out of him like a little ball and floated away. I was so happy that I cured a body from being haunted and things are always better when they are not haunted. I knew this man was grateful that I made his body not haunted anymore even though he wasn't showing any signs of gratitude. It doesn't matter majority of humans never show gratitude. 

Then the next person who I wanted to help make her body not haunted anymore, was a woman of professional stature. She had a fancy car and she was always talking on the phone in a business like tone, she had no idea that her body was haunted. I wanted to help her so much and so when she unlocked her car I rushed in and got us both in her car. She was crying and scared but I told that I was here to help with her haunted body but she wasn't having it. I shot her once and as I saw her fighting the haunted thing inside her body by spewing blood, I saw the glowing thing again floating out of her. Her body was no longer haunted. 

I told someone of my good deeds and he told me that our bodies aren't haunted and that they have souls inside them, but souls are still like ghosts that haunt the body. I must up my game and free multiple haunted bodies at the same time, time to get a gun."

r8oxsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r8oxsj/every_evening/,EVERY EVENING,150,9,1638621864.0," 

Julia stared into the dining room, her face almost touching the window pane, as she did every evening.  

It was still light outside, the curtains were drawn back and she could easily see her husband, Charles, the man who vowed to love her, seated at the dinner table together with this other woman. And a teenage boy. Was he Charles’s son? She had no idea, even though she had been Charles’s wife for three years.  

They were talking and laughing, eating chicken with potatoes and salad. Charles reached for the wine. The teenager asked for some. His mother shook her head, but laughed, and Charles mixed some wine with water in a small glass before handing it to the boy.  

The emotions were as raw as the first day Julia found out, rooted in this same spot she stood now. Disbelief, bewilderment, confusion, numbing shock, slowly slipping away to pure fury. She had wanted to break the window, leap into the room, howling and smashing the glinting glasses and plates, and grind the smiling happy faces of Charles and his secret family into the shards, hear them scream in agony, see their blood splatter everywhere. She saw herself grab this woman’s long red hair, twist it around her fist and smash her head into the wall. Stab Charles repeatedly with the long sharp knife. How could he do this to her?  

She still wanted to do all that, she just couldn’t. Tears of helpless agony ran down her face.  

Julia remembered all the nights he worked late. The work trips away. God it was so cliché, so obvious. Like every other woman fooled since time immemorial- he had played her for a fool, which she was. The signs had been there- the bills not adding up, the excuses, the delays. And then, one day, a year ago, she had followed him to an address she had found on a bill in his pocket. The last day of her marriage.  

Even though the marriage was over that very first night she found out, she couldn’t help coming back, every evening, staring at them have dinner together, and dream of vengeance and murder. 

She had watched them eat dinner every single evening since that night, unable to stop herself. She knew all their food quirks by now, how the boy fussed if his different foods “touched” each other on the plate, how the mom piled up salad on her plate to control calories.  

She knew she had to stop, she had to stop going back every evening, she had to let go. But she was powerless – every evening at the same time, she would find herself outside their window, until she could no longer bear it, and sobbing with pain and rage she would turn away and rush blindly into the street, colliding with a speeding car.  

Exactly the same as that first evening, more than a year ago, when she had died instantly on impact. "

I have caught her out on a couple of occasions and proved that she was incorrect. She would then pull that stupid open mouthed shocked face for a few seconds. She would then refuse to speak to me for a few days until I eventually caved and apologised to her.

Lately she has been driving me crazy as she won a local trivia quiz and has been bragging about it nonstop. She would always smirk and tell me that I am so lucky to have a mother as intelligent as her. I decided to take her down  peg or two.

I forced her to sit down in a chair in our living room and told her the rules of our quiz. If she got all the questions right then I will bring her out for dinner but if she gets any wrong then she will be punished. She reluctantly agreed to take part in the quiz.

I was starting to get worried as the quiz progressed because she was getting all of the questions right. I decided to throw in an awkward one for the last question. I asked her for the name of main actor in the 2003 film The Room. She sat there open mouthed and I knew that I had caught her out.

I told her that the name of the actor was Tommy Wiseau. Her face went deathly pale as I reached for the pliers and attached it to her fingernail. I couldn't help but smile smugly listening to her scream of agony as I ripped out her fingernail. Maybe from this point forward she will learn to be a bit more humble"

The House was no longer stationary

Unhinged, the door flapped wide

An empty stomach hidden inside


The hall carpet lolled like a tongue

Broken pipes and cables hung

It shuffled down the vacant street

Slowly, on splintered makeshift feet


It looked at rows of beautiful homes

The warm glow of life it had never known 

It wanted, no needed occupants 

Whether willing or resistant


It creaked and groaned as it made its way

Scooped up dog walkers, business talkers starting their day

It gobbled a crowd waiting for the bus

A whole old residence home (they made no fuss)


A playground of smoking teens

Old, young anyone that was seen

They rolled down its dusty, cobwebbed hall

To fill the abode from wall to wall


Now full to the brim the town stood silent

It never intended to be so violent

But after standing so alone 

It needed bodies to call it home"

I sighed, closed my book and looked outside. A face stared back at me.
 
Just the face. No body or neck. No bony fingers that tapped my window. It floated outside, the gingery hair wild in the wind and waving around like a nest of hissing snakes. Rain dripped down bony white cheeks.
 
The eyes bulged out, veins popping out of the whites and stormy-blue irises. The nose was long and thin, with snake-holes for nostrils. The lips were painted crimson, the mouth wide open in a smile, revealing pearly-white fangs.
 
And still came that ghastly *tap tap tap* sound. “Let me in,” the face whispered.
 
I hurriedly closed the curtains, double-checked my locks, and leaned against the wall, my breath coming out in short gasps. My heart was beating so hard against my ribs I thought it might fracture. All I could think about was that face.
 
To distract myself, I pulled out my phone and began surfing the Internet, hoping to take my mind off things. I looked at the funniest memes on Reddit and was laughing out loud when I got a ping.
 
From an unknown number.
 
The profile picture was **the face**.
 
*can i come in* 
 
My heart started to pound again. I turned off my phone, and there it was on the shiny black screen, leering back at me, unwavering.
 
I slowly turned around.
 
There was no one there. No floating face.
 
I forced myself to calm down. Maybe I just needed to get some sleep.
 
I headed to my bedroom, keeping a wary eye out for any intruders or pranksters. I changed into my pyjamas and prepared to brush my teeth. As I looked in the mirror, the colour drained out of my face.
 
Until it was bone-white. My eyes started to swell until I could see the veins, my irises turning a deep blue. My nose grew smaller; my eyebrows settling itself into place. My lips grew redder; my mouth widened into a sinister smile. Pearly-white fangs emerged from under my teeth and grew outwards into twin walrus tusks.
 
Then my bone-white face cracked, revealing crimson scars.
 
I stared in horror at the face, *my* face, smiling back at me.

I should be joyous, or melancholic... angry or hurting... anything but this *numbness*. I should be... *more* than this... 

The darkness surrounds me, embraces me, wants me, needs me... more than I need myself. 

The sleeping breaths of my children down the hallway aren't enough to make me want to stay... I need to feel more than the nothingness inside. The darkness calls me.

As the blade rips through my flesh, the blood pours forth in a wave of ecstasy, of freedom, of release.

It was like any other evening. My father smoking his pipe by the fire. My mother knitting in the other room. It was, however, especially cold that night, with howling winds and snow. But we were safe inside.  

Then came a knock at the door. 

It seemed unreal at first. We did not live near town or any road. We were surrounded by forest on every side except for a slim dirt path. 

The knocking came again, louder, followed by a moaning. My parents let the desperate stranger in. 

The stranger said very little. He appeared weak and disheveled. My mother gave him stew and my father his pipe. Then they retreated into their room to talk and left me alone with him. 

It was only when we were alone that he looked at me. His eyes were blue and his skin white as bone. I noticed, too, that his nails were exceptionally long. Yet I wasn’t repulsed by him. Afraid, yes, but at the same time attracted to him. 

Demap sat there puffing the pipe my father gave him, blowing Os up toward the portrait of my great grandfather hanging above the mantle. Then he spoke.

“Now this is an ugly man,” he said, pointing to the portrait, and I laughed. It was such a rude thing to say, though it’s true my grandfather was quite ugly. 

Then I asked him where he’d come from. 

“Young man, would you believe me if I told you I crawled out of a dream?”

Yes, that’s what he said. It was such a fantastical thing to say, I thought he was joking so I laughed. Even today I don’t know what he meant by that. 

My parents returned and told Demap that my father could bring him to town in the morning to see the doctor. He agreed and thanked my parents. My father offered him my bed, so I slept in his chair by the fire. 

Demap was standing over me when I woke up. I noticed then how tall he was, and that he was wearing my father’s clothing. 

“Where are my parents?” I asked him.

“They’ve gone into town to fetch the doctor,” he told me. “They should be back any minute.”

As you know, that was a lie. Demap had killed my parents, violently, he would later tell me. He loved the pain people felt, not only when you injured them, but at all times. “The agony of existence,” he called it. It was like he could sense it, the suffering of others. He would smell it in the air and differentiate one sort from another. The pain I felt at the loss of my parents was, to him, a delicacy; and my innocence kept it fresh for longer than most.

I was his ward until I turned 17, at which time he sent me off with a large sum of money, a knife and my father’s pipe."

She’d sat across from him awkwardly giggling and swirling a straw in her drink. They talked about typical first date things. After a few drinks he asked her to tell him something she’d never told anyone before.

She nervously giggled and shyly told him about her hamsters. How when she was a child she had a hamster. One day it bit her. She’d reacted by squeezing it until it no longer moved. She didn’t want her mom to find out what had happened, so she stuck it’s lifeless body back in the cage. There was a new hamster in the cage the next day after school. She laughed and told him that she had probably like 10 different hamsters growing up.
It was fucked up, but adorable. 
Their next date, he brought a hamster and they dissected it together. Then they made love. 

Their relationship moved fast after that. She moved in two weeks later. He felt like he had known her his whole life.They spent their date nights roaming the streets, looking for strays. 

On their one month anniversary he bought her an empty charm bracelet and a dog from the pound. As she cut open it’s stomach a heart shaped charm fell out. As he clipped the charm to the bracelet, she cried and told him no one had ever done anything so romantic for her. It became their thing. Within six months her bracelet was full. He knew he had to do something big.

Two weeks after their six month anniversary, he blindfolded her and led her to the basement. She looked so cute in her surgical gown. He removed her blindfold, she clapped her hand over her mouth, and her eyes welled with tears. It had been so easy to get the homeless man to come home with him. It’d been even easier to drug and force feed him. 

He was so nervous as she dove the knife into the man’s abdomen, blood spraying both of them. He figured every guy felt like this before they popped the big question. After several minutes of digging around she finally found the ring. He took it from her and dropped to one knee. Of course she said yes. They passionately kissed. She giggled as she wiped a splotch of blood from his cheek.

He knew they’d live happily ever after."

Mostly I hear my own heart-beat, and a kind of ringing. I can tell that I’m somewhere far from people, but there are no signs of life. No signs of animals even, not even the call of a familiar bird or an unfamiliar one. 

I am tied with rope, which is smart, I think. Chains I could slip out of. Chains cannot be pulled tight, but rope is different. Rope can be knotted and pulled so taught, gosh, taught enough that I am having trouble feeling my fingers. I know they’re there, I think I can wiggle them, but they are not able to slip the ropes from my wrists. It has to be rope… and my feet are the same, anchored to a heavy wooden chair so large I cannot rock it. I cannot shuffle my way out… a throne! My very own throne! Or perhaps it is my casket.

I think I might die here.
How did this happen? I was walking… I do that sometimes. I feel lost a lot and sometimes when you feel that way the best thing to do is get lost yourself… so I walk. Tonight I walked a little too far. I might have even left the town-limits entirely. But there were houses, and there were streets so I kept walking because it felt right. 

“Got a cig?” He said, slurred, stinking: I could smell the smoke on him so I don’t know why he was asking for another.

“No.” Did I need to say more than that? I kept walking, keeping my eyes to myself. I thought of him as a nobody, maybe that was my mistake. I didn’t think he’d cause a fuss. I didn’t think there would be trouble, until I felt a sharp crack, like a bell ringing. I felt a wetness down my forehead, a stinging in my eyes, as blackness took me.
Why would they want somebody like me? A nobody. I’m not famous, I don’t have family or friends… I don’t think my job would pay a week’s pay to keep me alive. That’s got me curious… I can only imagine they’ve taken me for the worst of reasons. 

Gut me and sell my organs for cheap, or maybe they just want to slice me up because it’ll feel good. I get that, I think maybe I’m just a way for them to feel alive. But you know what… I won’t let ‘em. All I have to do is bite my tongue hard, and swallow whatever piece comes off. Let it hang in my throat, and breathe it in… and you know what?

Whatever.
I start taking notes. It breaks.

Now I can't bring myself to care. looking back at it they feel like a different person, so in a way they aren't my memories to mourn.

I thought that it had been just a temporary stage of getting to know a new person in the household but the way Fern growled whenever my baby was in the room indicated that she was ready for a violent act. 

It felt like abandonment when I handed Fern's leash to my sister and my heart broke when the pup kept looking back at me with questioning eyes as they walked away. 

My sister promised to update me and send pics and videos of Fern but that did not deter the sadness that wrecked my chest.

 I allowed myself to mourn when I got back to my vehicle, the tears came in floods when I thought about how Fern gave us years of unconditional love only for me to repay her this way.

I came home and was greeted by heavy silence when I was so used to hearing paws tapping on the floor...empty wouldn't even begin to describe it.

The first night without my pup came the howlings.

Echo after echo covered our surroundings like an unwelcomed shroud. The canine tones varied from anger to whines, its as if they were begging us to leave. 

I stayed up as sleep didn't come and gave my focus on my sleeping son. Barely a month old and the world was already cruel to him and just when I thought I couldn't cry anymore, that thought was enough to break me. 

All I wanted was for my child to grow up loved and prayed that God would hear me.

I didn't even let him buy me a drink. I chatted a bit, I didn't want to be rude, but when he kept on with his advances, I told him no. It's hard to mistake a no. Yet he still yelled after me as I left, crying that I was leading him on. Later, I saw him again... That was what was my fault. Ending up back at his place, that was my fault. I don't even know how it happened. I didn't want to do it.

The final straw was when I saw him standing outside my front door as I was pulling into my driveway. Heart racing, I jammed my car into reverse and drove to the trailhead. I needed to walk to clear my head. It was going to be dark soon, so I grabbed a headlamp and went on my way. At the top of the trail, I went straight instead of following the bend that would take me back down the mountain. There was a clearing up ahead that I always go to when I am stressed.

The trees and  deepening darkness surrounded me, a blanket from any unwanted eyes. Once I reached the spot I froze. He was there, arrogantly staring me down, the setting sun casting him in an angry lurid light. Hurriedly I rushed to him, forcing him to step aside. I didn't hear his shouts as I dug at the spot he was standing on.

Pine needles stabbed into my hands as I scooped handfuls of earth and threw them at him. The last remnants of light faded as my hands brushed fabric. Holding my breath I swept the dirt away, moving up the length of the red fabric. There he was, right where he should be, his open eyes covered in a film of dirt and death. I turned and there he was, standing over me. I couldn't hear what he said, but I could read his lips. ""No one says no to me."""

""Stand up. We've got to keep going,"" said Bertram shaking John's shoulder.

John wiped his tears and looked up at his friend.

The forest was dark and cold. It seemed like the winter at this place never ends.

""You're right,"" said John standing up. ""We need to bring him to his family. He should be buried next to them.""

He adjusted a rifle hanging on his shoulder. Together, they lifted up the body wrapped in several layers of dirty fabric and headed West. They were not far from the burial grounds.

""I hope we'll be able to give him a proper funeral. The Commander said that his whole village is buried there, so he will rest next to his loved ones."" Said Bertram breathing heavily.

""Yes. Let's drink something after it's done,"" John replied. ""I can't stand it anymore.""

A blinding ray of light made friends stop. Suddenly, they couldn't see anything but heard a motion sound. Then a loud voice pierced the silence.

""Stay still! Drop it on the ground, and put your hands up!""

Quickly but carefully, they put the body on the snow and raised their arms.

""Numbers!"" yelled the voice.

""Private #100826!"" yelled John as loud as he could.

""Private #100501!"" Bertram followed his friend.

Suddenly, the light went off. The friends slowly opened their eyes.

A man in a uniform stood right next to the body they brought. It was the Commander himself.

""Report, private. Are you from the second division? Coming from the East?"" he asked Bertram.

""Yes, sir! This is the villager from Miria. We brought him here for burial. We need to find the...""

""Great!"" interrupted the Commander. Then he yelled loudly, ""Open the gates! They brought the last one!"".

John sighed in relief.

""Finally, we'll give him a proper funeral,"" he said.

Massive metal gates began to open with a loud screeching sound. A cloud of heavy smoke was hanging in the thick air. Soon the friends were surrounded by dozens of military men - all were cheering, laughing, and shooting in the sky.

""It's over! We won!"" could be heard everywhere.

The Commander pointed at the opened gates.

""You'll find the cemetery there,"" he said smiling. ""Thank you for your service, soldiers.""

The friends lifted up the body and walked into the gates. A heavy smoke surrounded them, and it became hard to breathe and see.

""What's that?.."" asked John quietly. Suddenly, he screamed in terror.

They were standing on the edge of a giant pit. The pit was so deep, they couldn't see the bottom. Bodies... Mountains of bodies were piling up all over the pit. Men, women, children, elders. Fire could be seen in some places. Enormous fans were working fast, eliminating the smell.

""Throw it in, the war is over! You brought the last one! The land is ours!"" someone yelled cheerfully.

Shaking, Bertram pulled out his gun and put it to his temple. Tears were running down his cheeks."

That’s what they called it, our basement. The Chapel Below. Like naming it that would change the nature of what it was.

They’d throw me to the ground, chain me up before the cross, and then, uh, then they’d put the mask on. 

It enveloped my skull perfectly. Needles digging into skin - making sure I’d never move, never close my eyes, never avert my gaze, lest I wanted them all holey-like and pulled out with the mask. A long metal bar attached at back of my head kept my neck up at *juuuuust* the right angle.

So I could see. So I could behold.

*For the Glory,* they’d say.

Sometimes it took mere minutes. Sometimes excruciating hours. Sometimes they kept me down there for days at the time. To hear the screams. To witness every lash of the whip. To watch as thick streams of blood poured down the cross.

*For the Glory of Your Redeemer.*

*Can you see it?* my father would ask. 

I saw the terror in their eyes. I heard the torment in their guttural shrieks. I felt their dying breath on my face. How many? Too many to count. Yet I remember them all. Every last one. Every face. Every voice.

Every Redeemer, like flesh puppets for my parents to twist and mangle and warp beyond recognition.

One of them fell apart at the seams, did I tell you that? Tiny thing he was, couldn’t have been older than five or six years old. Limbs weren’t strong enough to hold him up there you see, so on the second day they just…gave in.

*Can you see it?*

He lived for another day or so, little but a head on a torso. They lifted him back up and tied him to that cross, and then they whipped and they lashed and they prodded and they stabbed, until there was nothing left to whip or lash or prod or stab.

Then they’d remove the mask, and they’d ask me if I’d seen it, and then they’d make me clean the cross and take care of the Redeemers, or whatever was left of them anyway.

My answer was always the same though.

*Did you see it?*

Yes, I saw it. I saw it every time. Every eternity hidden in every second hidden in every moment. It takes a special eye, you see. Blink, and you’ll miss it. Miss HIS message, shrouded in the pain and the fear and the screams and the torture. HIS manifesto, for all of us to learn, but just a handful of us to document.

That’s why you’re here. I have grown old and weary, and my eyes cannot bear witness anymore. So, my son, I will need you to pay close attention as I hammer in the nails. 

You know now what you must do.

Behold, boy. Witness.

For the Glory of Your Redeemer."

I woke, or perhaps just roused from ease, suckling like a swaddled babe. My lips pursed and pulled without thirst, an instinct without evolutionary wisdom, for which I was rewarded with frigid gouts of slippery brine. My head swam, the soft pulsing squeeze of worldly neglect pulling my conscious—uh—brain goop (*goop?…fuck*) down and 

down 

&nbsp;

and

&nbsp;

^down

into the hollow gulping depths of the sea. 

But maybe that was just the booze talking…or the lack of oxygen. I heard Grigori shout something before I climbed the ladder to the high dive. It sounded like “There goes father Indra—clucking fool!” Grigori was prone to fanciful outbursts like that when I was fucked up. 

I didn’t pay him any mind. I jumped and tucked and slid into the warm water like a drop of summer rain. Graceful as a goddamn swan. 

——
**The Aboleth**

From the darkened depths I watched, swimming through the aether. A drunkard saw my sea below, a swimming hole beneath her. I called to her in silence as a watcher’s wont to do. She heard me as though dreaming and the dream is all she knew. I gave to her the succor of the dark and endless plane. To slake a thirst for vision while the darkness offered pain. 

Now dive, little water fowl, you shan’t fall very far. The sea is here to catch you, ~~pretty morsel~~ falling star. So come and share the deep with me, this salt-parched reservoir. I was seasoning the water, while you pickled at the bar.

I hadn’t realized how fucked Mila was until she climbed the ladder to the high dive. Fifteen feet into a twelve foot deep diving well. She cackled the whole way up, raving about swans and the ocean. As she bounced on the end of the diving board, I shouted, “There’s no water in the fucking pool!”  But she just smiled and shook her head and dove. 

Twenty seven feet onto concrete. I heard her head hit, somewhere between a crunch and a splat, while not truly being either. *Splunch*, maybe. By the time I got down to the bottom, there was a river of blood creeping down the drain. She had landed head first. It was the only time I’ve ever seen an actual human brain. 

She was dead. Well, I guess that’s obvious, but in the dark wet sheen of her open head, I swear, I saw something move. An eye opening from blood-sodden chewed bubble gum mass of her cerebellum."

Criss Seymour Jr. had been born without any particular complications on a mild September afternoon that experienced no harsh weather. Seventeen hours later, after the doctors all convened on the obvious fact that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the boy, he was allowed to go back home to his parents and continue a placid, if somewhat average existence. 

&#x200B;

He would go on to attend preschool at four, middle school at twelve, high school at sixteen, and finally, a local two-year community college at twenty. All the while maintaining a perfectly average score that hinted at neither hidden genius, nor underlying stupidity.

&#x200B;

It wasn't until his twenty-third birthday that he first picked up a guitar, seemingly at random, inadvertently giving birth to his new self. And consequently, his new life: *Groef*.

&#x200B;

Before, he had been nothing, been no one. Destined to live an anonymous life of absolute mediocrity. Born one day. Dead the next.

&#x200B;

But the crowd had changed that for him; choosing him for something far greater.

&#x200B;

A rock god they called Groef. 

&#x200B;

Now, forty years later, he stood on-stage one more time; one last time. His fans a sea of eyes that cried at his sight; an ensemble of mouths chanting his name in holy unison; an army of hands and fingers and palms, all reaching for him, however close or far they might be. 

&#x200B;

He played for them because they were everything.

Because they had given him everything.

Because they had made him everything he was today.

&#x200B;

He’d been born Criss Seymour Jr., but they had christened him Groef through their relentless adoration. Through rehabs and eventual relapses, through marriages and inevitable divorces; they had sided with him; loved him, unconditionally.

&#x200B;

So now, having given them all, Groef edged closer and closer to the fringes of the stage, picking up speed with every step. He was ready to give them what was left of his person. Launching himself off stage, he dove into the crowd below head-first.

&#x200B;

Within seconds, they welcomed him with a hundred hands, caressing his features at first, gently combing his hair and pulling at his clothes. But in their haste, some of the fabric tore, revealing more of him under it.

&#x200B;

More to collect.

&#x200B;

Soon, there was not an inch of his body that wasn't theirs to love. 

&#x200B;

To touch with their very own hands.

&#x200B;

To finally own for themselves after years of untold veneration.

&#x200B;

Here was their god.

&#x200B;

Groef.

&#x200B;

He was theirs, and they were his.

&#x200B;

They kissed him, and kisses promptly became chomps as they sank their teeth into him.   

&#x200B;

They pulled him apart, limb from limb, sinew by sinew. Drinking from his blood; eating from his flesh.

&#x200B;

It was a magnificent feast; every one of them had their fill. Only Groef didn't scream, he never begged; no curses left his mouth. Once, they had given him their each and everything, so now, as the curtain of his life finally came to a close, he, in turn, gave them his all."

It was a casual outing with friends that day, friends of mine were just like me, we were a ruthless gang. Enroute we saw a woman who was standing at the middle of the road... The road onto which we were travelling was too narrow and at both sides were railing, it was a cliff. 

I was the one driving hence I blowed the horn in continuity but to no avail, she didn't seem in the mood to step aside. 

Finally I stopped the car just a feet away from her and stepped out of the car... I yelled at her and the very next moment she attacked me... She scratched my face with her long nails... She then tried to choke me to death, I had no option left in self defence but to take my gun out and so I did. I killed her, I had to fire otherwise she'd have killed me...whilst in pain she pulled me towards her and kissed me... I was intrigued... It was kinda shocking and disturbing... 

We drove away from there, I had already informed the police. Whilst driving my nails seemed to have grown a bit larger, I had cut them just a day before the incident, I didn't mind and moved on. 

We'd travelled quite far from the city hence decided to rest in a motel we happened to have seen enroute... 

The sense of being 'Peter' that is me was slowly being lost.... When Rebecca called my name I was like 'Peter?' who's Peter... 

We all slept after a tiresome and fearful day... At night I woke up and sat in front of the mirror installed in our room, I saw a beautiful young lady in the mirror... By this time the sense of being 'ME' was almost lost, some text appeared on the mirror which read, 

'Just a kiss it takes to transform thee, into the beautiful version which once was me, which I time and again lose to the laws of nature, as I grow old I rediscover my stature. By kissing the person he or she, they shall transform into the beauty I always will be, just a cell it takes which I leave, on the lip of the person who then I live'"

the moon domes are pretty much what the name implies. giant domes on the surface of the moon. within the domes are cities the size of new york. they have everything that humans could need. there are big cities full of buildings, restaurants, theaters, and other such things. however, for those who prefer the simple life, there are also suburb esk places within the dome for people to live as well. the domes are filled with the life sustaining oxygen that the people of earth so often take for granted. there are a total of six moon domes that were built on the surface of the moon. they are named moon dome 1, moon dome 2, moon dome 3, moon dome 4, moon dome 5, and of course moon dome 6. each of them are the same size and width. the only difference between the six is that the cities and suburbs within look slightly different.

after the domes were built, the moon was deemed safe for humans to live on. as such, people began to move to the domes to start a new life for themselves and their families. everything was going fine...until...

large claw marks were found outside moon dome 4. it was then that the people within the domes started to question if the moon truly was safe...and if they were truly alone on the moon."

It was about 1:00am and I was alone because my neighbor who usually walks with me from work home had the day off. Living in a big city, usually there are people outside during the night either partying or looking for some type of hardcore drug. Tonight however it was different. No one was in sight at all. Ofc I have the Heebie jeebies and start to have a aniexty attack but what do you expect being alone walking in the dark. So I’m walking and I start to get that feeling someone is behind me, I pick up my speed and clutch my work bag. Trying to peak through the corner of my eye to see if someone is behind me I trip over me feet and face plant into the sidewalk. I almost knocked myself out but manage to get back up and gather all my things. As I try to stand up and man is in front of me with his hand out trying to help. He is very handsome looking guy. He had a cast on his arm, driving a yellowish buggy. As I get up and brush myself off he ask if I could help him put some boxes in his car. I felt bad for the dude so I helped him. As I’m setting the first big box in the bag of his car I’m suddenly being strangled. Everything goes black.
I wake up to find myself being dumped right by the woods. I get up looking around trying to find some sort of humanity to get help. No one is to be seen then I get a good glimpse of something. There is a body on the ground. Headless. I freak out and start throwing up but I noticed something about the body…we have the same tattoo, same painted finger nails, and same clothes. It’s me. It’s my body on the ground. I’m dead. The guy had cut my head off. Not a very clean cut if I say so myself. Did I mention that it was 1974?"

“Honey can’t we just forget about this? I swear to god if that assclown John makes one more comment about Affirmative Action I will not be responsible for myself. And you look so good I wanna just be with you right now!” Colin was pleading.

Monique carefully put the final touches to her make-up before turning round to her husband.

He caught his breath. In her fuchsia evening gown, she gave Michelle Obama vibes. He held his arms out to her. 

Monique laid a glossy tipped finger across his lips. “Baby. We’re going. First, I’ve been in this godforsaken town since September and this is the first invite I’ve got. Second, you don’t believe in god, and you do not let that man get under your skin. And third…” she gave a slow chuckle and looped her arms round his neck “you clean up quite nicely yourself darling”. She gave him a deep kiss, a promise of delights to come if he behaved himself at this stupid department dinner. 

The faces around the dinner table were all white, an Indian and an Iranian faculty member lending the only splashes of colour before Monique and Colin joined. As luck would have it, they were seated across John and his wife Laura, causing both men to grimace internally.

But things started well enough. Laura was gracious to Monique, showing deep interest in her hometown, and making lots of promises about getting together again soon for coffee and profuse apologies for not having done so earlier “so busy, you know, I kept telling John”. 

As the department Chair’s fine wine started to flow, things loosened up, and guffaws of laughter could be heard as old insider jokes were wheeled out. Colin loosened his tie and just as he let his guard down, John said it for the first time that evening. Affirmative Action. 

Colin took an extra big sip of wine. John hadn’t been even talking to him, but he was talking loudly enough. Monique heard it too, and looked over with a little shake of her beautifully coiffed head, laying her hand on his thigh. 

John was talking faster and louder. Then he said it again- in the same sentence as “academic freedom”. The Iranian prof nodded, and glanced over at Colin, a quizzical look in his sad dark eyes. 

Colin forgot he was an atheist, and sent up a desperate prayer of help, which happened to land just right.

“…and they ask for your ethnicity on grant applications! Why? Why do they need to know the colour of your skin to know if you can do research? Huh?” John’s voice was surprisingly loud, for a polite dinner party. 

The Iranian prof shrugged helplessly and stabbed a piece of chicken.

“I am telling you, Affirmative Action…”

A silent bolt of fire came from nowhere and consumed John with a flash. His chair was empty save a pile of ashes. 

The profs and their spouses looked at each other, and then continued eating."

My daughter wrote to Santa last year. A list as short as the elf is tall. She wanted two things. An elf on the shelf and a pony. 

Suffice it to say, I wasn't going to buy her a pony. We didn't have a paddock and I didn't have the money or time to care for such a thing. But that didn't stop one showing up. 

The elf showed up on Dec 1st. A ragtag scruffy thing with burnt clothes missing one eye and a wicked grin on its face. My wife said she didn't buy the thing when it turned up on top of our refrigerator. 

Bella loved it instantly. What could I do? That night leading to Dec 2, we heard something moving around the house. Light went on, I went in search. I found flour spread out on the kitchen surface. One of Bella's dolls tied at the wrist and ankles amidst the carnage of white. The elf beside it with a steak knife. 

Not wanting Bella to see it in the morning, I rearranged the elf in the flour like a snow angel and went back to bed slightly shaken. I couldn't explain it. 

Over the course of December, I found that horrid thing doing unspeakable things to Bella's other toys. Barbie's stripped and hanging from ceiling fans. Her puppy teddy shaved of its fur. Books shredded and rearranged into a giant figure with a gaping hole in its chest like a wicker man. 

But on Christmas day, something  more terrifying happened. The pony arrived. A charred brown thing with larvae wiggling in cutaneous tissue along its neck. Hoofs broken and bleeding. 

Bella loved it unconditionally. We were horrified. Puzzled by the find, my wife and I returned inside to discuss what we could do. We found the elf up on the Christmas tree. A note in its blackened hands. 

*Dear Bella. Santa has forsaken you. But I didn't. I hope you like my infected pony. He will bring you to me. I have so many more devilish toys to show you. Satan.*

Cold dread crept up my spine as I raced outside. The pony was nowhere to be found. Fiery hoof print led away from the house and disappeared mid way. 

There's only one thing I want this Christmas. I want my child back."

Who are you?"" Everything turned black while the voice said ""You can not get away from the one who created this illusion, it is after all made by your own mind, now tell me , What do you fear the most?""

*Clinically* . . . I had to think clinically. And I had to move fast, had to take the knife and cut—yet I had to be careful not to cut too deep.

I had to shut everything down; I had to shut off the lights in all my rooms except the one where I would cut. *I had to ignore my pain . . . exit the moment . . . had to proceed*.

I took the knife and placed its blade on the belly, then I pressed and dragged—not too hard, but firm. The layers cut more easily than I’d imagined, and my incision was true. Still, *no time to waste* . . . *had to keep moving*. I pulled back the layers and reached deep into the belly. He was right there, *my child, my son* . . . I held him in my hands inside the belly, then I pulled him through the viscera, the muscle, the skin.

I held him in my arms, covered in blood as he was, eyes half opened staring at nothing. Of course he was dead, just as they’d said he’d be. *I held him . . . and I wailed . . . and wailed . . .*

*I hated* . . . I hated my husband for making us come to the Amazon with him, hated myself for not refusing to come. I hated that I’d looked away, even though it’d only been for the slightest of moments. And though the beast hadn’t acted out of malevolence as my heart told me it surely must’ve, but only out of its instinct to survive . . . I hated the anaconda, too. *My boy, my little James . . . he was just two . . .*"

The crust of the earth slowly broke apart, the ground violently shook. Our bodies came together scared and worried that the earth would swallow us up. The Trees brushing violently with the wind, in the distance strong sun rays shot through the sky. Leading us to our way out. We ran to the opening and stood there directly under the sunlight realizing that there was no way out. There we stood stranded in the sunlight for eternity waiting for the fog to disappear.  The fog swirled around us, there we stood looking at each other straight in the eyes realizing that we stuck with each other for the rest of our lifetime. She was the one."

How many times did he have to tell him to just leave the paper on the door step!? Everyday the idiot would ring the doorbell and wait for an answer. He’d stand there like a dummy and try to make small talk, he even had the nerve to ask if the old man needed help with anything. Last time he brought the paper, he’d really let him have it. The old man had screamed at him until the pansy had cried and ran away. Good riddance. The old man had let the screen door slap shut behind him. He turned around, caught his toe on the rug in the entryway, and had fallen. He’d spent hours trying to raise from the ground or crawl to the phone, but it was futile. So, he laid there, fallen.

Once he accepted his fate, he reminisced. It was ironic. His whole life had been a series of fallings. He had fallen in love, fallen from grace, he’d suffered falling outs, loved ones had fallen ill. Now, he’d fallen over the rug his late wife had fallen in love with. 
He’d hated it and thought it too expensive, but it’d made her happy, so he’d fallen for it. In fact he’d had an argument with his daughter a week prior about the damned thing. She’d suggested removing it so he wouldn’t trip over it. He accused her of trying to take one of the last things he had of value. The argument that proceeded had been explosive. She’d left sobbing as he yelled after her not to contact him again. She didn’t. So, he supposed this was all his fault, but wished it wasn’t so painful. He wished he could change things, but knew it was too late. He wished he wasn’t going to die alone. It scared him. 

He laid there for probably days. His mouth grew dry and his pain increased. Then he heard footsteps up his walkway. He used the last of his strength to twist his head towards the door. He saw the silhouette of the paperboy through the screen door. He reached towards the doorbell, but then stopped. The old man heard the thump of the newspaper on his front stoop and footsteps receding. He took a ragged breath and let the tears fall until he had fallen out of consciousness."

This time, he does not speak at the Strange Masters. Terrence has learned his lesson. Terrence isn’t the same as was before the Strange Masters came. 

Before, whenever Terrence had seen other masters pass his house, he would speak at them. “Go! Go! Go away! Go away! Go!” he would often say. Actually, Terrence *always* spoke when other masters were outside the house. 

But then his Master Jon would say, “It’s all right, Terrence! Be quiet, Terrence!” He loved Master Jon. Sometimes Terrence would listen to Master Jon, but it was hard. He just wanted his masters to be safe: Master Jon, Master Kate, and the two Little Masters. Terrence loved all his masters very much. 

They had lived together, happily, for a long time. Terrence protected them. He always let his masters know when something was different. If it wasn’t for Terrence speaking, more of the other masters would have come and bothered his masters, as they huddled around their light and noise boxes. 

But then the Strange Masters came. 

When Terrence told the Strange Masters to go away, they hadn’t listened. It was the opposite: when they heard Terrence, the Strange Masters began moving *toward* his voice. He spoke at them very much, saying loudly, “Go away! Go...go go go AWAY! Go!” 

But they kept coming. 

Terrence could tell there was something different about these masters. It was almost like they weren’t masters. They looked kind of like masters, but they made strange noises and smelled bad. They walked differently, almost like little masters. 

Master Jon and Master Kate had covered Terrence’s mouth to make him quiet. That had not happened to Terrence before. His masters were scared; the Little Masters were crying. The Strange Masters crashed through the door and windows. They were definitely not like his masters. 

They were hungry.

Terrified, Terrence hid under the bed when Master Jon got the bang stick. When he came back out, there was blood all over the ground. It was everywhere. There was no more Master Kate. There were no more Little Masters. Master Jon had stopped the Strange Masters, but he was hurt in his arm. His hurt smelled like the Strange Masters. 

Not long after the Strange Masters left, Master Jon became very sick. He has been in his bed. Terrence is quiet now; so is Master Jon. 

A sudden shuffling noise behind Terrence distracts him from the Strange Masters outside. It’s coming from Master Jon’s room! Terrence begins wagging his tail slowly, as he waits for his master. But something is wrong. Master Jon smells wrong. He sounds wrong. He smells and sounds like the Strange Masters now. 

Terrence growls, long and low. He hesitates, then speaks fiercely at Master Jon, “Go! Go away!” 

Master Jon doesn’t listen. He keeps coming. Outside, Terrence hears the Strange Masters begin their approach up the man-path..."

My younger sister Daphne tucked her feet in every night, terrified that something would drag her under if she left them uncovered. I starfished, fingers and toes fearlessly hanging over the edge. I knew that *I* had nothing to fear. Daphne tried to warn me, signing furiously that I would get stolen away by monsters, but I laughed her off and insisted there were no such dangers. We were both staying right here. She gave me the silently exaggerated angry face she always made when someone wasn’t taking her seriously, so I ruffled her pale hair and let the issue drop.

There was no monster for me under those beds. She was so convinced there was.

The first night I spent alone in my new college dorm, I slept without blankets, the remnants of the August heat pressing its palms against the glass of my window and homesickness sitting heavy in my stomach. The mattress was narrower than I was used to, and my entire forearm abandoned the constraints of the sheets and hung freely off the side of the bed. 

When I woke up, it wasn’t to my alarm clock.

Something feathery-light ran down my arm and I froze, startled out of my half-asleep muddle. The touch was gentle, soft, and utterly terrifying. I must’ve given some sign I was awake because it withdrew abruptly. Something was listening. I didn’t dare utter a sound. I tried to make myself breathe evenly, but the air was caught in my lungs. 

It knew I was awake. It took its barely substantial hand and pressed a letter into my palm. The signs my sister had taught me for years were replicated in the ghostly fingers under my bed, and I held my breath as I counted out the letters in my head. 

***LET***

It had only been a month since she left her old place after enduring two years of toxicity that masked itself as love. After all the hell, Kim had finally found heaven. 

Waitressing came as a salvation as she waited for callbacks from all the job interviews she had gone through. The owners of the family owned cafe were kind enough to give her a shot and even kinder as to cut her rent in half just until she could fully get back to her feet. 

The thought of that warmed Kim as she cantered the almost desolate street with her body begging for bed. Her eyes darted upwards and saw how even the moon was kind to her, its light beaming on her every step. 

A familiar ache of her feet prompted Kim to take the shortcut to her rented place and as she turned the corner to walk on a new path the sound of her phone dying filled her ears. 

Kim felt assured still as she saw another woman walking ahead of her, the clothing wasn't clear but the figure screamed feminine.

The longing for rest only got bigger as she saw the familiar windows of her home not far from where she stood.

The tranquility was finally broken when the woman suddenly threw something aside and sprinted away.  

A baby's cry echoed in the atmosphere as Kim ran towards it all the while yelling for the woman to stop, only for that person to run even faster. The little one was bundled in a white sheet, its tear-strickened face broke the girl's heart as she couldn't process just how cruelty could be done to something so innocent. 

As kindness clothed Kim when she needed it the most, she decided that it was time to give back with the intention of taking the baby home and then calling the authorities to report everything. 

It wasn't long before Kim felt a shift in the air, a shift that told her gut that something was clearly wrong. 

The baby got heavier and heavier and no matter how fast she walked, Kim wasn't advancing at all. A cry that broke her heart in the first place turned to one that made her stomach drop when it slowly started to sound into a demonic laugh. 

Kim didn't even dare to look down at what she was carrying, fear made her throw the thing aside as she ran and what made her run even faster was when she heard her own voice yelling at her to stop."

Should this news shock the upright and moral conscience of the goodly reader, let another truth be known:— their fascination has turned to sinful industry. Indeed, they are making smut as well!  

The present generation has donned the vestments of vice and left all else on the boudoir floor. They are, one and all, vainglorious purveyors of prurient exhibition, pimping their own meretricious malfeasance for the world to see. And the wages of their sin? A like, a click or an upvote—the accolade of the sex-addled peep show reprobate. 

Mired thusly in this sorry state of our declining societal virtue, I make my plea for common decency:

Cleanse this filth in the fire of the public square lest your children’s souls be soot-stained in the fires of hell. 

In a bygone era, one respecting and fearful of the outrage of God, men and women given to the devil’s grip were burned at the stake to rid the community of their infectious machinations. My call is not so rash as this, for we have learned from the barbarism of the past, our moral crop renewed from the ash of yesteryear. 

Ours is an epidemic spread among the gathered perusers of a media marketplace, a digital bordello of peddled flesh. To heal the body and indeed the soul, you need look no further than the words of Christ:

*And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.*

Christ knew of sacrifice, to be certain, the submission to destiny that paves a blood-dappled path to salvation. But He also knew of restraint. 

Were a wandering eye the root of our growing moral decay, we should have a clear solution. But in truth, the direction of His message is unmuddied by the soiled compass of our modern age. 

The parched hollow of the “thirst trap” offends. The critical mass of a million instagrams offends. The perfumed breeze of onlyfans offends. 

The flesh offends. 

Cut it away and cast it from the altar of temptation.

When I was 18 I had no choice but to join the family business which was killing, stealing and torturing. My father told me which body part of my body I would like to get chopped off and put into a fridge to stop it from decaying, this will be the only innocent piece of my body for years to come. Every member of my family has chopped off one of their arms and thier chopped off limbs is the ​only innocent part of their body. 

At first I couldn't decide whether to chop off my arm or a leg but in the end I decided to chop off my left arm and had gotten a sharp knife as a hook sort of thing to fit into my left arm as a replacement. After all of that I had murdered, stole and ruined so many people's lives in the name of the family business but after a hard days work, I would open up the fridge to look at my left arm which is still innocent and free of any sins.

I wished that I was as innocent as my left arm and clean of any filth and dirt. My left arm is a reminder of who I use to be and how happy I use to be when I didn't join the family business. You can even say that my left arm is still a virgin and how I wish that I could be like my left arm again. The atrocities that I put my whole body through and the things my body had to witness, my left arm is so lucky. 

The real reason my family chop off one of their limbs to be kept innocent when they go into the horrid sinful line of work, is because when hell decides to randomly take us to hell, heaven also randomly decides to take our innocent chopped off limbs to heaven. 

So we all hold onto our innocent limbs and then both heaven and hell can neither pull up or drag down either of us, and they give up. What if though I had two innocent chopped off limbs to hold onto, it will give heaven a more stronger pull. So I stole my cousin's chopped off arm and so when heaven and hell decide to act on us, I have two two chopped off innocent sinless limbs to hold onto. 

My cousin is freaking out."

Violence towards women, animals or anyone he deemed under him, he never saw the evil within it. At the height of his brutality, he murdered a Hells-Angels in cold blood during a drug deal gone bad. He served time for it, but he felt no remorse. That's what the world was to him, it's either you or them.

Reaching older age, he started worrying and wondered what the after life would hold for him, having lead such a life of violence, crime and brutality.

Suddenly, the idea of repentence seemed appealing. And so he opened up his arms to God. He poured out his sins, as to be forgiven. And so he felt clean, as if nothing more was standing in the way of his eternal peaceful life.

It's believed that our last judgement is based upon the character of our souls. We can, in our thoughts be forgiven, but can the soul truly forget the actions which were carried out at the hands of its vessel?

Lying on his death bed all alone, he was at peace knowing the Father had absolved him of his past sins. When the time came, a figure not of this world appeared to him. He was not frightened, as he knew this must be his end. 

""I guess you're here to bring me up to heaven aren't you? That's what you angels do right?"" he said almost jokingly. The being looked at him with a smile that was just a bit too big.

""Now see, that's the funny part about you humans, you always associate angels solely with heaven."" It spoke with a deep voice that didn't sound quite so divine.

He noticed, with panic slowly forming, that the being was steadily becoming more distorted with every passing second.

Out of the darkness where the face had just been, it spoke the words which sealed his fate. ""My friend, surely you've heard of my kind before? No? Why, there's quite a famous motorcycle gang named after us, ironic isn't it?""."

Nobody seemed to notice him except for me. He was clothed in white, and shone with an unearthly light. He had the most beautiful sky-blue eyes I had ever seen, a brilliant smile with pearly white teeth, and silky dove wings stretching out behind him.

“Hello, Isaac,” he sang. “I’m your guardian angel, Gabriel. Happy birthday!”

My jaw dropped. The angel winked at me. “Don’t worry. I’ll be here to guide you through your teenage years. We’ll be the best of friends!”

And he was right. We did become the best of friends. For a deity from heaven, he surprisingly knew a lot about pop culture and the latest trends. We spent hours late at night, chatting away. I would tell him about my day, and he would listen soulfully and respond with advice.

One day he showed me a vision of me dead on the floor, my parents standing around with knives and sadistic smiles on their faces.

“I know the future,” he said. “Trust me.”

However, my hands were shaking, my face deathly pale, as I executed Gabriel’s plan. I got the smallest knife I found and sneaked up to my parent’s room and slit their throat. Warm blood trickled downwards and stained everything crimson.

I got off scot-free thanks to Gabriel, who must have used his powers to clean everything up. But guilt wore down heavily on me like I was carrying all the sins of the world. I couldn’t sleep; I couldn’t eat. I tried seeing people for my problems. I tried to settle down with somebody to love, but every time a few months later, Gabriel would convince me, with visions as proof, that there was something wrong with them.

It was no surprise then that I died, alone and lonely, on a cold winter’s day, without anybody to remember me. I woke up though, in a room where fire and wild shadows were dancing on the wall. Mom and Dad and everybody else I once loved and killed stared back at me, anger haunting their faces.

Then a voice from the heavens boomed, “For every sin and murder you committed, it would be repaid twice as heavily to you.”

“I was trying to protect myself!” I sobbed. “My guardian angel, Gabriel, said I would die if I don’t!”

“Guardian angel? Gabriel?” said the voice blankly. “What are you talking about?”

Realization dawned upon me. As the horde of victims stormed towards me, hands reaching out for my throat, the shadows parted and Gabriel’s face appeared on the wall.

He cracked a sinister, victorious smile."

""Father... I have a bad feeling. Have you heard what peole in the village say?"" he asked nervously.

""There's no need to worry. Those are just rumors. This family is not evil."" Deacon replied abruptly.

Suddenly, the door opened, and the butler let them in.

Mister Dunning was waiting for them on the second floor. He greeted the pair gloomily and pointed at the door near the stairs.

""This is Christian's room. He's inside, tied up..."" he choked. ""...Tied up to the bed"".

Santos opened the door, and suddenly a jet of blood almost kicked him off his feet.

Something resembling Christian - a 15-year-old boy, was sitting on the bed, restrained by lots of thick ropes. The creature was smiling, baring its hideous, rotten teeth. Yellow scleras with missing pupils shone bright in the mostly dark room. A little string of blood was flowing down on bedsheets - the monster indeed was preparing to erupt another fountain of blood from its mouth. Santos squealed.

""In the name of Mistress Goria, I conjure you to leave her slave's body and go back where you came from!"" Deacon Zannic took out a cross-shaped dart and pinned the creature to the bed with a strong throw.

The creature screamed. Deacon Zannic signaled, and Santos rushed to the bed with a syringe. He firmly held the arm of the screaming creature and injected a brew in its vein. Then both Zannic and Santos murmured a spell, and the beast went silent.

In a moment, it screamed even louder than before. Walls shook, and the window glass shivered. The creature started banging its limbs against the bed, and suddenly the room became dark and silent.

Soon, the room lit up again, and Deacon Zannic and Santos saw a young boy lying on the bed. He looked shocked - his eyes were moving from Deacon Zannic to Santos, from Santos to... the figure standing next to the window.

It was tall, covered in fur, with red skin and huge fangs sticking out of its mouth. Two crooked horns were topping its bald head. Yellow eyes were full of terror and tears.

""Thank you, Father!.."" the creature cried. ""It was horrible! I thought I'd never make out of this nightmare alive..."". It pointed at the boy.

""Don't worry, it's over now, child,"" said Deacon Zannic softly. ""Mister Dunning! Please come in!""

The man who greeted the exorcists rushed into the room. Two horns ornated his head.

""Christian! I'm so glad you're safe!"" he hugged the red creature. ""Guards! Take that trash to the basement and make sure it suffers!""

Two men dragged the screaming boy from the bed and took him out.

""I told you, Santos,"" said Deacon Zannic calmly. ""You shouldn't trust rumors. This family wasn't evil. Just possessed.""

It was a hot sunny beach day, and the flock of seagulls circled the crowded shoreline lazily, waiting for the drowning child to die. 

The mother was lying on the beach, collapsed back from summer malaise and heat exhaustion. There was a lifeguard too, but the beach as crowded as one could expect a bright August day to be, and there was no way he could see one child growing increasingly still amongst the splashy hoard. 

The waves were not as gentle as they appeared, as the seagulls knew well. They circled closer, hoping the treacherous waves would pull the body in further, before anyone noticed, leaving it for them to munch on. A child’s body was a veritable feast, a welcome relief from the dull crusty leftover picnic offerings. Fish had become increasingly scarce in these waters and the need for meaty protein was intense. 

A couple of seagulls broke ranks, swooping down quite low, impatient and hungry. 

The others broke into loud angry whoops. They needed no one to spot the child until the waves had pulled it out much further. Any earlier, and the humans would run and scream and worse, pull out the body, leaving nothing for them. 

The child made a desperate attempt to pull itself up from the waves, and for a moment its distorted face emerged from the water, gasping. His little legs had lost contact with the ground a while ago, and he was scrabbling for his last breaths. He felt the heat of the sun and the salty water filling his mouth and lungs and he saw the flying seagulls around him so close their feathers brushed his face before he sank back under.

The seagulls acted in unison, swooping, crying out and flying low amongst the splashers, deflecting attention from the child in its final throes.

The lifeguard idly noticed the low-flying seagulls, but the swell of the water and sand hid the struggling child from his view. Everything seemed to be as it should be. The mother thought she would give herself another two minutes with eyes closed before hauling herself up and screaming her kid’s name. 

The child was quite still now and the waves were pulling it in further away from the shore very fast. In two minutes, it would be completely irrecoverable, out of the reach of even the most skilled lifeguard. 

The seagulls were now forming a kind of barrier between the floating body and the other bathers, who were instinctively moving away from the beaky platoon. 

The child wasn’t completely dead yet when the seagull unable wait any longer, dived in for the first bite. 

The mother reluctantly pushed herself up and began scanning the water."

Maybe I can hide here in my room. Maybe it will all be ok. The footsteps continue up the stairs and I realize that's not going to happen.

I lay lifeless staring back gripped in terror. She says nothing and turns her attention to the vanity in the corner of the room. The woman sits down and stares into the mirror. She reaches a dirty hand toward my brush and begins yanking it through her matted hair. It's the same color as mine. The same length too. She finishes and looks back at me smiling.

Someone's in my clothes. She’s traded her mud-covered boots for my sneakers. She’s helped herself to my perfume and the makeup laid out by the mirror. She no longer looks horrible as she glances into the vanity mirror. She looks like me. Almost identical. The phone on my desk rings and she answers it. She begins speaking. Raspy at first but then clearer and softer. Eventually mimicking me perfectly. ""Yes mom. I'll be over in about an hour. Love you too.” quickly ending the call before I can manage a cry for help.

There's Someone in my closet but no one knows it’s me. They don’t even know I’m gone. She tricked them all. I’ve tried screaming for help but no one can hear me. Of course they can’t hear me. It's too late. I’ve been dead for days."

You would think the world ending would be enough devastation. You're wrong. The end of the world wasn't the worst part. Trust me. I know. 


The news reports said it was an asteroid. The impact wasn't colossal, but enough to flatten Disneyland and the surrounding areas. 

Russia stated that a nuclear meltdown caused widespread panic. 

When a cloud of purple fog engulfed London, England, they shrugged it off as only the English could, spreading the 'keep calm, have a cuppa' propaganda. 

But, the Australian knew what it was when the first of the sandgropers ate a man in broad daylight. 

The world went into panic. Towns became hunting grounds for the infected. We didn't know what to call them. Zombies were too real, and plus they were still alive. Kinda of. 


My wife and I fought the craziness to rescue her mother. A perpetually snarky woman I absolutely hate. Two days into having her at my warehouse, (zombie fortified) I was ready to walk out and join them. 


Day three, the daft old bitch opened the door to a man screaming to be saved. She cost me my wife and my daughter. My daughter was at her side when she opened the door. My wife ran to rescue her stupid bitch of a mother. The man snatched my daughter right out the door and began to rip her throat out with his teeth. My wife tried to save her as I raced to them with my gun, but she became a victim too. 


I shot the bloke, and my wife and daughter too. I couldn't bear to see them like that. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, I didn't kill. Not yet. Even though she won't shut the fuck up! 

She bangs on about how shitty I am. How it's my fault! Can you believe it?


It's just a repeat of what she was thinking before she turned. They can't speak. Not really. More like a recorder stuck on loop. I would pull out her tongue, but I don't want to go near those teeth. She's one hungry son of a bitch.


She groans and snarls from the chains. 


*You're not good enough for my daughter*


*You let her down constantly. You big oof!*


I wish she would shut the fuck up!  The broken leg I gave her yesterday doesn't seem to faze her. The bone sticks out the side. She grins and snaps her teeth at me as I bend down to look into those evil eyes. I hope the bitch is in there, watching me break her piece by piece. 


Tonight I'm going to snap the other leg. Tomorrow maybe her arm. I'm not sure how long I'll survive. But yeah, the apocalypse sucks, but having a zombie mother-in-law? At least I get to have a little fun."

I’d always assumed that stars appeared dimmer when it was a full moon, but lying here on the patchwork blanket, I realized I may just have been wrong. It was like they were shining brighter tonight, just for me. 

I never realised how soothing the sound of a still lake could be either. Much louder than I remember. I swear I could hear the water breaking onto the beach as if I were lying next to the ocean. The noise complimented the distant hooting of the owls and the weird squeaky barks of the fox – like nature’s very own symphonic orchestra. I can’t believe that I only just learnt a few months ago that’s what foxes sound like, I laughed quietly to myself. And the scents... the luscious scents of nature... the pine trees, the wildflowers... hell, even the damp shingly sand smelled divine. I’d never given them much notice in the past. There was always tomorrow to slow down and smell the flowers. Unfortunately tomorrow never comes. I couldn’t help but smile to myself as I realised today was that tomorrow I always was promising myself.

I closed my eyes to absorb all of the stimulating scents and sounds of the peaceful world around me. As I opened my eyes I swear I saw a shooting star. I made a wish, but I doubt that wish could come true now.

“You look so beautiful right now. Almost serene.” He whispered, stroking a strand of damp hair from my face. I looked into his eyes. They seemed softer now. I smiled. His eyes lit up. He thought I was smiling for him. I wasn’t. That smile was for me and for being able to be so alive for the first time in my 28 years on this earth. It’s just  a shame it took this for me to notice the beauty that surrounds us every day.

As I reached my hand to my stomach, I could feel the deep gash, exposing my intestines and I realised at that moment that death was near.

Isn’t it funny that this is the first time I’ve felt so alive, so appreciative of the world around me, so conscious of my surroundings whilst only moments from death? 

I just wished I had been this alive earlier tonight, instead of dampening my flame with cheap vodka. I wish that I had allowed my senses to grow all these years, instead of suppressing them to get through my busy life, to numb out the world. I wish I’d have been able to have been so conscious of my surroundings, never fought against my gut feeling to the point it left me, leaving me with no survival instinct. Because maybe, just maybe I wouldn’t have left the bar with this handsome stranger tonight."

My partner was adopted. When we met he never talked about his past, but I got the feeling it bothered him not knowing anything about his birth family (he was adopted young).


By now, we’ve been married 13 years. We’re raising four (!) children. And even though he may not know much about his past, he tells me he can see into his future through our kids. 

Anyway, the AITA. I decided to do a DNA test for his birthday.

He just so happens to sleep with his mouth open and he’s a *really* deep sleeper, so it was easy to swab and get a sample. I know people typically just gift the kit, but he is a procrastinator and I wanted him to be able to see them without going through the anxious waiting game. 


When he opened his gift, instead of the surprise and excitement I expected, he got really mad. He started screaming “what did you do, why, what the fuck”. After he threw the box into the wall he locked himself in our room and didn’t speak to me for three days.


After he calmed down he asked if we could talk.

He told me I had no right to invade his background like that. Honestly, after hearing it out I see how I crossed a line. I apologized and he thankfully forgave me. 


But earlier the police were at our door asking if they could come inside. Asking about a DNA test. Just a few questions. 


But now he won’t speak to me again. So, AITA?"

r6wi05,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r6wi05/the_woman_at_the_end_of_the_hall/,The Woman at the End of the Hall,81,3,1638412546.0,"She stands at the end of the hall, with her arms to her side. She doesn’t make a single sound, her soft blue eyes stay straight ahead, almost as if they’re looking through you. More often than not she appears to be almost life like, with long blonde curls, ruby red lips, and porcelain skin. A pretty floral knee length dress forms her delicate young figure, with shiny black heals to match. Her body doesn’t move, it stands rigid, locked in place, until she fades into nothing. Though her face remains expressionless, her presence reeks of pure sadness. 

Other times, if you’re unlucky enough, you’ll get to catch a glimpse of the poor woman in a rotten  state. With matted hair, smeared makeup, dirty blood stained clothes, and a swollen scratch mark across her face. I guess one of the most unsettling things about her in this form is the bullet hole that goes clean through the eye socket. Whatever happened to the girl, it’s clear she didn’t go down without a fight. However, even while tears stream down her cheeks, she continues to be silent, and stiff. 

No one knows who the mysterious lady is, or why someone would have committed such a heinous act. The clothing suggests that her spirit has lingered there for well over 70 years, and I’m sure the house has changed hands many times since she succumbed to her fate. The person who hurt her probably passed long ago, leaving her to suffer in agony, standing at the end of the hall."

It was beyond refreshing to not be stuck in for a night and get some fresh air. I could feel the cool, crisp breeze touch my face and felt such tranquility at the silence and the ability to be alone in my thoughts; I was never more at ease. The stress of my day to day life seemed to not exist anymore, and I felt like the true version of myself. Halfway through my walk, it started to seem like something was pulling me in a certain direction, similar to a magnet catching metal, and my mind became overtaken by what I saw ahead of me. My thoughts whirled around in my mind like a rollercoaster. Gorgeous. That is the only thing that I can say. The bright and sparkling moon shining on the picturesque sight in front me; I was overwhelmed and infatuated. I wanted nothing more than to just stare, but I knew standing here would make it go farther away. So, I kept myself walking and walking. At one point, it seemed as if the beautiful thing in front of me seemed to get so far away I was losing sight, so I picked up my pace. Soon enough, I found myself running. I could not stop, and felt devastation running through my entire body as the figure began to disappear. I felt the sheer level of panic knowing I may never see her again. But it’s okay, though. I’ve found my way into her room, and am getting myself closer and closer to her, so one day I will get to be with the beautiful figure I saw that night."

It prevents us from starving but doesn't satisfy the anguish of hunger. We've been attached to these poles, naked, for at least 1000 years now. 1000 years of shit piles up next to us. 1000 years of wondering why they were doing this to us.

 --

We each had our own pole with a 3 foot metal chain attached to our neck. Every person had 5 feet of space separating them from another person. Below the thick clouds which raced hectically across the crimson red sky was nothing but metal poles and helpless humans. All you heard around you was an endless orchestra of cries in hundreds of languages. 10 billion poles and 10 billion cries from every direction.

 --

I can still remember when they first invaded Earth. Before they arrived we were already defeated. They cast a spell on the whole population which prevented us from sleeping. It only took 3 days for people to start losing their mind. After a month, everyone was a walking dead husk. They arrived 6 months later. No one had the energy to fight back. They forced everyone onto a ship and brought us to our new home.

 --

It was impossible to kill yourself here. I tried to rip apart my neck, empty my insides, smash my face against the ground. The metal arm would repair your body instantly. There was no escape from this nightmare.

 --

The 10 - 20 people around your pole were at first the only thing keeping you from losing complete hope. With what little energy we had, we would talk about our lives back on Earth. The lack of sleep would gradually deteriorate our minds further than we already imagined though. People around you slowly lost all hope. It only took about a year before conversation no longer existed. Every waking hour of the day was now spent screaming or crying.

 --

For the first time in 1000 years I was beginning to feel tired. All around me people started to collapse to the ground. It looked like hundreds of standing dominos falling on each other. Finally rest! My eyes were rapidly losing strength. Maybe I'd wake up and this nightmare would be over. Maybe I'd never wake up again. I was hoping for the latter.

 --

I woke up. The nightmare would continue. We were all relocated to a new planet. There were different people around me. But not just people. Another type of helpless looking being. More poles for another defeated planet."

Down the hall, the radio is blaring, masking my sobbing.

*""Stars shining bright above you, Night breezes seem to whisper I love you""*

I hear it again. It's dragging someone down the hall. The sounds of his nails against the hard concrete floor as he struggles against an unstoppable force are like that of a knife on a plate.

*""Birds singing in the sycamore tree""*

A sickening crunch ends the sound of terror. You could almost smell his fear before the crunch. And it could certainly smell mine.

*""Dream a little dream of me""*

The radio drones on as more crunches happen, sometimes quiet, sometimes loud. I can make out the sound of sickly chewing.

*""Say 'Nightie-night' and kiss me, just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me, while I'm alone and blue as can be*

*Dream a little dream of me""*

The radio is knocked off its table and smashes on the ground. I'm left with only the sound of my own sobbing and claws scraping the concrete, getting closer.

and suddenly the room isn't so dark anymore."

We opened at 8am so I was there at 7:30 to prepare for the day. I noticed that my co-worker Brand was already there because I saw his car outside, so I knew the back was open, i just headed straight there and strolled on in. I passed Brand who was knelt over by the counter shuffling stuff around. Said my usual morning greeting of ""wassup"" which was met with a mumble that I think said ""nothing"". 

I walked to the front of our store to turn our sign on and clean up the front door area. Brand moved to the other side of the counter as I worked so his back was to me. I asked him ""how was your night? Do anything fun?"" What followed sent me into a state of panic. He responded with ""Not much, just slept"". Only it didn't sound like Brand. And the voice they were using was so soft and light, nearly emotionless too. I turned to look at him and saw someone staring at me, wearing a crude mask of Brand's face. My entire stomach dropped and I couldn't even blink. I got so lightheaded I was afraid I would pass out. The mask must've been latex but I could still sort of see his eyes. Whoever this was was taller and broader than Brand. He moved left to right like he was trying to fake me out which way he was gonna go but couldn't even decide himself. He started giggling way under his breath, almost just exhaling through his nose.

 I backed up, pushed out the front door and ran faster than I thought I could, making it to the next store over where a girl and guy cashier helped me call the police. Long story short the guy was gone when the cops showed up and I just found out Brand's house shows signs of a ""break in"" but no sign of him or his family. Am I still in danger? The cops said they cant do much for me. What do I do? "

While it was painful, I managed to make it back to my car and go to the emergency room. My testicles were inflamed, but they treated that with some steroid that I can’t pronounce. 


So I went home, laughed about the situation, and moved on. 


But after two weeks, I had to go back to the ER. My balls were swollen again, red hot and painful. 


They tested my urine, and just to be safe, they had me provide a sperm sample, in order to make sure it wouldn’t become sterile due to an allergic reaction. 


When the doctor came back, he had a very concerned look on his face. 


“Your sperm are fine, the number is a little low, but they’re all still swimming.” He said. 


“So...what's the problem? Just a delayed reaction?” I asked.


“Well, when the lab looked at the slide they made, they found some...irregularities.” 


I felt a shiver run up my spine. “What does that mean? Be straight with me.”


He sighed. “They found miniscule little lumps surrounding the cells, they’re sending them in for further testing, but it may take a day or two to have the answers we need. For now, we’d like to admit you, and keep you under observation.” 


I almost disagreed, but, as we all know, men can be a little fearful when it comes to their gonads. I agreed, they set me up in a room, ran some blood tests, and told me to wait. 


I didn’t have to wait long. The more time passed, the more inflamed my testicles got, to the point where the pressure was unbearable.  


And then suddenly, it happened. White hot pain erupted from my crotch as my testicles burst, the pressure becoming too much to take. The nurse rushed in as I screamed, and then immediately joined my terrified cries when she saw what had burst. 


Well, we found out what the little lumps were. Not cancer, not a weird immune response. 


Thousands of tiny little spiders crawled across my bed, having finally hatched from their warm incubator.


The last thing I remember before passing out was the nurse screaming for the doctor to get there as soon as possible.   "

It blisters skin in Its wake, causing flesh to peel and slough off like a perverted winter wonderland. It takes away the very water necessary for the survival of all things and even so does all this and more without remorse. Without pity or concern. Without so much as a backward glance at the destruction it leaves behind. 

No one can agree on where it came from, only that there was a quiet peace before it birthed itself from the void. Wherever such a thing came from I can only hope to never visit. 

Sure, there are creams that can less the radiation but even the slightest exposure can leave a body... altered. Coverings, mechanical assistances, mere trivialities in the face of such an adversary. 

We have mastered this world in so many ways. Diseases that once brought us to our knees are barely a hinderance, injuries that would have left us lame before are healed swiftly, and the physics of reality now understood enough to work to our benefit rather than detriment. How I dream of the wonders we could create, the paradise we would inhabit, if not for this vile agony.

Our lives have been spent in fear of this great harbinger of pain, dutifully trying to rid our home of the growths that spring up when it ravages the very earth we once lovingly felt shift through our toes. Those late-night walks with loved ones are so few and far between now, even the sky is littered with spots, wounds, from that residual sickness.

During the day we huddle together, rarely in any large number or with any prolonged reprieve. With these limitations it has taken us so long, but we have planned. There will be an end to this tortured existence of constantly hiding, cowering, there has to be. There will be. 

My family was lucky, the largest pocket of us to survive unhindered for so long and only by burying ourselves deep underground. Alone we were able to venture out to others by taking refuge under the beds of beasts and in the deepest parts of the wilderness all to reach the others with our plan. Our roadmap to salvation. 

I have never been more terrified than that first sprint away from home, hoping that the fates were kind and would let me breathe just long enough to spread the word. This is my hundredth trip, and I wish I could say I’ve gotten braver, but I feel that perhaps I have just gotten numb. If I’m being honest, I don’t know if I ever thought this day would truly come.

Yet, here it is, I can see it. I watch from the safety of the darkness as the light fades away. No more sunlight. No more stars. No more terror. We are free."

They are the ones who watch us sleep.

They are the voice in the back of our heads.

They are why we evolved to run.

They are why we had to be smart.

But they are smarter.

This is where the shadows went.

The above is an old poem that got passed around my little town in the middle of the Canadian countryside. I first heard of it when I was only seven, all the way back in 1982.

Now, I was more mature than your average seven year old. I didn't believe in the took fairy or Santa clause or the Easter bunny and I wasn't spooked by scary movies or ghost stories, but...I could tell that this has a truth to it. And my fears were not eased by the fact that... well... people went missing, actually you could tell that people were going to disappear because it happened two at a time, every five years.

Around halfway through October, every half decade, one random boy and one random girl's shadow would disappear and the people in question would both disappear within the twenty-four hours of Halloween... God I remember one horrible, but actually quite peaceful disappearance about twenty years ago when a married couple's shadows both disappeared. From what I hear they cuddled up together under their warm blanket and... peacefully drifted off together, at least... that's what I'd like to believe because...

well...

Last week my shadow disappeared. I never thought it would have happened to me, there are over five thousand people in this town. I mean WHAT are the chances that it would have happened to me.

Anyway, I am exceedingly scared, not just because I am going to disappear, but because I don't know where I am going to end up... or if I really will just... vanish and I have been recently hearing a new poem.

Over and over.

In the walls:

We are the reason you are scared of the dark.

We are the ones who watch you sleep.

We are the voice in the back of your head.

We are why you evolved to run.

We are why you had to be smart.

But we are smarter

The man breathed heavily, trying to calm his beating heart. His knife, slick with blood, fell from his fingers. He knelt in the dirt, head hanging. It was the hardest thing he ever had to do. Some would have called him insane.

But he was a man of faith. He did as his god commanded. He could do no less.

His son had a faith even stronger and purer than his. His son did not even flinch when the man told him of god's will. He obeyed his father's words, out of love for his father, and for his god.

Even as the knife opened his throat and his life's blood poured out, staining the stone altar red, he did not cry out, but merely closed his eyes.

""Lord, hear me,"" the man said. ""The sacrifice is done. I have carried out your divine will.""

Silence reigned. Then the voice spoke again in his ear. Only somehow, it had changed. It sounded self-satisfied. Almost mocking. As if holding back a great gale of laughter.

The spice of the ginger burned my mouth and throat; the sweet and tangy notes of those cookies made my mouth water.

It was only after I had eaten several of them that I realized the burning was from something far worse. Pain raced through my whole body, and blood spurted out of my mouth. 

I don't remember much else. 

Those sugar crystals sure were shiny though."

Bella never cried for her sadness, however. She simply suffered in silence, with a phony smile plastered on her face. The reason for this act was of course, fear. Fear that those who loved her wouldn’t like the reason for her sadness and would simply dismiss it with a waved hand and a half-baked excuse. So she smiled. Every day Bella smiled. Every day, hollow, deceiving smiles.

One day, while she was at school, Bella noticed an unnerving figure looming outside her classroom window. It was about 7 feet tall and had long, gangly limbs, its knuckles dragging on the floor. Its body looked starved and its skin was a pale sickly grey. Coming up to its face, it had no ears, only small holes where ones would go. The thing had small, beady black eyes with gross, dark, purplish bags underneath. It had a wide, crooked nose which pointed down towards its smile, the most dreadful feature. The smile took up 3/4ths of its face with its yellowish grinding teeth, chapped lips and drool running down what semblance of a chin it had. Suddenly, just as soon as it appeared, it had gone. Bella thought herself crazy. The bell rang and she went about her day but, it followed her. In gym, it sat tauntingly in the bleachers, **smiling**. At lunch, in the table just across from her, **smiling**. On the bus, **SMILING!** It was getting closer, bolder and only she could see it there just… just…

**JUST SMILING!**

As soon as she got home, she locked all of the doors, the windows, and every conceivable entrance. She locked herself in the bathroom, for it had no windows and decided she’d stay there till her parents arrived. 

When her parents got home, they called her name to no response. They searched the house, finding that the bathroom door was locked. They called her name again, still no answer. After a few more tries, they unlocked the door.

Said my best friend, Sarah, and placed the cup perfectly in the centre of the coaster. ""And please don't spill the sugar this time."" She shot me a look of condescension before joining me at her kitchen-table.

""That was an accident and you know it."" I replied.

""Hmm."" She sipped her drink and looked down at the table. I guess over the years I'd just gotten used to her rudeness, not just because we share the same condition and understand eachother, but because she has been there for me when no one else has. She's my best friend, quite possibly my only friend, and I will always make the time for her.

""So, what's going on?"" I asked, ignoring her remark. ""You seemed extremely upset on the phone?""

""Kyle got sent home from school with a letter.""

""Oh? What did it say?""

""It said, if I do not to take him to the doctors for his skin, then they are going to report me. Can you believe that?!...Me?! You know I love Kyle with all my heart! I would never let him have a skin-rash or anything! I make sure he scrubs his hands all the time and he most definitely has a bath or shower twice a day...Besides, I've checked him...There's no rash whatsoever. I mean, I made him have a bath anyway, but there was no rash!""

""Well, perhaps they're just worried it might be something-else?""

""Oh come off it, Becca, you know they don't like me and are just trying to push my buttons again...You know it's not the first-time.""

""I'm just trying to point out that-""

""Don't believe me? Go check Kyle out for yourself. Go on...Check him. He's in his bedroom.""

I actually needed the toilet, so I decided to oblige and headed upstairs.

After using the bathroom, I thoroughly washed my hands and proceeded to Kyle's room. His door was shut like always. I knocked three-times and waited for his command.

""Yeah.""

""Hi Kyle, it's Becca!"" Kyle was laying in his bed with the duvet pulled-up, covering everything but his head. He didn't reply. He just closed his eyes and looked away. It was almost as if he didn't want me there. I slowly walked over to his bed. ""Mind if I take a look?"" I asked. Again, he said nothing.

I whipped back the covers to reveal his raw, peeling skin. Pulsating blisters and oozing sores stared back at me. Blood slowly wept from his pores and dripped onto the bed. I swiftly looked over his entire body. It was the same everywhere. His head was still facing away from me and his eyes were still closed. I returned the covers and ran back downstairs to the kitchen.

""Wellll...?"" Asked Sarah.

""Wellll, you're right...He definitely doesn't have a rash. But, did you know he's bleeding all over the mattress?!"" I proclaimed.

""Yes I do know! It's driving me mad! Do you know the best way to get it out?"""

I think it’s fair to say that whilst some have been blessed with a greater treasure than others, the most unfortunate amongst us would consider certain memories more of a curse. 

That’s why I started an organisation called Muninn, alongside my business partner, Hugh. Using the latest technology, dubbed ‘Loftus’, we can have full control over a client’s memories. 

You can imagine the possibilities. Not only can we delete traumatic memories, we can also add in new ones; anything from a big achievement, to a passionate romance, to a nice holiday. 

Things were going great until a few weeks back, when we received a visit from the police. They had found a lead in a case involving the notorious ‘masked killer’ as the papers called him. For once he had slipped up and left behind some evidence; a patented gas we use to knock clients out before the procedure. This evidence, of course, led them directly to our lab. 

Now, we have a fairly small, tight knit team. It’s fair to say this shook the place up quite a bit, given the strong possibility someone here could be the killer. What I and others couldn’t help but notice was the response of Hugh, who began to act somewhat strangely. 

As if this wasn’t enough of a bombshell, more evidence soon came forward. A victim who not only managed to survive, but who also tore the mask off the perpetrator before fleeing. I dropped my jaw in disbelief as it was confirmed that I matched the profile of the killer. Not only that, the victim had wrestled the gas canister before it could be used on him, which it turned out was covered in my fingerprints. 

I protested in vain as I was brought in for questioning. Surely they couldn’t convict on such a flimsy case, given we’re in the business of false memories? In the end, it appeared that luck was on my side. On the night this incident supposedly happened, I had irrefutable evidence of being out of the country. The memory was, therefore, ruled to be false.

Attention then turned to Hugh, the only other person with the access and knowhow to operate our system. Under the pressure, Hugh crumbled, admitting he had attempted to frame me. 

As Hugh was found guilty, I breathed a sigh of relief. How could I have been so careless to leave evidence behind? Good thing Hugh and the latest ‘victim’ didn’t think to doubt their own memories."

The fake Louis Vuitton bag hanging off her arm would fool most people but not me. Popping in her earbuds, she Unknowingly made his job easier. As she passed right by me, I nodded to the rest of the gang further down the street. 

We kept up with her, only a few steps behind her. Laura motioned to Hailey a few yards further down. As she passed, Hailey pushed the bins, disturbing a feral cat. The screech and banging startling her. She let out a loud sigh as the cat ran past. Pulling her jacket a bit tighter around her waist and carried on walking past the bus stop. Laura looked at me with a grim expression, shaking her head. Hailey shrugged, a look of disappointment on her face. Stepping in line behind us.

Further down we motioned to Effie, standing at the edge of the pavement, a slight girl, a similar stature to her. Next to her a homeless woman with a mutt. Now almost in line with her in preparation to cross the road, Effie kicked dog, angering it. The dog barked aggressively, scaring her; but she kept on, tried her best to stand straight and look confident, but we could see she was panicking. A taxi rank was coming up. If we could just... It was our last chance. As she crossed the road, Effie stroked the dog, apologising for kicking it and kissing its scruffy little head.

Her pace quickened, as did ours. She glanced behind her, for a moment I was certain she made eye contact with me, but that could have been wishful thinking. Rushing past the taxi rank we knew we’d lost. The street lights down this way were bust, she bustled on in the darkness her heart beating loudly, her breathing erratic.

He stepped out of the alleyway, the knife in his hand. We stopped, waiting for the inevitable. Hopefully she’d give her possessions up easily and the knife would just be used as a threat, but we knew from experience this rarely happened. She fought. She fought hard. Then she fell to the ground as he grabbed her things and ran, leaving her bleeding out in the street. We knelt down beside her waiting for her to see her. She tried to stop the bleeding, but as the final breath left her body, her eyes wide open, she finally saw us. 

“We tried to warn you Sarah, we tried. We’re so sorry” She looked at us, taking us in, her eyes falling on our stab wounds. It took a second for her to register. She was now, unfortunately, one of us. I reached out my hand and helped Sarah on her feet. She glanced down at her corpse. Sarah whispered “Maybe we can save the next one...”"

While I can’t say I particularly enjoy it, over time I’ve gotten used to the sleepless nights and hours of endless boredom alone in my room. Scrolling through apps on my phone can only take away the boredom for a little bit, and even then it’s not much. 

However, I came up with a little game that I wanted to share. You see, my family are very light sleepers, so much so that the slightest noise outside will wake them up. Many mornings of groggy grumbling have made me well aware of that fact. Sometimes after they’ve woken up they tend to walk downstairs, whether it’s to get something out of the fridge, or sneakily play video games in the dead of the night, is all up to speculation. 

They do this so often that I’m able to figure out who is moving around just by the sound of their footprints. And so, a game was born. I now pass the time by figuring out who is roaming around in the middle of the night. 

Tonight I’m playing that same game. 

It’s about 11:45 PM, the front door just opened. Good, dad must gotten home. Usually I can hear his car pull up on the driveway, but I guess he finally learned his lesson after mom angrily explained how his late-night excursions always woke her up.

12:30 AM. My brother’s door just opened and I can hear him descend the stairs down to the first floor. This wouldn’t be the first time he’s gotten up at this hour. Must have forgotten to do some assignment and is now rushing to get it done. 

2:00 AM. My brother still hasn’t come upstairs yet. 

2:30 AM. I heard a pair of footsteps slowly ascend the stairs up to the second floor. They were heavy and pressed hard against the floor. I’m guessing it’s dad coming to bed. They went right past my door and into my mom’s room. 

3:00 AM. I’ve never encountered a night where someone in my family sleepwalks, but I guess tonight is that night. The footsteps came back but between each step they dragged across the floor. And with each turn came a sort of bump or bang against a shelf or bookcase. On the way down the stairs it was as if they never lifted their feet at all. From what I’m guessing, it will be a hell of a story telling mom that she sleepwalked tonight. 

3:30 AM. She came back up the stairs. The footsteps stopped right outside my door. I think she saw the light of my phone from outside my room. I have to go now."

It was well past midnight before the inn finally appeared through the heavy fog, its lights giving off a faint but ghostly glare against the dark.

Thankfully, the innkeeper answered the door; mercifully, he still had a room. Even through my weary grief I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

I don’t know how long I slept, but I awakened to sunlight filtering through the flaws in the old curtains.

Merlin seemed unconcerned with the guns pointing at him. ""It's not cheap shit, it's *good* shit. At a great price. That's why it's not your market anymore.""

Drago did not like that at all. He aimed his pistol at Merlin's forehead. ""You're selling for less than I'm buying. Who the fuck is your supplier?""

Drago and his goons turned to stare at identical copies of themselves.

The reason for Drago's success was his ability to quickly recognize and fix problems. One house, one wife, but two Dragos… that was a big problem. He raised his pistol a moment quicker and fired.

The shootout didn't last long. At the end only Drago and Luis were standing. Was he the real Luis? If Merlin was telling the truth, then it didn't really matter. As long as there was only one.

He pointed a shaky pistol at Merlin, who started laughing.

She had learned since childhood to placate volatile personalities, to the extent that she barely had any personality of her own left. Like water, she assumed the shape of whatever vessel she was poured into. Almost.  

It took a few months for him to realise her fluidity, and he found himself probing its depth. How far would she go to keep him calm?

*-Babe Ive been working late tired 2nite. Sorry to cancel meet tomorrow?*

Had he sent this text to Gisele, his tempestuous ex, he would have spent a week grovelling to pay for it. Sylvia responded within minutes.

*-Np darling, I’m rly tired too zzz*

An hour later he texted *i luv u baby! I miss you so much sorry we didn’t get together. Wish i was in ur arms rn <3*

Her response came flying back: *Oh darling ily so much!!! I wish you were!!!* 

He called her, and they spent hours in passionate conversation. 

But did she mean it? Hamid wondered. Or was she simply reflecting his passion back to him, telling him what he wanted to hear? He fondly recalled Gisele’s forthright declarations of love and hate. He started mentioning her name, half-deliberately, mostly negatively. Sylvia responded with perfect equanimity each time. 

Sylvia’s placidity wasn’t just for love. She was hungry when he was hungry, happy to eat where he wanted to eat, ready to hang out when he was. One evening he burst out, “What the fuck do you want to do Sylvia? Are you actually fucking hungry? Tell me!”

She raised her arms to cover her head, then gave him such a confused look of wounded innocence that his gut wrenched. “I really don’t mind Hamid” she said softly. She pulled herself together “Why don’t we try the new Thai place, I heard it’s great!”   

His inner demon prompted him to say “Gisele loved Thai! Maybe we’ll run into her there!

She laughed “Maybe we will!” 

Hamid shook his head in frustration. Gisele would have eviscerated him for a comment like that. Then he saw Sylvia's eyes as she turned to get her jacket. Something made him think he’s getting through to her, the real her. There was a genuine expression there, one that he hadn’t seen before, in all these months.   

He woke up later that night, to an empty bed and the sound of the front door slamming. 

“Sylvia?” 

He switched on the light, terror flooding him.  

She walked into the bedroom, the stony look of early evening in her eyes.

“Sylvia- where were you?”

“It’s done. You wanted me to do it, right? ”

“What have you done?”

But he already knew. 

“Gisele. She’s dead. What you wanted.” It was a statement of fact. She sat on the bed, waiting for his next move."

I'm hoping that you know that hate is not the opposite of love, indifference is and my love for humans stems as deep as my hatred. I find them too perplexing to not disassemble because the entanglement within them is so interesting. I never really got other people until I had this opportunity do to so by becoming a detective. It was one of my last cases that I work which finally gave me the foresight to go through with my temptation.

It was like she was sent from any God that exists. The perfect choice. I asked her where the nearest gas station was and with a little bit of feigned ignorance I lured her into my car. Once she was inside, helping me with my map, I attacked. Perfectly planned and executed, like always. She screamed like all the others, but through that cacophony of sounds, I knew that this would finally matter. I took her to my place and did all the things that would make them interested. Fortunately her screams were blocked out by the noise-canceling padding. Because of my forethought, I knew they would never catch me in the act. 

“Why are you doing this,” she pleaded

“Because I can,” I retorted

“Please,” she cried, “I can’t leave my little girl alone”

*I wonder if my mother ever thought that about me. Did she put me before anyone else? Did she ever truly care? Maybe if she had told me this before I had killed her, she could be alive. In reality, I can’t imagine loving someone so much that they would become more important than your own life. Maybe I got that from my mother.*

“I knew you were special,” I said as I slit her throat and her essence spewed out.

I stood in awe of my own work. I had never realized it, but it's such a pretty color. To me, its mesmerizing nature had become so mundane. But with her, I could see all the hues as it spilled on the floor. A beautiful painting of crimson, burgundy, mahogany, and scarlet. It was nothing but a true expression of art. A genuine sacrifice for beauty.

As I threw her body into the river I thought of my nonsensical boss trying to solve this one. It’s laughable honestly. I knew what he was doing right then too because the phone I had hijacked from my victim started buzzing in my back pocket. He was calling his mistress. Little did he know, she was lying on the bottom of a river."

I remember it better than the constant barrage of artillery. I remember it better than the sporadic fire from many guns around me. I remember it better than the constant fear that cacophony of sounds brought.

And I do not remember it fondly, I got so used to those sounds. That looking back now, they even seemed comforting. Because I knew something was happening, I felt as if I had some sort of control, however small. That despite the chaos I could do something to prevent my demise, I could hear the gunfire and smell the gunpowder and those raging fires around, the fresh corpses of both friend and foe.

But that silence, that deafening silence. When the guns go silent, and when the only thing that can comfort me is the sound of my breath, I know that something much worse is afoot. I know that I cannot control my fate, and only a single bullet or shell, a piece of stray shrapnel is enough to end my life.

That in any moment, with little to no warning, everything around me is going to explode. And I couldn't do anything about it. 

I remember the silence, the claustrophobia in those small rooms and narrow corridors I went through. With each step, I knew that something is watching, biding It's time until the moment is right. The sound of my own footsteps would induce anxiety. I hate it, I hate the silence more than anything.

But I remember it better than anything else.

My quick breaths, my footsteps, the creaking of the floorboards beneath me. The sound of dirt, snow, and mud beneath my heel. The wind, the swaying of trees, and the slow crumbling of buildings. So many sounds yet there was dead silence. 

Why? Why is it carved into my brain so deeply? Why? Why was there no peace in that most serene of tranquility? Why can't I rest? Why can't I go in peace?

Why do I have to remember the silence?"

My bare feet scraping the bracken. Sheets of amber leaves grieved just for me. I had lost everything moments before. My parents. My husband. My children. My home. 


Deep I waded. Not paying attention to the direction of my fate but rather lost in a sea of hurt. Day turned to night, but my grief stayed with me, wrapped my sagging shoulder, lined my stomach. 


Soon, I was as lost as my heart. Hoots and growls prevaded the night. The cold numbed my toes and stole the breath from my lungs. Agony collapsed me to the forest floor in the shadow of a colossal tree. I prayed to any god that would listen to restore what had been taken. 


Fear shot through me as twigs snapped and the crunch of leaves echoed around me. From the trees stepped a figure of a lady. Cloven hooves for feet, hair of shimmering gold. 


""I will give back what was taken, but you will die one hundred days from now.""


Tears wet my cheeks as I agreed. I felt the lash and sting of a cut. Behind me growled a lone wolf. Eyes of yellow. Coat as black as coal. Teeth shining with blood.


He took me in his embrace. I felt warmth seeping through my tired bones. In my mind I heard him calling. Telling me to accept the gift and bestow it on those that I chose. 


Hours later, as the moon waned, I felt the tremors of the change. My back arched. Fangs grew. My body sprung fur. I howled with agony knowing that I would forever be changed. Forever be cursed until I die. But my lamentations vibrated with a new hope. One that would give my children a chance. 


My vision tunnelled as I sped back to my home. To the man that had changed and taken those that I loved. The house glowed with the soft light of candles. Shadows danced in the windows. I smelt his scent. His stench. 


The wooden door splinted. My claws ripping them to shreds. He stood by the fire, warming his cold hand. My children, my mother and father huddled together in a corner. Rage filled my veins as if on fire. I charged the vampire and decimated my husband as only a mother could. 


Frightened, but alive my family came to me as I called them in their minds. I parted the gift on them as it was bestowed on me. For it was a gift. One that would protect them when I was gone. 


Today is my hundredth day. I wade into the forest along with my pack to give back what had been giving for the strength I needed at the time I needed it. 


The cloven lady shimmers in the trees, smiling as I come to her. I know true terror for the first time. Terror for those I will leave behind. "

The drapes to one side of the room had been drawn already, blocking out all exterior light from passing cars and moth-sieged streetlights.

He knew it only took him two steps, from the door, to reach the edge of the bed. He also knew, for example, it took three steps to reach the edge of the bed, and bump his big toe against it.

&#x200B;

Without hesitation, without sight, he took two steps into that night eternal. Not feeling the edge of the bed yet, he took one more temptive step forward, and with that, became lost forever.

&#x200B;

The bed wasn't there.

&#x200B;

He took another measured step -four now- still expecting to hit something.

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

Another step.

&#x200B;

Five.

&#x200B;

Another.

&#x200B;

Another.

&#x200B;

Six, seven, eight.

&#x200B;

Nothing. The bed wasn't there. It simply wasn't there.

&#x200B;

No bed no nightstand no drapes no closet no wall-mounted bookshelves no phone chargers plugged into the wall no TV cabinet no framed photographs no potted plants, no nothing.

&#x200B;

All, nothing.

&#x200B;

Keenly aware of his lack of surroundings, Vernon took a step back, turning around to face where the door should be. With outstretched arms, he reached into the shadows, afraid of what wasn't in them, afraid of what might. Each step onward was a promise of reaching the door, and each step that followed was a breaking of that same promise.

&#x200B;

He turned around again, unsure of whether he was still facing the bed, or the door; maybe neither. Maybe there was no bed, no door. Just like there were no walls, no roof. No floor to feel under his feet. No sound in his ears. No smell in his nose. No taste in his mouth.

&#x200B;

Just darkness, all about him, undisturbed by his presence.

&#x200B;

This is annihilation of all that was.

&#x200B;

Absolute.

&#x200B;

 Undirected. 

&#x200B;

Ever-lasting.

&#x200B;

Lightlessness; nothingness.

&#x200B;

Blind, Vernon lunged into that gloom, even when there was nowhere to run to. He screamed at it, even when there was nothing to scream at; nothing to hear him scream. 

&#x200B;

Only darkness."

His first performance on *America's Got Talent* was legendary all on its own: walking on a tightrope that was slowly being burned away at both ends, 50 feet off the ground with no safety net.

He won the competition and got his own residency in Vegas, where he seemed to outdo himself every single night; swimming with man-eating sharks, having his blindfolded assistant shoot at him, being locked in a box with venomous snakes... everyone wanted to know the secret to how he was able to perform such terrifying acts.

But no one would have ever been able to guess the truth.

When he was just a boy, Theo received a prophetic vision. He was never able to figure out how or why he did, or how he knew it was a vision from the future, he just *knew*. It was brief and simple: Theo dying peacefully in his sleep as an old man.

From that day forward, he made a life out of doing the most dangerous things ever attempted, without any sense of hesitation or planning, because he knew he would make it out alive every time. Eventually, as crowds of people flocked to watch him perform, he acquired fame, wealth, and all the earthly pleasures he could have ever wished for.

After a few years in Vegas, Theo decided to up the ante. He planned a live television special wherin he would jump off the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle, with nothing below to stop his fall. The media went crazy, wondering how he planned on pulling it off. As usual, though, he had no plan, he just knew that everything would work out.

The time came, and with a huge crowd watching, he revved up the bike, turned around to wink at everyone, then sped off the edge of the canyon.

As he plummeted to the ground below, Theo closed his eyes and enjoyed the thrill of it all, trusting whatever powers that be to work their magic as they had many times before.

*CRRRAAAACCCKK!!!*

The pain of his neck snapping was the last conscious thing he ever felt. As he lay in a coma for the rest of his life before dying peacefully in his sleep as an old man, his story became a cautionary tale for all death defying stunt people."

My parents eventually had to soundproof my room as it was the only way they could live comfortably in the house. I sit in the room all day screaming in agony as my family pretend like I don't exist.

Also, I LOVE cooking. Today I'm going to make a homestyle lasagna for dinner. My husband and kids will have a blast, that's for sure. They definitely don't expect me to cook today, so it's going to be a surprise.

After doing some other chores, I tidied up the house, took a shower, and started preparing ingredients - all fresh from the market I visited this morning.

In just an hour, my kitchen is already full of delicious flavors. Meat and pasta are ready to go into an oven. I just need to cut up some veggies.

Here we go - fresh tomatoes and onions. Yum! I put on some music, got a knife, and started chopping the veggies singing along with Madonna.

_Chop-chop-chop!_

""…material world…""

_Chop-chop-chop!_

""…material girl…""

_Chop-chop…_

I stopped. Something is wrong. Music is not loud enough, and I can't see well… Why is everything so blurry?

Okay, I need to take a deep breath.

Here're the veggies and the cutting board. Here's the knife. What's that red? A tomato? But I haven't started cutting them yet. Is it?.. Oh.

Blood. Blood all over the cutting board. And a piece of my finger among the onion shreds.

No, no, no, please, not now. Not when I'm all alone in the house.

Why did I even start cooking? I'm not supposed to work with anything sharp when I'm alone! Because if I see the blood, I… I shouldn't think about it.

Okay. Don't panic, you can do that.

Oh my god, it's everywhere… And it's already getting hard to breathe. Why so soon?

A flash of pain suddenly struck my hand. Okay, it's real now. And the blood…

""Can anyone help me, please? Please?.."" I asked hoping for a response.

What am I thinking about? Nobody is here.

Okay, try to think. You need to wash it off. Here's the sink. Good, the water is warm and calming… Just don't look. Don't look at that reddish liquid drowning down the sink.

I take a breath and look down at my clothes. My apron is covered in blood. How did it get that bad so soon?

Suddenly, the sunlight disappeared. The kitchen has become dark and cold in a second.

Towel. I need to wrap my hand in it. But first, I need to remove the apron - the blood shouldn't be anywhere near me.

Oh my god, it's very hard to breathe now. I'm shivering, and my limbs are getting numb.

I close my eyes tight, take off the apron, and throw it away. Then I grab a towel.

It's getting colder.

Tears are running down my cheeks. Not enough air. Not enough time...

I might die from the shock asphyxiation at any moment... because I'm afraid of blood.

I'm so afraid of blood, Mommy..."

I felt cold and clammy, which made the barrage of smouldering wind which bellowed over me like that from a furnace; ever more disturbing. I jumped. My whole body shivered as a troubled hand molested my shoulder from behind. There was nobody there. I attempt to lift my head, nothing. Mustering all remaining strength, I strain the muscles of my neck with no success. It was as if I was chained to the floor. Was I? Even now I can’t recall. But I do remember a sudden sulphuric stench that filled the air, thick and chemical, it caressed the back of my throat like being force fed a feather. It was accompanied by an abrupt increase in temperature and a burning of the skin. As all of this happened I was too distracted by my unrestrainable coughing to notice the gloomy lifting of the fog, which had been hanging in the air since I woke. Whenever I came to I would notice the rusty iron gate that sat in the near distance. And the sign that hangs upon it. On which - inscribed in an unknown tongue - was declared: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”"

Six years ago, my husband gifted me a love-chair for Christmas. It was custom built to fit our bodies, which means we can’t resell it to recover some of the cost, and my husband is pissed about all the money we’d lose. That’s before we even talk about a replacement.

Whenever I bring up the subject he says a Swiss love-chair should last (at least) 15 years—which is usually true—but the problem is we use ours so much the damn thing’s already falling apart. The way I like to explain it is like a car: if you brought a new Mercedes and put 350,000 miles on it the first year, you wouldn’t be surprised if it needed to go into the shop once or twice.

Last time I broached the subject my husband blew up. He literally stormed into the cellar and made me lie down. Then he went on a rant about how the cushion was in the exact right position to support my diaphragm and the width between the handles perfectly matched his arm spam.

I said that wasn’t the problem. I reminded him how the last guy I found on Tinder slipped out of the strappado. Obviously both his shoulders were already dislocated but it was still super embarrassing trying to scramble for our clothes AND keep him from escaping.

The metal components are rusted as well. Two months ago, we used the thumbscrew, and it literally took all my strength to turn the crank far enough to make the girl I met at the coffee shop scream, and that sort of physical exertion is a real mood killer for me.

My husband says these are minor issues and swears he’ll repair the chair but never does. I appreciate he’s the primary breadwinner and is entitled to his opinion on how we manage our finances but it’s becoming a real sore spot in our relationship.

His birthday is coming up and he’s already hinted he wants to use the Judas cradle, but the spike doesn’t even match our rhythm anymore.

Does anyone know how I can convince him it’s worth spending the money on a replacement?"
r5ksds,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r5ksds/poker_with_the_devil/,Poker with the Devil,46,6,1638269732.0,"My friend Toby had always been the quirkiest one in the family because he was always gambling, but you cannot deny how good he was at it. Either that or he had the luck of the devil, especially at cards. He could bluff his way out of Texas Hold ‘Em and poker. He could count cards in his head at blackjack at the speed of lightning. And nine times out of ten, he would win, with both skill and sheer luck.
 
It was a Friday evening when it happened. We were in the den, drunk and high on both weed and whisky, playing cards. As usual, Toby was winning every round. He had a tower of chips by his side.
 
“Ha!” he boomed. “Am I lucky tonight, boys?”
 
We murmured in agreement.
 
“Why, I bet even the Devil can’t beat me tonight! Now who’s next?”
 
The moment he said *that*, I don’t know if it was by chance or what, but a little old gentleman walked into the den. 
 
“May I play?” He sounded nervous.
 
Toby’s smile widened as he gestured for the gentleman to sit down. They placed their bets--Toby betting double like he always did--and I dealt the cards.
 
Toby couldn’t stop smiling as he looked at his cards. The gentleman’s hand twitched. I don’t think he knew what he was up against.
 
The gentleman won easily.
 
Toby’s smile broke. His face turned red. “Again!”
 
And so they played. The gentleman was good though, if not better. Five-of-a-kind. Straight flushes. The chips piled up on his side, and soon Toby had no chips left.
 
The gentleman got up. “I’ll collect my reward soon, Toby,” he said, smiling gently. “See you then.”

***
We didn’t notice the change until much later.
 
Toby stopped going out with us. He stopped gambling, betting. Instead he lied on the couch, his eyes empty, drinking beer and watching Netflix. It was like a vampire had sucked all the energy out of him. We tried asking what was wrong with him, but when he didn’t respond, we gave up.
 
I later heard he died, without any money or anyone to remember him. He was already the black sheep of the family; and even his girlfriend left him when he wasn’t so exciting anymore. Everyone else had deserted him.
 
I was the only one who attended his funeral. It was a cold, wintry day, and I wrapped my coat tightly around myself. I bowed my head at his grave, thinking how Toby wasted his final moments away.
 
That was when I heard a sharp *ahem* behind me.
 
It was the little old gentleman, wearing his bowler hat. Unlike the other time, he was radiating confidence. He had with him a pack of cards.
 
“I can take you to see your friend if you’d like, Dylan,” he offered. 
 
“You just need to beat me in a game of your choice. Deal or no deal?”"

Your heart rate quickens and thumps in your chest for a few seconds before you fold up the memory and submerge it deep down in your mind, because you just can’t imagine how it would feel like if it happened to you. Well, it happened to me this day.

It’s a common one, honestly. One of those one in a million chances of disaster that you have no choice but to brush off to live your life. Planes crashing, brakes failing, choking. I did the same when I signed away that possibility on the waiver they presented to me. And as you can guess, the worst happened to me. I was that one in a million.

In the beginning, there was euphoria. Your body caught in a whirlwind, the hair whipping your face, the free and delightful laughter that escapes your throat. There’s a cold wind piercing your body as you tumble, and maybe a wetness on your face. It’s the epitome of freedom and happiness.

Then comes the panic, the realization, like a punch to the gut, leaving you winded in a different way. Your heartbeat skyrockets, and your body shifts from flying to flailing in less than a second. The dizziness isn’t from the fall anymore. 

But after that comes the acceptance. The peace that comes with inevitability. If there are regrets, it’s too late now. Nothing can save you now. It’s acceptance that slows your heart down, calms your breathing, and brings back a small hint of euphoria before it all stops.

I witnessed many get taken away

My first time there was the only time I dared

Then the presence of something beckoned for me
It’s all I could hear, no giggles of glee

“*We request any medical doctors on this flight to make themselves known to cabin crew. Attention passengers please. Any medical doctors on flight*”. 

The uneasy hum in the plane died down for an instant, as a greying woman stood up, together with a younger man who called out “excuse me! I am a nurse, perhaps I could help?” 

A beautiful flight attendant who looked as if she belonged in a commercial for Qatar Airways rather than stuck in a fourteen-hour flight over the Atlantic, her close-fitting mask emphasizing her sultry eyes and arched eyebrows beckoned both healthcare professionals over. They followed her, adjusting their own masks, their knees and medical bags scraping the legs of their fellow passengers who watched them leave their seats with curious eyes. A heart attack? An unexpected birth? 

It was neither. The flight attendant gestured towards a pale thin girl who had passed out right outside the washroom. Other crew members speedily set up curtains around her. The Doctor and the Nurse crouched by her, and the Doctor began drawing her instruments out of her bag, taking the girl’s temperature and pulse, the familiar routine. The Nurse asked for travelling companions, but she was travelling alone. Kristina Nowak, a Polish student going to the US for work.  

The Nurse studied Kristina’s passport and immunization records, flipping through the papers, noting the countries she had visited and the dates and types of her vaccinations. He frowned and leaned towards the Doctor, whispering urgently in her ear. The Doctor shook her thermometer and held it up in the dull airplane light. Snatches of their conversation filtered through the roar of the engines. 

“*the twenty-minute testing kit…”* 

“*Just hold her head please*”

“*Sterilize?”*

*“Hold her still. Light.”*

Their tension communicated itself across the plane, which was now mostly silent. Even the young children seemed to hold their breath. 

The Doctor looked through the curtain. “I need to speak to the Captain”

The flight attendant did not hesitate. Within seconds the Captain was at the curtain. The discussion intensified. 

“*The directive is clear*”

*“the US is a signatory, as is Poland.”*

*“Do you have the right equipment?”*

*“yes”.* 

*“I cannot accept responsibility.”*

*“All airlines were instructed to cooperate. Please instruct the security officers”*

The flight attendant glanced through the curtain. Kristina seemed quite peaceful now, her shaking had stopped, and even some of her colour had returned. “But she might get better!” she blurted out.

The Captain and Doctor looked momentarily shocked, as if the curtains had started speaking. Then the Nurse spoke gently “It is for all our benefit. She may recover but she could kill thousands, including people on this plane. Public Health directive is very clear. No-one with this variant is allowed to land.”

The Doctor had already prepared the injection. Two normal-looking men from the ranks of the passengers joined them.

I don’t know why I ask anymore. It’s been a long time since I was rear ended into a ditch, and I’ve been on life support ever since. 


I’m not always cognitive, sometimes I get flashes of nurses changing and feeding me, a gorgeous woman I can hardly remember popping in to visit, even priests, ready to bless me in case I happened to slip away. 


I always thought death would be the stereotype; the bright light, the peaceful end to a journey. Instead, there’s only black, interrupted by brief flashes of my hospital room and the discomfort of a tube jammed down my throat so I don’t starve. 


Even though it would be a mercy at this point.


When I heard the gorgeous woman break down in tears, I tried my best to listen closely. 


“Pull the plug,” she sobbed. “Let him go.”


If I could have jumped up and done a little tap dance to celebrate, I would have. How ironic would that have been? That after all this time (years, maybe?) I finally get out of bed at the concept of finally being allowed to die. 


I’m not discounting the sanctity of life. If I thought I’d be able to recover, I would disagree, but given how long it’s been laying in an inky darkness, I doubt I’d ever be back to normal, both physically and mentally. 


I hear sobbing as the cord is pulled, and I can almost feel my broken body shut down vitally. My heart rate slows, breathing becomes more difficult, and finally, I see the white light. 


So I float towards it, drifting through the void into the peaceful afterlife, ready for whatever comes next.


But as the feeling of release washes over me, I notice that once I’ve crossed the threshold of the white light, it’s dark again. 


I look around, although “look” is a loose term. I have no body, just a consciousness floating through the dark. 


*Is this it? I hoped there’d be more.*


Then I feel it. My mind starts to fade, and I begin to forget about my past life, even before the accident. Little bits of me drift away, all the joy I held, the ways I’ve grown and changed, the people I have loved and who have loved me, all disintegrate into oblivion. 


I always believed in an afterlife. Maybe not Heaven or anything biblical, but something more than our silly little lives.


But as I fade away, I realize that there is nothing after the bright light of death, it’s empty, and soon enough I’ll be empty too. 


I wonder what it’s like, to not exist at all. Is it lonely? Scary? Will I be anything like me anymore?


Or when enough time has passed, will I just suddenly stop-"

Though I had my fair share of embarrassment from brushing the clumps of dead skin from my shoulders, or smiling through gritted teeth as possible partners saw the flaking skin around my genitals and politely declined intercourse. This did not trouble me. Sex was a social disease that I fell victim to when unwary, mostly when drunkenly coerced, but luckily the state I left my carcass in put off most visitors.

For you see, I love my disease. The gentle tug and tear at my rotten flesh brings an ecstasy unknowable to the common folk. Watching the red, swollen, puffy flesh spread in all my unseen and hidden places builds a civilisation of sheer anticipation. The rip and relief when it comes away in a single, large, impressive piece is beyong orgasmic. I preserve the biggest pieces. You could make a suit of me, if you were to become me. Though no one would want to be me.

You were different, though. You needed to be someone else. You were boiling to death in your own skin, cooking into a wretched nothingness. A burnt remnant devoid of humanity, devoid of hope, yet desperate for love. You were desperate when you met me. So desperate for a new flesh that you reduced yourself to wanting mine. You overfed me for months, force feeding me until I was stretched out into a rotund thing. Then you starved me. All I had was my peeling and picking. All I had for sustenance was myself. It was not enough. Though you gave me the mercy of skinning me before I died, just so I could appreciate how very wrong I was."

Through the rearview mirror, my eyes stole glances while my tongue whispered prayers for him to not wake too soon, he was tired from playing all day after all. 

I decided to take another route, a shortcut you could say where the land was illuminated by pure moonlight. I had driven this way before, one too many times, so the sense of worry wasn't there. The peaceful longing for home was suddenly interrupted by the sound of my luck running out...the car was starting to break down. 

A deep breath left my lungs as I rested my head on the wheel, hoping that the damage wouldn't be too bad. I took one last look at Drew before exiting the vehicle and popping up the hood. 

Dad had always told me to run the car for check-ups but my stubborness always won, I guess you could call this karma. As the intricacy of the parts riddled my brain, an upcoming beam of headlights froze me on the spot. 

The worry that wasn't there before was surely wrapping its suffocating hands on my body. A girl and a little boy on an empty road suddenly found themselves with company, company of which I wasn't sure I would be grateful for. 

The sound of tires halting filled my ears as the driver of an old pick-up truck got out and approached me. My hand clutched the pepper spray that was chained with my keys as his form got closer and closer. 

""Evening maam"" the man greeted as his eyes found mine before looking at Drew. 

I returned the greeting and explained the whole situation when he asked. His feet carried him back to his truck and came back carrying a tool box.

I could only focus on that box, just in case he tries something.

As he inspected and worked on the problem he continued to chat by saying

""Best be prepared with car troubles maam, you never know if help or danger would find you."" 

I tried so hard not to make an impulsive move as he tinkered some more. It felt like he was deliberately taking his time and the whistling didn't make it any better. 

His smile made me grip the pepper spray tighter and after closing the hood, he returned to his truck and I found myself scrambling to enter my car as well, fear clothed me in a very tight fabric. 

Safety was no longer in the atmosphere of our drive as the truck trailed us. Knowing that there was a fork on the road just ahead, I could only pray that he would take the right lane as my home was on the left. 

I prayed for his vehicle to swerve.

I prayed that my sudden increase in speed wouldn't wake Drew's slumber.

I prayed that the chloroform was strong enough.

I can't have him screaming for his mother again just like the way he did when I took him from the park.

Oh god please hear me out."

Yeah, I tried the video-dating stuff—it just isn’t the same, you know? You can’t really tell if you have chemistry when you’re not in the same room. Still, I kept at it—I wasn’t about to let a global catastrophe get in the way of my dreams!

Anyway, so since I was spending so much time at home, I started to notice some strange things. Like lights being left on when I was *sure* I’d turned them off. Doors being left open. Used glasses left on the table. Food mysteriously disappearing.

So I got a home security camera.

And Dear Internet, I’m sure you won’t be surprised by what I saw. Late at night, after I’d gone to sleep, the attic door opened. And from out of the dusty depths crawled—a man!

That’s right—a strange man was secretly living in my house! Can you believe it?

So, yes, I know the normal thing would be to call the police—but I kind of felt bad for him, you know? He was sooooo skinny and his hair was all tangled—he obviously needed someone to take care of him.

Instead of turning him in and sending him to jail, I started cooking extra every night. Why not? I was working from home, and now I had the time to actually cook, which I enjoy. And it’d be nice to have someone enjoy my food beside me.

So I did that for a bit. Then I started leaving other things around—extra deodorant, razors, clean men’s clothes. I think the last one spooked him a bit, because he didn’t come out for three days after. I was worried he was hurt, so I got up the courage and decided to visit the attic myself.

As it turns out, Matt is actually a really sweet guy! He lost his job right before the pandemic and was sleeping rough. One day my back door was open, and he crept in to burgle me, but when I got home early, he panicked and hid in the attic. He’s been there ever since, trying to take just enough to survive without me noticing.

It’s so crazy, isn’t it? Poor Matt’s had it rough. He really needs taking care of, and he just happened to come into *my* house on a whim!

Anyway, we’ve been getting to know each other. He’s a data analyst by trade and loves scary movies. He wants two kids and to retire to the Bahamas.

Oh! And I haven’t even told you the best part.

He doesn’t have a phone or watch the news, so he doesn’t know lockdown is over! We can stay inside and don’t have to talk to anyone else. Ever. 

It’s like a match made in heaven!"

The ball looked strange: splotches of blue, white, and brown; and seemingly under-inflated. ""What are you playing with?"" she said.

""It's Billy,"" said one of the boys. ""Mrs. Delapan turned him into a ball so he can play with us. It lasts about an hour.""

She frowned, resenting being lied to. Mrs. Delapan lived at a white cottage at the end of the street, with a hanging clapboard sign depicting an eye inside a star. She was a numerologist, a psychic, and a fraud.

Any client would have a name, star sign, or life circumstance adding up to eight, the number of prosperity and infinity. From that Möbius strip, Mrs. Delapan could spin any tale she wanted.

Billy's father, a vocal opponent of such tripe, would be incensed to have his son's name slandered in this way.

""Give it to me,"" Miss Ketteridge said, but the boys laughed and ran away from her, tossing the ball back and forth. She followed, trying to keep them in sight. Regardless of the story they were making up, there was something unsettling about that ball.

She found them in the church yard, playing flag football, or maybe tag. The church dog, a giant sleepy mastiff without a name, sat watch on a shady patch of grass near the front step.

Someone overthrew the ball, and it landed without a bounce at the dog's feet. The dog peered at the ball, leaned forward, and picked it up.

Miss Ketteridge could hear the crunch from across the yard. Like stepping on a pile of dead leaves and branches, atop a puddle of mud. The dog disliked the taste and coughed it out.

The ball seemed even more deflated, as if punctured. Neither Miss Ketteridge nor any of the boys could muster up the courage to take a single step toward that ball.

They all were standing quite still when Billy changed back."

""Really?...And they have no idea who he is?"" Asked John, my boss. I'd not long arrived and we were chatting about the local-madman that had hit the headlines lately.

""Nope, but-"" My hand slipped and sliced into the man's stomach. ""Shit!""

John did his usual huff of playful-annoyance and frowned at me. John was at least twenty-years my senior, but still twice my size, and had seen more dead bodies than he had the living. He's always been a bit of an oddball in that way, but whenever I fucked-up, John would always cover for me. Bless-him. Afterall, he was the Senior Mortician and I was just his forever-learning, bumbling assistant.

""I'm *so* *sorry*, John.""

""It's fine, David, don't panic."" He always says that. ""Just let me finish this one...okay?"" He was never condescending towards me, but more like a father, taking control and letting the son watch and learn. 

Just then, something caught my eye from behind John. All that was there, were more dead bodies. I frowned and scanned the area, but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

""'Are you paying attention, David?"" He said abruptly, making me jump.

""Yes of course, I just...thought I saw something."" I shook it off.

As John continued working, I saw something again.

""David!""

""Ah! I'm sorry, it's just...there's *definitely* something moving behind you...I *swear* I saw something!""

John quickly turned...Nothing. Nothing but dead-bodies with sheets laid over them. He looked back at me, shrugged and smiled.

""Don't tell me you believe in ghosts now, do you David?"" His teasing comment made me smile.

""Shut-up, no I don't."" *Actually, I did.*

John got back to the job and I got back to watching. Then, it happened again. One sheet rapidly jerked and I *know* I saw it that time.

***Twitch...***

""Ahhh! That-that-that body just moved, John! That body just moved!"" I shakenly pointed to the gurney that lay directly behind him. 

""David-""

""What-what if it's *him*?! The-the murderer from the news!""

""David for goodness sake, stop panicking!"" John swiftly whipped back the white sheet to reveal the ash-coloured remnants of a 50-something-year-old man, and after a few seconds, I let out a sigh of relief. ""It's called a Cadaveric-spasm, David, or, a post-mortem-spasm."" He chuckled.

""I know what a Cadaveric-spasm is, John."" I said sarcastically, whilst regaining my posture. ""Wait...Doesn't it *only* occur in the moments not long after death?...""

Johns composure quickly changed and his eyes met mine with a look I'd *never* seen on him before...

My mind raced back to what I was about to tell him before my knife accidentally sliced this poor-bastards stomach. The police had released a statement that morning suggesting the suspect either worked, or still works, within the medical-industry, due to certain evidence found at the latest crime-scene. John must've seen my expression change as I pieced it all-together, and he quickly grabbed the nearest, sharpest tool.

""...Now David...Don't panic..."""

Changin the name of the place would have been enough, jes a hat tip to the fact. Fairbank to Willow Creek. I’da gotten the hint, an you knowut, I’da cleared out. That’d been fine, like a signpost sayin’ don’t come back. I’da left. I woulda— except for Rosa Marie.

That complicated it. They shoulda known that, an I’da still left with her once we courted, but mebe she’s why they couldn’t let it lie. Takin two of the best like that. So they start given me looks an I know what they was thinkin. I ain’t got no right to be happy, not after what I done. 

Ain’t one of them had the guts ta do somethin’ about it man to man, so they went and put the memorial by that tree. “In loving memory of Elizabeth ‘Beth’ Sanchez.” Like spittin’ in my eye. 

I almost thought they let it go. Me an Rosa Marie settled down. Then we had a little girl that looked like her. Like she used to. It was like seeing a ghost. 

That’s when I knew what they dun. Puttin that memorial next to that tree. The Tree. It’d brought her back. Took what shoulda been my child and replaced it with an angry spirit.

Her momma would be busy an I’d find that girl lookin at me with those eyes. Eyes that wern’ hers. Eyes that shoulda stayed buried. Eyes remindin’ me this wasn’t my child, it was my punishment. For wanting something too good for me. 

The day I slapped the accusing look off her face, I knew I was in hell. Rosa Marie thought I’d hit a child, like I’d ever be that kinda man. I told her she knew why, an’ she raged and screamed an then I knew she’d been part of it. All along she’d knew and had played me so she could get her part of getting even for her sister.

So I tried to break the curse and free myself. Break the circle by removin’ my part of it. I gone to the Willow, and under the angry glare of the memorial I dug up the ol’ forty-five I buried ‘neath that tree. Took me all night cause that tree didn’t want to let it go, an was holding it beneath its roots.

Sweaty, hands torn, I freed the accursed hunk of metal, but they was waitin’ for me. Rosa Marie standing there with them, she had the same burning eyes staring hatefully at me from the other side. 

Now all I got is time. 

Time to kill. Thinkin’ on how Beth was dead long before I put five slugs in her. 

Time to remember. It comes sometime in my dreams: the way she looked that night, those burning eyes, the stink of death rolling off her. Just like my daughter: the day I slapped her."

Was it an animal or something more? It sounded like the cry of a baby. It must be imagination, I tell myself, but then again… it won’t go away.  

While I don’t believe in ghosts or demons, there are insane people roaming these streets that do—and they are capable of anything. I rest my head on the cool pillow and try to go back to sleep, but no matter what I do this cry is there. Then something slams against the wall of my house… It’s a sound that confirms for me that it’s not a dream. 

I get out of bed and go to the window… And I see it. It’s dark, but there is definitely something out there in the shadows. There’s no mistaking what it is—it’s a boy. I can tell by his slender build that he is not well fed or healthy. 

I grab my robe and race downstairs to call for help. As I step out of my house, it suddenly turns cold. I look up at the sky, but it’s not raining or snowing. It is so dark out there I can barely see my hand in front of my face. All the lights are off on our street except for one—the lone light shining on this boy. His eyes stare at me. The eyes remind me of the ones that appear in paintings and photos taken by my family all those years ago. 

“Please, help me!” he cries out to me. “My brothers are being eaten alive! Please save them…” He can barely catch his breath, but even then he continues on with sudden vigor.  “I have nowhere else to go—please just help us all! I am so hungry… I haven’t eaten in so long… please give this little boy some food!” 

I walk toward him and stop when I see that he is dead. His eyes are not glassy with hunger, but cold—dead. I can’t hold myself up any longer. I am too weak to even speak, but my heart is pounding so hard it aches. Then all at once I feel strong arms around me and someone carrying me away…"

r4yspl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r4yspl/the_chittering/,The Chittering,196,22,1638201341.0,"In the year 1866, I found myself in the phantasmal town of London, England. Fog hung heavily from chimneys and defused the yellow glow of lamps on eerie streets. 

I had heard a whisper of a macabre monster stalking it's underbelly. For I, a collector of the occult, was drawn to these rumours like a moth to a flame. 

I embarked to find the source of those whispers asmidt the sewers, where those of low bearing scavenge the fallen treasures of the rich above.

Fruitless was my endeavour until I spoke with a Tosher eager to depart his tale. His account held me transfixed. He called it, The Chittering, named so, for the sound heard within the tunnels. 

The narrative grew with accounts of missing people and a description of a pale beast. I knew I had to capture it. If only for my collection. 

They say you can walk for miles under London and never see daylight. This statement rang true an hour into my search. I waded through the underbelly of the ancient town. The cold, malodorous air licked my face with a clammy sweat. Echoes of my footfall scraped back to me in distorted fashion. But something else wove into the sound. 

A chit chit chit, bounced off the stone walls. The hair stood on my neck like soldiers on parade. Fumes from my torch clouded overhead. The vapors stung my eyes and distorted the vision before me. 

I had found the Chittering. 

It had seen me long before I had gleaned it. Those big black orbs worked up and down as I froze, reaching for my pistol. Oddly humanoid, with elongated arms and legs, it clung to the wall. I couldn't discern any mouth or orifice to eat with, and the sound, a steady rapping beat, emanated from its back. Rows of sharp scale-like protrusion along its spine vibrated erratically with my slow approach. 

I aimed my pistol for its head and let off one shot. The beast fell. An ear splitting screech filled the sewer as it trashed in its death throes. For a second, I leveled my gun again. Fortunately, it stilled with the rigor mortis of death. 

The strange creature became more bizarre the more I studied it. The screeching had come from the chest, just below the clavicle. Teeth like that of a dog or wolf, only black with disease showed under the puckering of skin. The knees were bent back, opposed to the normal position of man. And it was pale, hairless and translucent in places. 

I busied myself with the task of bringing this creature up to the surface when the sound happened again. But not one set of chits. Twenty and a score more. A concerto of Chittering that filled the tunnel with malice and my heart with fear. 

When I saw the army of Chittering growing in the dark, I knew I had to run. I left my torch burning the one I had shot and fled."

He didn’t know how his boat capsized or where it went for that matter. He was just fishing and next thing he knew he was splashing around in the ice cold water trying to find something to hold onto. 

He calmed down and looked around but a thick fog was between him and any land that might be nearby. He doesn’t remember where he came from or even where the dock was, too much happened while he was underwater for him to focus on that. 

Not sure what to do, he decided to wait for someone to pick him up, his family knew he was on the lake. So he waited… and waited… and waited. Until his legs started to hurt from trying to stay afloat. Even though he was wearing a life vest, something still seemed to weigh him down. 

The fog did not clear, so he decided to start swimming in one direction. As he started moving, he could feel algae moving past his leg. The mucus-like substance made it feel like tentacles, as it wrapped around his ankle, trying to pull him down. 

The life vest was heavy, and it felt like it was pulling his shoulders underwater. He took off his life vest. 

Every time he moved his arms and legs, he felt as if he was pushing himself underwater. He stopped swimming. 

Slowly he sank to the bottom of the lake. He could feel the algae creep up his leg. As his feet touched the ground, he pushed himself back up to the surface. The fog was gone. He could see land just a bit further away. He kept swimming until he could stand.

While he waded towards the dock, his body was still underwater surrounded by algae."

It all started when my mother in law died. Some freak medical incident. Taken before her time. My wife was the closest to the lady and my son adored her. Myself of the other hand wasn't so fond. Her family became torn like vultures taking anything not stuck down causing more friction and negativity. My marriage began to breakdown and I was focusing myself more on a girl at work than my wife.

I guess that's when it all began. The day after her funeral and a week after we had received the ashes into our possession. Little things at first bumps in the night, floorboards creaking. That was expected in a house like ours. So we thought nothing of it. 

A few days later my son became acting weird pointing and saying nanny nanny! In the hallway by the stairs and then say bye bye a few moments later. We had no photos and evidence of my mother in law here so why would he point?
It soon became more frequent at night he would call out and scream for her looking in the corner of the room like a startled deer in oncoming headlights but as always nothing was there.
By week 3 of owning her ashes the persistent calling and pointing I knew something was up so I tried calling her spirit to leave. But all I heard was silence. 

It was cold and dark that night as I set up to go to bed, closing the stair gate and heading up the dark staircase I heard a breath behind me and a murmured voice softly behind me, ""Nanny, nanny, nanny! Nannys boy!"" I recognised the voice immediately it was my mother in law's. Hesitantly I turned my head to see her suken eyes pierce mine. Her face of anger and sadness gazed at me. ""Don't ever upset my babies"" she screeched. Next thing I knew I was flung back. Head first down the stairs then everything went dark. 

My wife found me the next morning, her mother had protected her babies one last time.

r4vkvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r4vkvg/perfect_child/,Perfect Child,224,15,1638191634.0,"Mom wants me to become a surgeon, which in my mind is nothing short of a mythical fantasy.

Look at me. I can’t even comprehend elementary maths, let alone those organic chemistry classes that she forced me to take. And that is not to mention biology. I literally want to throw up whenever somebody speaks of that subject.

Yet I need to study them vigorously since that is the only way I could get into med school. And also because mom said I can achieve anything, as long as my heart desires it enough.

&#x200B;

When I told her I’ve always dreamt of being a writer, her face turned red and her jaw clenched. She stared at my eyes as if the only thing she wanted to do was to dismember me alive. Her voice cracked as she howled straight into my face:

“Are you out of your fucking mind?”

She slapped me until I could barely stand on my feet and burned all the drafts I’ve hidden under my bed. From that day onwards, I invested all my time studying. Well, I had to, even though I dreaded every single second of it.

&#x200B;

To no one's surprise, I still failed to qualify for med school, and things only got worse from there. Mom would beat me up whenever she heard news about other children from my high school who had accomplished extraordinary feats.

“Did you hear about Kim? She got into the greatest med school in our state, and that’s not even her best offer yet. I wish you were only half as smart as her.”

“Joe from your class was awarded a football scholarship. Imagine going to college without costing your parents a dime!”

&#x200B;

You know, it’s totally fine if she wanted to praise them. But when she referred to each of them as the “perfect child”, that really pissed me off.

&#x200B;

“Mom, you have no idea what a perfect child is” - I mumbled as I removed Kim’s head from her little body. On the table nearby, Joe was struggling uncontrollably, begging to be released. Unfortunately, I would need every inch of his athletic physique to complete my project.

Kim’s neck was a lot smaller than Joe’s, which made sewing the two pieces together a bit more difficult than expected. But that is a small price to pay if you want to combine superior intellect with astonishing strength. “Now that's a perfect child” - my thoughts as I stared at the loosely attached head on top of Joe's body.

&#x200B;

The whole time, I was so excited thinking about how happy mom would be when she gets to witness this masterpiece. That’s why the moment she called it an atrocity, I had to slit her throat and transplant her gorgeous hair into my creation. 

What a pity! She was right about me after all. I do enjoy the work of a surgeon, I'm just bad at keeping my subjects alive."

Then:
 
“Daddy, is that you? Can you hear me?”
 
I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard that. Her voice was like a sorrowful angel. It was also very familiar. I hadn't heard that voice for many years.
 
“Rosie?” 
 
Tears welled up into my eyes. Rosie passed away when she was just 7 years old.

The path leading to the graveyard was dark, illuminated only lightly by the moon. Weeds twisted and grew on the edges; creepers hung down by the sides. I had to push through vast undergrowth to move through. It felt like I was walking through an untamed jungle.
 
Finally the path opened up to where more light fell. Gravestones stood in groups of twos or threes, staring at me solemnly as I walked past. Some had withered flowers lying on freshly turned soil.
 
Finally I found Rosie’s grave. Unlike the others, her gravestone was cracked and worn down by the rain and the wind. I could barely make out the words on her grave.
 
I knelt down in front of it and bowed my head.
 
“I love you Rosie…” I whispered, tears in my eyes.
 
“No you don’t.”
 
I jerked up my head to see my daughter scowling at me. Her eyes were bloody and swollen, her lips cracked and purple. Her neck was bent at an awkward angle. She was wearing a dirty white dress.
 
“You never visited my grave. You just **forgot** about me. You’re a terrible father.”
 
Spindly pale hands reached out from the soil and grabbed my waist, anchoring me to the ground.

For the first time, Rosie cracked a smile. The soil rose up around me, licking my body, the hands dragged me downwards.

He stared at me from the other side of the bed as always, wide eyed, a slight enthusiasm emerging from the edges of his face as he realized that I had woken up.I plaster on a smile for him and get up swiftly. As the egg sizzles in the pan,  I pour a packet of fruity pebbles into a small bowl. Those are little Ronnie's favourites. I arrange it on the empty seat beside me and motion for him to come eat. He toys with the fruity pebbles  and stares back at me with hollow eyes.How I wished he munched cheerfully into the new flavor they introduced, 'Merry Mango' it's called, he would have loved it. 

As I drive to work, little Ronnie studies the dancing trees through the window. I wonder if he would ever feel the cool wind caressing his auburn hair, the sea tickling at his legs or birds humming mellifluous  melodies of his youthful exuberance. 

At work little Ronnie sat under my table, swirling a paper plane around. I thought about his aspirations, maybe he would have been a proficient pilot. He was so engrossed and impassioned whenever I put on those documentaries about planes. I often fantasized about his soothing voice as he would address the cabin ""Welcome aboard, captain Ronnie at your service"". How he would cruise around the grand and beguiling expanse of earth, how every fear or obstacle he faced would be insignificant from above. 

It has become a routine to visit the playground every Friday ,afterall the familiarity of vibrant play-things and chatter of children was a panacea to little Ronnie.I waited for him as he jubilantly glided down the slide  and pretended to play tag with the other children unaware of his presence.  Up ahead in the distance I observed a couple, immersed in each other's eyes and embracing one another lovingly. I wish little Ronnie too had a chance to experience the riveting essence of love and companionship, to be with his muse ,to perhaps guide and nurture young ones of his own. 

I wish 18 yr old me didn't insist on driving after consuming 2 pints of whiskey. I convinced myself I was not too intoxicated , I just wanted to close my eyes for one second but that is all it took to change mine and his destiny.Right infront of me the silhoutte of little Ronnie marching gleefully teased my sight. All I could remember after was little Ronnie buried in a kaleidoscope of red hue as I swerved into his tiny frame. His mother's wailing screams pierced through my ears as she held his lifeless body. 

Little Ronnie has followed me around ever since ,as an endless reminder , trapped in his 6 yr old body haunting me about what could have been of his life."

It’s not because of the dry novels, tedious poems, and boring plays that our teacher makes us read. No, the true cause of my daily anguish is none other than Christopher Stedman. 

Let me clarify one point up front about Chris: he’s dead. Apparently, he stroked out right in the middle of the same English class that I attend. At the time, it wasn’t clear what had caused the stroke. Some said he had a bad reaction to drugs; others claimed a genetic defect. Allegedly, one teacher was overheard saying that he had an undiagnosed brain tumor. 

All of them were wrong. I know what really killed Christopher Stedman. In order to properly explain how I know, you first have to understand the nature of my interactions with Chris.   

Every day, as I enter class, the first thing I *must* do is find out where he’s sitting. Chris changes seats daily, and he loves to hide. If I’m lucky, he’ll just be at an empty desk, his gray hoodie pulled up, with his long brown hair hanging over his eyes. Usually there’s a dark streak of maroon blood that extends from the corner of his mouth to his neck. On these occasions--the good days--he’ll just stare straight ahead at the dry erase board, seemingly oblivious to the rest of the class.

At other times, Chris will be sitting in the *same seat* as someone else. In those cases, it’s impossible for me to focus on class until I spot the aberration: an extra arm here, or a foot there. Sometimes I’ll find him staring at me from the side of my classmate’s face, only two feet away. Those times are the worst! Then, when we lock eyes, he smiles this sick, twisted grin at me until he faces forward again. 

When I can’t find him, it’s because Chris is sitting at *my* desk. How he does this without me seeing, is beyond me. I can tell because a feeling of ice cold washes over my body, and I begin hearing *his* thoughts in *my* head. 

That’s why I know what killed him. 

See, no one misses Chris. He was a horrible person. The teachers didn’t have much love for him, and especially my English teacher, Mrs. White. He never took anything seriously and did his best to harass her at every turn. That’s why Chris was stunned to receive a “Great Job” sticker on an assignment he’d bothered to complete. It was one of those “Scratch-N-Sniff” types. Also, it was laced with some seizure-inducing chemical or other which not only caused Chris to have a stroke, but to bleed and foam from the mouth. Not a very sexy way to go. Chris was--and still is--pissed.

Anyway, Chris has promised he’ll leave me in peace, as long as I kill Mrs. White. I don’t want to; I don’t think I can, but I still bring a gun with me, just in case."
r4k81o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r4k81o/the_creature_facing_me/,The creature facing me,26,3,1638150251.0,"For a few weeks in the end of 2020, I was hallucinating with stress. The hallucinations were mainly faint figures, bugs and flying things. They were all a bit translucid and I could almost always tell reality from hallucination, for they disapeared a few seconds after I saw them. The bugs would startle  me. The figures would startle me too. One time, I saw a woman in my ceiling. 

After some time I got used to it, and my psychologist had already been told I was hallucinating and I was oriented to just wait a few days for it to go away. Days. Weeks. It would go away, certainly.

The one vision I will not forget, that made my heart almost just come out of my throat, is the one I will tell about now.

It was a cold morning and the sky was completely grey with clouds. I walked out of my room lazyly, into the pitch black hallway, and opened the door to the living room of my small apartment. The windows were sprinkled with raindrops and the sun shined a pale light into the room. It was silent, and my two cats and dog were nowere to be seen.

I barely noticed any of that, because as soon as I opened the door I saw it. 

I saw *it* .

It was sitten on my couch, its hands rested polietly on its knees. Its body facing the black TV screen, but its face was turned directly at me. 

It was so horrifyingly realistic. It was nothing like the other hallucinations. It was so real I could swear I could touch it. Of course I would never walk anywere near it to touch it because it was so fucking bizarre. But it was solid, and tactile. It smiled. 

It was a humanoid thing, but its face was deformedly lion-like. And it fucking smiled, that smile was so horrifying. It smiled from ear to ear. And it looked at me with its wide eyes. A smile so exaggerated, with bare excitement.

Its face was skin, and around it were black feathers, that formed a mane. It had a really, really long neck. It was covered in those feathers, but I didnt pay much attention to its body. All I could see is that the mane was adorned with pebbles and small spheres, that reminded me of an indigenous folkloric animal.

I wouldnt have thought nothing of it seeing a creature like that in a movie, but seeing one in my living room was the single most scary thing Ive ever seen in my life.

I cant describe exactly how it disapeared, but it did. After a solid minute of staring at it petrified, I just- stopped seeing it. In a moment it was there smiling at me, and in the next moment my couch was empty.

I was left alone standing there, mildly relieved but still terrified. It was the longest minute of my life. 

Throughout the day, I made peace with it being just another hallucination. It was different from the rest of them but still a hallucination. And I kept seeing bugs and figures for a few days after it went away, but never saw the lion-like creature again.

I drew the creature. The drawing disapeared from my house though, which kinda creeps me out. 


I havent hallucinated again since those few weeks. Ive been doing better. I hope I never forget this, cause its a story I like telling."

You mentioned having had some rather violent intrusive thoughts when dissociated; I was wondering if today, you might be willing to elaborate on those a bit.”

The middle-aged therapist crossed his legs and shifted in his chair, his body language becoming more inviting of answers. His pen scratched something onto pale yellow paper, and Lisa averted her gaze to the floor. She exhaled in a sigh and softly began. “I had one just before I came. It… it was awful. I had stopped at the coffee shop across the street. Just a vanilla chai to calm my nerves.” She closed her eyes and brought herself back in time. 

———————————————-

Amid the usual coffee shop noise, Lisa could hear the group of teenage girls behind her giggling to themselves. 
They’re not laughing at you, she reassured her anxieties. They don’t even know you.
Still, she discreetly checked her shoes for trailing toilet paper, her underarms to see if they bore any odor. Nothing.
See, she internally insisted. Nothing worth laughing at. 
She stepped forward and began to place her order before the friendly barista. Lisa’s meek voice was barely audible, and the cashier asked her to speak up. She did, apologetically repeating her request for a small vanilla chai. 

As she fumbled through her purse for her wallet, one of the girls behind her piped up.
“Come on, lady. Some of us have shit to do.” 

Lisa placed her payment on the counter and turned. 
“I beg your pardon?”

The teen pocketed her iPhone and scoffed, regurgitating her catty demand with an added eye roll. Her friends smirked.

“I’m sorry. I d-didn’t real-r-realize I was causing an inc-c-convenience.”

Then began the mockery. The girls snickered as their friend mimicked Lisa’s anxious stutter. 
“Y-you sh-sh-sh-SHOULD be sorry. How h-hard is it to find a f-f-fucking credit c-card?”

Lisa’s blood boiled with embarrassment and anger. 
She slunk to her car as tried to control her anxious breathing. Her hand felt detached from her own body as she turned the key in the ignition. 

As the girls left, lattes in hand, Lisa saw herself clutch the wheel of her SUV. She watched her hand move the shifter and her black pump press the accelerator to the floor. She saw the vivid crimson of blood and viscera splatter across her windshield and drip onto the hood of her vehicle. She saw herself nonchalantly turn on the windshield wipers and spray down the glass before finally coming back to herself. 
Startled by her rapidly deteriorating mental state, Lisa blinked several times and glanced around before racing into the parking lot of her therapist’s office. She reassured herself that everything would be fine and hurried inside. 

—————————————————-

The morning light wove through the blinds in narrow yellow slits, flashing red as the sirens blared around the corner. Lisa sipped her drink with trembling hands. “I don’t know what to do anymore…. Sometimes they just seem so real.”"

The news reported of a massive highway crash and a flood of patients surged the medical halls. 

The pay they presented was more than what I made in an hour in my waitressing job so aside from the joy of seeing the little one, the cash surely added to it. 

I was greeted with laughter and a toothy grin as my nephew's tiny feet carried him into my arms and with a last kiss and goodbye, his parents went on their way. 

The night found me and Cody eating cereals while watching tv in the living room. The sugary meal wasn't dinner appropriate but his happiness that radiated one bite after the other was worth more than whatever scolding I would get from his mother. 

My attention was then turned to the scratching and insistent barking on the front door. I couldn't see whatever was happening there since the view was blocked by the arch structure of the living room so I turned to Cody and said 

""I think your dog wants to go out""

Cody, without even bothering to face me simply replied with

""Don't be silly aunt Viv, we don't have a dog"" 

I felt my blood run cold and my breathing grow heavy as the barks slowly sounded human."

The station seemed empty, except for an amiable old drunk she recognized.

""You're right about to burst, ma'am,"" he said as he passed her. ""I hope your husband's near.""

""Yes,"" she said, rubbing her pregnant belly. ""In fact, I'm coming to meet him right now.""

""Well then, congratulations!"" The old drunk said with a bow.

As she approached the platform she heard two men talking.

""Oh, Richard, I'm sad you're leaving though.""

""It's too dangerous.""

""This small town life, such vicious ignorance. You should come with me.""

Then, by accident, she suddenly walked right into the dark alcove and stood before the two men, who were kissing passionately.

They pushed each other away.

""Excuse us!"" one exclaimed.

Reverend Maplethorpe!"" She cried.

""It's not what you think!""

""It's exactly what I think!"" she said. ""I will tell the whole town, sirs! Excuse me!""

She marched over to the platform, and the other man followed her.

""Look here, woman!"" he yelled. ""Mind your own business!""

""It's certainly my business,"" she said as she stepped to the platform.

""You ignorant bitch!"" he yelled, and lunged at her.

She retreated, lost her footing, and fell down off of the platform onto the tracks.

""Get up! Get up!"" the man yelled as the train approached.

Angelica looked at the man and got up. She backed away, clutching her stomach. The train's brakes were screeching.

As she turned to get away from it she stumbled back again on the ballast.

The train arrived and the cowcatcher caught her shoulder, decapitating her.

Stunned, the man ran away.

The drunk caught him in the corridor. Disembarking passengers started yelling.

""You did that!"" the drunk roared. ""Let's go!"" He pushed the man back just as the din reached them. The commotion behind them crescendoed.

Soon four men dragged him back to where Angelica's husband Peter wept over her corpse.

""Here's the fellow!"" the drunk shouted.

The reverend interrupted.

""Listen, he's a doctor! Richard, can you save the baby?""

""Yes, I think so!"" he replied.

A constable came running up.

""Break this up!"" he yelled.

""I'll save the baby!"" Richard shouted as he squirmed against his captors.

The husband grabbed him. ""Get to it man!"" he shouted. ""We need room! Everyone get back!""

""That doctor's who pushed her! I saw it!"" The drunk pointed at Maplethorpe. ""Those two was kissing. She saw them, and he pushed her into the train!,"" pointing to Richard.

Peter and Richard were already kneeling over the corpse. Peter had just produced a knife from his luggage for Richard to use.

Now, knife in hand, he screamed ""You fucking pervert!"" and began stabbing Richard.

""Stop!"" the constable yelled. ""You! Maplethorpe!"" He pointed at the reverend. ""I knew you was a queer."" The men who had grabbed Richard now restrained the reverend.

The other constables arrived, cleared everyone away, and decided together how justice would treat the reverend.

Nobody saved the baby."

“You’re a slut.” Stan looked at Dave with a sharp gaze, trying to deflect the sting of shame over the look of disgust on his friend’s face. “Don’t give me that look. This video is going to make me famous.” Dave shook his head in silent disapproval. “All you have to do is point the camera. I’m not looking for your creative input.” Stan was hungry for fame and didn’t care how he was going to achieve it. He was creative in his efforts, but lacked talent, and put everything into shocking people. 

“Are we live.” Dave steadied the camera and gave Stan the nod. “Welcome my disgusting fans to Stans, 7 Wonders of Depravity. I call this weeks instalment Aces Wild.” The camera panned to the rotting carcase of a dead cow. The smell of rotting guts wafted through the air when Stan lifted the incision made in the cow’s stomach and climbed into the belly of the festering bovine. A nervous silence filled the air. Suddenly, a hand shot out of the cow’s ass, followed by another. “I’m reborn,” echoed around the field as Stan’s head emerged from the rotting carcass. 

Days went by, and the view counter for the video barely passed 200 viewers. Before the stench of failure set in, Stan was already coming up with the next big idea.  Dave turned up at the location, not knowing what to expect from Stan. “Why are we at a funeral home, Stan?” Where are you going with this?” Stan had a mischievous look on his face as he followed him to a room at the back. The smell of formaldehyde made Dave heave as Stan lifted the lid of a coffin.  “We are going to scare whoever opens the coffin, and I’m going live from inside.” Beads of sweat began forming on Dave’s forehead. “There is a dead person in there. This is low, even for you.”

As Dave hid, he got the live feed up on his phone. “Welcome my disgusting fans to 'Stan's, 7 Wonders of Depravity. I call this weeks instalment, Scared to Death.” By the time he looked up, the coffin his friend was in was gone. Panic set in as he searched high and low for it. He walked aimlessly around the home until he spotted someone that worked there. 

“Hey, do you know where they took the coffin from the mortuary?” 

“You’re a bit late. You won’t make it in time. That was secluded for the crematorium.” 

The colour drained from Dave’s face as he got the live feed up on his phone.  Stan sounded gleeful in the coffin, waiting for the big reveal. Suddenly the roar from the gas burners switching on could be heard through the phone. Playful taunts turned to desperate screams as the horrific realisation set in. Dave watched as thousands of people suddenly started to tune in. Stan finally got his wish as thousand of people watched him die in agonising pain."

Near no streets or stores, it’s just me all 
alone

Only the sound of calming wind in the trees
And chirping of birds in all varieties

Just alone by myself, I like it that way 
Then a loud croak I hear, a chirp and a bray

Though nature may be a beautiful thing 
I do not recall such a whistle or ring

I look out the window by my own front door 
And see an odd buck that shook me to my core

It toed the edge of my clearing while upright 
I opened the door to yell, “Get out of sight!”

No further it came, it fully understood
I did not want it in my neck of the woods

Then it smiled at me as it got on all fours
And he chirped at me before I closed the door

That chirp alone kept me up through half the night
The smile seemed as if it had known of my fright

Next morning I found hares in a sorry state
Their entrails strewn across the garden gate

I heard a chirp, honk, a bloodcurdling shriek
I locked all my doors and stayed in for a week

The deer just got bolder and pranced on hind legs 
I called any contacts, I pleaded and begged

At the end of the week, it showed its true face
It was then that I had gone mad in this place

No longer did I call that wood safe and sound 
Chitters and croaks and shrieks were all I now found

It’s not a deer, a man, a bobcat or dog
It’s a goat man, a changeling a…."

Suicide is nothing to fuck with. I know that now.

I had been drinking peach schnapps and getting gradually braver and more depressed. I looked out the window for the umpteenth time at the ugly sharp stump three stories below. It taunted me.

A lightning and wind storm had downed our old evergreen. It took us a couple of weeks to clean it up and cart off the logs, but the broken part left attached to the stump whittled up to a sharp point about five feet high. I decided that it would be quite a statement to jump to my death, and have my parents find me, impaled through the middle - a final fuck you to the ever-nasty pair.  I never thought about what would happen if I missed. I soon found out I didn’t need to worry about that. I just didn’t impale the part I wanted to.

I swung out on my windowsill, letting myself sway, closer and closer to letting go. My grip weakened so I knew there was no changing my mind now. I often wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t lost my nerve and tried to swing back away at the last second. I wonder if I would be dead now, and I wonder if that would be better.

I woke in the morning, cold but not shivering, the sun beginning to warm me, Waking up the insects around me. My parents slept in, sleeping off their drunken fight. I couldn’t move, and with my good eye I could see the pointed shaft of wood protruding out of the other half of my face. I was blind on that side, I could tell. From the angle of my view, I could tell the wood entered my upper back, near my neck, and exited my eye socket or very near it. The upside? No pain. I spit away the ants biting my lip and tried to scream.

I lived. Unfortunately? You tell me. They turn me regularly to fight bedsores, though I wouldn’t know if I did have them. Maybe I would by the smell if they got bad. Somehow, I can still smell. I can still hear. My good eye shows me whatever view I am tilted toward. I can’t tell them to turn down the lights or change the channel. I can’t tell them to kick my parents out when they argue, quietly, so they don’t get asked to leave again.

I can’t tell them I wish I hadn’t tried, or that I wish I tried harder. I can’t try again even if I want to. I only got one chance. And my one chance turned out to be, as they say, a swing and a miss. I hate that fucking tree."

&#x200B;

He had given himself *to* them. Parts of him that, when missing, left him hobbling from missing toes and looking out of a single eye. And he would’ve offered them more, *oh*, so much more, had he been formed with more teeth to yank out, more fingers to sever, more skin to brand with symbols and occult markings; more blood.

&#x200B;

What little had been left of Erwan Telesco after years of immolation now found itself kneeling again, in pious adoration, before the searing altar. The flame, ever-burning, hissed at him, promising more, if more was given in turn. It told him of skies that rained down unholy fire and brimstone on bare, naked flesh. It told him of the cries, *oh*, the cries; they bellowed and wailed and pleaded; what ungodly chorus.

&#x200B;

Erwan, his body subjugated to each and every earthly torture, how it longed for it so. For rust-covered pins burrowing under his fingernails, for acid tossed on his face, for his brain to shoot out his ears under the boots of all Hell’s legions and all of Hell’s minions. He wanted his very form destroyed, desecrated; disintegrated. He wanted the nature of his own physiology raped and ravaged; bent, beaten, and broken past anything remotely human. Only for whatever was left of him to be stitched up together anew, to suffer through it once more.

&#x200B;

And again.

&#x200B;

And again.

&#x200B;

And again and again and again and again.

&#x200B;

Forever.

&#x200B;

A final sacrifice.

&#x200B;

No more wide-eyed stray dogs and cats. Just one cut, one simple cut, across his wrists, and it would be his; all, his. The flame told him so.

&#x200B;

With the two remaining fingers of his left hand, Erwan gripped the razor blade between index and thumb, holding it firmly as he pressed it against his forearm. As metal slashed through skin, through muscle and bone, he smiled. Why, it didn't even hurt. This was nothing at all.

&#x200B;

As he bled out, the wound spewing out blood, Erwan’s body finally gave way, having endured its final mortal punishment.

&#x200B;

This wasn't death, he thought, no, this was rebirth. There was an eternity of hangings and beatings and drownings and burnings and shootings and cuts and bruises waiting for him on the other side.

&#x200B;

Erwan Telesco died, and woke somewhere else entirely. The light, bright and righteous, blinded his eyes -both of them. He staggered to his feet, grass tickling at his toe tips -all ten of them- and scanned his surroundings.

&#x200B;

No, this wasn't fire, this wasn't brimstone. No screams were heard, just laughter. No pain, no suffering, only everlasting joy now that all worldly pains and all worldly troubles were left behind. This was a place of all things good and true.

This was Heaven. This was *his* Hell.

That scaring old crows is a bore

You barely have to even flash them a grin

And they've gone belly up on the floor


But children, on the other hand

I take pride with the thrill and delight

When I see them, I strike up the band 

I like when a scare puts up a fight


They cut through my field and over my crop

As a dare, as a joke or a prank

But everytime they seem to stop

When they see me their faces go blank


A sack you see, makes up my head

Inside is stuffed with straw

An old jacket, some trousers make up my body and legs

Propped up by pole in the floor


First I just swing in the wind for a while

Just to set up what is to come next

A flap of the jacket and flash them a smile

I can tell by their face they're perplexed


Then they look past me and see row upon row

Of the children that have come before

And how they're all now little scarecrows

Propped up by their own pole in the floor


Then they look back but alas I am gone

They'll panic and scream and then run

But they'll run deeper  (oh this one's a keeper)

I'll smile again, oh what fun


I let them run wild in a frantic blind daze

Until they're all tired out

At this point they are lost deep in the maze

All filled with fear and doubt


Then they spot my old woven sack

As it flits behind forests of stalks

I'm shocked they don't have a heart attack

Like a mouse when it sees a fierce hawk


Now back at my post, I don't mean to boast

My crow kids are looking divine

Add one more to the pack with their new burlap sack

They used to be yours now their mine


So if you are walking down by my field 

Pop in and just say hello

Send your kids in, if thats how you feel

I can add them to my scarecrow row"

This is my cautionary tale.,1047,25,1638101330.0,"My mom died on Christmas morning, and after six days of liquor and pills, I was determined to join her. Fireworks exploded above my head as I scaled the steep hill on which Pixie’s Throne resides.

In the distance, I heard a faint chorus of ‘Auld Lang Syne’.

The throne is something of an enigma in my village. Nobody knows who built it or when, or how the damned thing got all the way to the top of that giant fucking hill. All’s we know is if somebody sits there, that’s it. End of story. Goodnight Sienna.

It won’t happen right away. In fact, it might even take years. But the second your butt touches that cold slab, you’re a dead man—or woman—walking.

Perhaps you’re wondering why we keep the damn thing around. All’s I can say is good luck finding a volunteer to rip it apart. Sitting on the throne’s a death sentence, what do you expect would happen to somebody who went up there with a sledgehammer?

After polishing off a bottle of whiskey, I took three deep breaths then had a seat. And now it was only a matter of time. 

Later, on my way home, I passed a news year party that had spilled onto the street and, in my drunken state, crashed straight into a beautiful lady wearing a red dress. Picking her up off the ground, I brushed dirt and dust off her legs and shoulders, apologizing again and again.

Then we got to talking.

What followed was a whirlwind romance. It wasn’t long until we moved in together. And then, before I knew it, she was handing me a gift box, one which contained a positive pregnancy test.

Nine months later the twins sprang out, a boy and a girl, both completely perfect in every possible way.

I loved being a Father. I loved changing stinky diapers and all the 3AM feedings. And as my children grew, their personalities emerged, and I fell in love with them all over again. My heart soared watching my daughter dance ballet on stage and plunged when my son came home with a bruised eye, crying and confessing he’d been too ashamed to tell me about his bully problem.

I loved my kids. And I loved my wife. And with each passing day, my love grew and grew, like snow gathering one flake at a time.

So imagine my terror when, just minutes ago, I saw a flutter of pink wings beyond the window. 

Something deep in my gut twisted. Terrified, I kissed my sleeping family goodbye. And now there’s just enough time to pass my wisdom onto you.

Years ago, I reached a low point, and foolishly decided to throw my life away. I didn’t realize how precious and magnificent it could be until it was already too late. 

So please, to anybody who’s thinking of doing something stupid, do me a giant favor…

Don’t make the same mistake I did."

I quietly walked down the stairs and heard my backdoor close. I rushed through my living room and knocked over a lamp. I slowed down once I got to my kitchen and looked around. As I was making my way to the back door I heard a door shut up stairs. In a panic I hit my bat on the table. 

As I heard footsteps come down the stairs I made my way to the back door and left. Once I get outside I see a man standing over a body with a bat. I approached slowly. As I got to the man I raised my bat and hit him in the head. He hit the ground with a thud and I noticed he was wearing the same pajamas as me.

Lord Tarqua's love for Lucretia so devout,

Such passion as can expel all sorrows,

Raise pride that casts no shadows.

That is, till he one evening he witnessed

At a courtly gathering he rarely missed,

Lucretia exchanging a knowing smile

With a handsome dragoon, Ismail.

The episode lasted less than a minute

But Tarqua saw something amiss in it -

Once a man towards doubt begins to lean

He tilts and tilts till he utterly falls in.

Days and nights beset with alarmed fits,

Tarqua sought counsel for his frayed wits,

From a foreign gentleman said to be

A sage of sorts from around the Black Sea.

When of his present woes Tarqua relayed

The wise man of the east thus conveyed,

""Most sublime peril love is,

Mixes equally fear and bliss"",

He advised cryptically as philosophers oft do,

But then, perhaps as a jest, a little tale drew,

""There's one way to confirm, I'm told,

The bearing of affection one does truly hold:

If you extract the heart and set it to flame,

It'll whisper the object of its love by name.""

Alas, to such dire state Tarqua's mind fell

It could not serious from fatuous rightly tell.

Tarqua resolved to cut open Ismail's chest,

Then, put his organ therein to a fiery test.

That night the guards conatoes Ismail took

To Tarqua and hid dagger in the castle nook,

He carved open the breast entire,

Threw the bloody lump into a pyre,

To combustion leaned to hear

Hiss and sizzle but no ""Lucretia"".

This though Tarqua relieved

Only a momentary peace achieved,

For next day he saw a baron nearing

Lucretia too close to be endearing.

Baron's torso, too, was excavated,

Another evidentiary matter extricated.

Then there was a friendly seeming cavalier

Who met hostile reception in Tarqua's shear.

So on went murderous autopsy

With the surgeon's diligent constancy.

And each new day saw someone querying

'Have you seen so-and-so this morning?'.

The stench of accruing rotten flesh 

Did even the topmost steeple splash,

Spreading nausea most relentless

To the cook, the gardners and the laundress.

Aberrant countenance Tarqua bore

Lady Lucretia could no more ignore,

T'was not a man there she did see,

But one bearing Devil's pedigree.

One night, she decided to follow

Tarqua to the subterranean hollow,

Whence night after night he went

To conduct the vile experiment.

As she entered the gore filled cell

Such sight and odour akin to hell

Struck her nerves already much frail

She collapsed like a heedless sail,

Causing an Aphrodite statue to topple

Unto her head, crushing it to strewn rubble.

When Tarqua saw Lucretia's headless body

It did not his mad proceedings unsteady;

He plucked out her heart without hesitation

Fed it to the blaze of confession.

It burned like Beelzebub's coal

And revealed nothing at all."

I can still remember the first time mother took me with her to gather fresh water. The mass of shimmering waves of oceanic blue were magnetic; my juvenile mind could barely comprehend it.   

Luck had it that I’d often return a year later as I’d become of age to join the villagers in prayer. I don’t quite recall the sermons. I was too entranced by the swirling blue of the lake.  One day, during a sermon, while gazing out at the pond, I noticed the shift in color from blue to emerald green. Then something else caught my attention.

“There’s a dead body in the water!”

What followed was an uproar the likes of which I’d never seen before. The place we once considered a sanctuary was now no better than a muddled tent ripped to shreds by beasts of the forest.  

The sermons stopped. Fear and distrust spread through the village like wildfire. Some of the adults thought the gods had forsaken us, others looked upon each other with suspicion.

My mother aired on the side of caution, fervently listening to the chieftain’s every word. My father on the other hand thought the situation was ridiculous.  

He snuck me out to the lake to catch fish unbeknownst to my mother.

As we fished, he explained that everyone was overreacting. The body wasn’t anyone from our village and it had drifted from the opposite side of the lake. He thought it was a lone wanderer that had fatally wounded himself while traversing the forest late at night.

When we came back an argument ensued between my parents. But that wasn’t the worst of it.

People in the village began to disappear, their water logged bodies washed up upon the lake’s edge. It wasn’t long until everyone realized the lake changed colors with every disappearance.

Lavender like elderberries.

Verdant like the grassy plains.

Crimson like raspberries, strawberries and cherries.

The lake was alive, a precarious living entity that claimed souls as it wished. Then the whispers started, malicious words carried on the wings of the water’s breeze, some were playful, lilting and others deep and bellowing. The discordant voices required sustenance of the innocent and youthful.

We were summoned to the waterfront. We sat prostrate upon the lake’s pearlescent beauty. The voice clear as day in our ears. The chieftain gathered up a young babe, not even old enough to run without stumbling, and brought him to the middle of the lake on a raft.  

Sometimes I wonder if the baby knew its life was prematurely ending, born to die so young. At least it didn’t suffer, as the wailing ceased as soon as it was dropped into the glowing waters and just as swiftly as the voices had come, they ceased and the colors of the lake became blue once again."

All good things come from Mama.  Mama’s sweet milk, Mama’s drumbeat heart, Mama’s gentle hands.  As long as I hold tight to Mama’s fur, everything will be warm and safe and good.

The sun on my back is good.  Big sister’s lips on my forehead are good.  Cousins and aunties and uncles gather to coo and groom and cuddle, and they are good too.  Mama is still best.  

I hold on to Mama while she walks and climbs, finding fruits and seeds.  I hold on to Mama when an uncle barks a warning.  Mama runs for the tree, run climb bounce leap, and I hold tight tight tight.  We sit high and safe, Mama snuggles me close, and danger passes by.  As long as I hold tight to Mama, everything will be warm and safe and good.

Mama finds fallen figs, ripe and juicy.  Juice drips on my face; it tastes sweet.  Good, not the same as Mama’s milk, but good.  I smack my lips.  Good.

Lots of figs, Mama reaches for another, and the grass moves.  Uncles scream, aunties run, I hold tight as Mama jumps away.  I hold on when Mama jerks sideways.  I hold on when she lies down, kicking.

Uncles and aunties scream warnings.  I hold Mama’s fur, tight as I can.  As long as I hold tight to Mama, everything will be warm and safe and good.

Mama goes still.  Her warm fur feels stiff.  Then she moves again, funny swinging like in trees, but her tail drags the ground.  I hold onto Mama.

We stop.  Mama lies down.  She feels cold now.  A big cold nose, big as my head, sniffs me.  Charnel breath, sweet-sour on my face.  I hold onto Mama.  As long as I hold tight to Mama, everything will be safe and good.

Crunching.  Copper smell.  Mama moves, rolls back and forth.  I hold her fur.  Whiskers longer than my arm brush me.  I hear the uncles bark, distant.

The nose sniffs again.  Huge white teeth fill my vision.  I grip Mama’s fur harder.  As long as I hold tight to Mama, everything will be safe…"

She was always asleep and when she was awake she'd never talk and at night i swear i could feel an aching feeling in my body whenever i'd try to sleep almost like a horrible stomach ache but in the morning i'd feel more tired and was hungry. Currently i'm only 16 but my sister still looks almost like a child while i looked much older and became frail and my skin was pale, our mother had taken us to the doctor and they found nothing and asked if i've been eating which i had and felt like i was starving in the mornings and then they xrayed us.... nothing.

I'm afraid to go to bed at nights, wondering what the hell was happening to me and suspected my sister was doing something so i pretended to fall asleep early and heard some chittering noises right next to me and felt the pain in my stomach again and opened one of my eyes slowly to catch a glimpse of whatever was that noise and saw my sister, more and more of her body was separated and she now had a full torso and half of her hips and her face wasn't my sister's it was like 2 blackened holes were drilled into her face and mouth was almost like a mosquitos probpscis as it stabbed into my stomach and i could see a reddish liquid getting sucked up and felt the pain as she did it and quickly shut my eyes and endured the pain throughout the night.

The next morning, i woke up and looked down at my stomach to see no puncture was there but some bruising and noticed my sister, she was much more glowing and youthful and looked as if she was molting out of me, it was harder to walk now that she's grown and especially with me getting weaker. The next few weeks i became weaker as my sister became more young and glowing, molting out of me like a caterpillar to become a butterfly and I wanted her out of me, 1 week later before she'd finally get rid of this shell of hers and my mom ignored it and was happy of her growth that'd she would finally have her perfect daughter.

It was my last day, my mom finally agreed to take us to the hospital, though instead of bringing us to the operating room we were brought to a lower level concrete room with bright lights as i looked through the glass to see my mother and father eagerly awaiting the new arrival wearing shirts with ""it's a girl on it."" As doctors surrounded us and finally pulled her out of me and into a warm blanket, I laid there too weak to move as i see them carry her to my parents and them crying and leaving me to lay on that cold metal table as the white sheet was placed over me. 

I was just their daughters cocoon."

A bare concrete floor became my place of rest but rest never came easy for me anymore as I felt the scratching inside my chest a month later and it felt like tiny jagged teeth gnawing on my flesh...it feels like death.

""Oh, dear,"" Heather said to her daughter Lilly. ""I'll take care of it.""

Heather ushered her daughter to the bathroom so they could see that there was no monster together.

""Well, I'm going to look and show you you that--oh!"" Heather said.

There, in the toilet bowl, was a small green frog, swimming frantically around the inside of the bowl, kicking itself in circles in the water.

""See, see!"" Lilly said, tugging on her shirt.

""Oh sweetie, it's a frog! Wow, how did it get there? Is this a prank?""

Lilly pouted and shook her curls.

""Did your brother put it there?""

""No, it was just there, I swear!"" Lilly said.

""Ok, well I'm going to catch it and put it in the garden, all right? Then it'll eat the bugs that keep eating our flowers.""

Lilly watched as Heather got the yellow cleaning gloves out from under the sink. She put them on, and then she reached into the toilet to catch the frog.

After a couple attempts Heather managed to corral and scoop up the creature.

""There was more,"" Lilly said.

""More what?"" Heather said as she withdrew the frog from the toilet.

She noticed that there was a clear goopy thing dangling back into the water.

She looked down and saw that the frog didn't have eyes. It also didn't have a mouth or nostrils.

It was a living thing, thrashing in her hand, but it wasn't a frog. It only looked like one. It was attached to the tubular clear strand that ran back down into the water. Heather tugged on the strand.

The water started to rise rapidly, until it began pouring out of the bowl onto the floor.

""Lilly--""

""There was a snake too, mommy.""

A thick black tentacle covered in teeth swarmed into the bowl, following the strand up to its prey. Lilly shrieked and ran as it rose from the water and slammed into Heather's face with a meaty thud. It bulged and wrapped around as it jerked her down towards the bowl, twisting her body around as the tentacle inverted and the toothy end enveloped her head and pulled it backwards into the water."

I sometimes sit at the kitchen table using my tears to add flavour to my stale coffee. I would sit there and pray my kids didn’t need money for something pointless. These never-ending expenses drain the fight out of me, and all I want to do is disappear.

“Earn extra income from home,” read the ad. I’ve heard of these multilevel marketing companies targeting people like me. I’ve been to those parties. Something was different about this. I didn’t have to sell anything or recruit people. All I had to do was send their test product to all the people in my town.

When the check came in the mail, I couldn’t believe my eyes. They paid me ten grand for a weeks work. Their herbal tea must be good stuff to pay me that much just to send out free samples. The company even sent me a thank you letter with a number to ring if I want more work. I’ve even gotten phone calls from people looking for more samples. It’s been crazy.

Feeling tired, I was drifting off to sleep when suddenly I heard a crash in my kitchen. I lie there, too scared to move, as I listen to the intruders rummaging through my drawers. I nervously jump from the bed and move to the door. My heart skipped a beat when they started making their way up the stairs. “I have a gun,” I shout down. Whoever it was, they were determined, so I grabbed my bat as they burst through my bedroom door.

“What do you want,” I screamed. The wide-eyed, frantic looking woman was frothing at the mouth. “I need more tea. I want it. You have to give it to me now.” The woman eyes turned black as she made a lunge at me before I hit hard with the bat, knocking her unconscious. I ran downstairs and rang the police. The operator on the other side phone sounded strange. “Please, you have to send the police.” “Don’t worry, mam, they’re on their way.” I felt a lump in my throat. “But I didn’t give you the address.” The operator's tone turned menacing. “Just give them the tea, and nobody gets hurt.”

I looked out the window as hundreds of people descended on my house. I dropped the phone and dialled the number of the herbal tea company.  “Hello, Heavens gate tea. How may we help you?”

“Please, you got to help me. They want the tea.”

 I got startled by a noise behind.  

“I’ll give you my baby for a drop of the tea. I need it.”

I turned to be greeted by a woman holding her baby.

“There’s a woman here trying to give me her baby for the tea.”

They had lingered longer than they realised by the lake, the gorgeous sunset making a perfect background for them as they made up from their recent lovers’ quarrel with long lingering kisses and  murmurs of I love you always, I would never cheat on you baby etc.  

Suddenly noticing the evening chill and imminent twilight, they tore themselves apart and with fingers intertwined, began walking back on the main trail towards the parking lot.  

It was funny what had been a busy trail only half an hour ago, full of families, dogs, and runners, had become empty so quickly. The only person in sight was an elderly woman, her shoulders hunched, walking behind them rather slowly in the same direction, presumably to the parking lot. 

The sound of the woman’s crunchy footsteps on the gravel became louder, Maria glanced back feeling uneasy as she realised the woman was heading straight towards them, so that if they didn’t step aside, they would collide. And she was walking at a much faster pace than Maria had first thought, catching up to them within seconds. Maria wondered if she was one of those hateful old bags who would hiss venomously at them for showing affection publicly.  Although that happened in their home town, in this yuppie neighbourhood where they had moved recently, it would be a first.  

Maria gently tugged on Layla’s hand, who was chattering on in her in her usual adorable way, oblivious to her surroundings, to draw her to the side, out of the way of the old lady. The crunching stopped. Maria looked back again. The trail was empty.  

“Layla- where is the old woman who was behind us- Layla!” 

“Huh? What are you talking about?” 

“There was an old woman – she just vanished!” 

“What woman babe? Do you mean her?” and she gestured at a woman sitting motionless on a park  bench by the side of the trail some twenty steps ahead of them.  

Maria shook her head, and stopped. “It can’t be her- she was behind us - she didn’t pass.”   

Layla looked worried “But do you think this lady is ok? Should we ask her? It’s quite dark now, maybe she should walk back to the parking lot with us.” 

For impulsive Layla, there was barely ever any gap between thought, speech and action, and before Maria could voice her unease, Layla had let go of her hand and walked up to the woman on the bench, calling out “Excuse me!”  

The crunchy gravel noise started up right behind Maria’s ear. She whipped around, gasping in terror to see the old woman standing right behind her almost touching her. Although it was almost fully dark now, Maria could make out every twist and turn of the wrinkles carved into her malevolent face.  

The sound of Layla’s scream ripped through the evening.  

Maria turned back again, only to see an empty bench before her and no sign of Layla.  

She was alone on the trail. "

Little baby teeth, sticking out like a bunny-rabbit’s, dimpled, turned-up cheeks, and smiles that could light up the room.
 
But when we grow older, well, perceptions change. No one thinks we are so cute anymore. Pimples blossom on our faces like flowers in a field. Those little bunny teeth are no longer cute. And our faces and bodies change so drastically we can barely recognise ourselves in the mirror.
 
Luckily, there is a cure, a surgery. To make you pretty again, as the press calls it. It has been touted as a miracle. Now, I don’t know about the rest of the world, but for my country, it is very expensive.
 
Growing up, we were never able to afford it. Or maybe we could, but no matter how hard I tried to persuade my parents, they refused to budge. They were the sort that believed in ‘natural perfection’, whatever that was. 
 
And in the all-girls school I attended, the surgery was not just a trend--it was mandatory. 
 
Everybody I knew had it. One by one girls turned pretty, their acne removed, their cheeks chiselled, their eyes big and bright with long lashes, looking like the K-Pop stars you see on television. Being one of the few who had not undergone the surgery, I was bullied mercilessly.  I couldn’t survive a day without running back home in tears.
 
After a day when the last friend I had left had the surgery and moved to the dark side, I finally snapped. Once again I **begged** my parents to let me undergo the surgery, but they still said no! 
 
I was furious. Enough was enough. If I wanted to be like the other girls, I had to do this by myself.
 
***
 
I stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom, holding a scalpel I bought cheaply from Shopee, breathing heavily.
 
I had no anesthetic and no plan. But I was determined.
 
Carefully I traced the scalpel on my cheek, cutting out bits of flesh. Blood trickled out and blossomed on the floor in crimson flowers. To enlarge my eyes I forced the long, thin blade into the eye socket and twisted it. Then I washed out my pimples and acne with bleach.
 
It wasn’t *exactly* what I wanted, but it was close enough.
 
My parents screamed when they saw me. They tried to rush me to hospital, and the staff fainted when they saw my face.  In school, everybody shielded their faces from me, and turned away. I think I was too pretty for them.
 
I think I look really pretty now. Bone-white face and bloodshot eyes, and dried blood scars down my cheeks. I set a new standard of beauty, which I think is even better than the official one. In fact, I’m looking now for desperate, ugly girls who want to be pretty too.
 
How about you? Would you like to be pretty? 😉"

I was punished for a crime I did not commit. The ring was missing. I did not know what to do. I have over a hundred stories about my sister, none of them were good.

I'm on the road 10 minutes away from my destination. My heart is racing. ""Relax, just relax I haven't seen my sister in years"".

We were climbing a tree she tried to kick me. She was beating me. She was blaming me and more. But I love her, she's my sister, she's family.

I'm finally here, parked my car, stepped outside and I enter this large building. People are sitting in chairs minding their own business. A very large man guided me.

I sat in a chair. 

""You have a visitor"" 

My sister stepped out, she doesn't look good. Her hair is messy. She was wearing an orange uniform.

""Hi sis, long time no see. Are you alright""

...

""Is their anything you wanna say to me""

...

""You're still my big sister, y'know""

...

""I guess I'll leave"""

It’s the last line of Christina’s latest note to me, which she’s typed and left in an open MS Word doc, on my old laptop. It’s more than heartbreaking to read, just as it was devastating to watch her move her fiance, Brian, into the bedroom we used to share as husband and wife.

Fighting back the tears, I type, *No. I love you,* beneath her note, then slam the laptop closed. Confident that the noise has woken the two lovebirds, I head outside into the cold autumn morning. 

Even though I’m no longer welcome in my own house, I still can’t bring myself to leave. It’s my property: I’d purchased it well before we married. However, these days I’m really liking it out by the shed; hanging with the shovels, rakes, and power yard equipment. It’s peaceful back here.

I grab a shovel and set myself to digging behind the shed. Digging helps me to get out my frustrations; I find it mildly therapeutic. After a few shovel-fuls, I grow restless and move to a new location: the vegetable patch in the front of the shed. Christina and Brian hate when I dig there. She’ll eventually come out and fill in the holes, like usual, as Brian yells at her about how they need to move. While he’s doing that, I’ll just sit back in the bushes and laugh, as usual. 

As I excavate deeper into the soft dirt, I try to remember what went wrong with Christina and my relationship. Sure, we’d had our share of arguments, but it wasn’t until she’d started spending longer hours at work with her new coworker, Brian, that things really began to go south. 

It all culminated with an awful dinner Christina made for me one night. It should have been good--it was steak and potatoes--but it just tasted off. I remember I made a comment about it and she got this scared and worried look in her eyes, as if I’d caught her doing something she shouldn’t. It was strange.

Down in the hole, I hit something solid. The dirt had been very soft, so it hadn’t been hard work. At the bottom of the hole, was what appeared to be the top of a wooden chest. Seeing that chest, I’m instantly flooded with memories...memories of pain, heat, and sheer terror. I drop the shovel and stagger back. Behind me, I hear the screen door open. 

Brian and Christina are arguing when they come running out. They’re arguing about my note on the laptop. They’re arguing about the hole I dug. When they extract the chest--which is apparently full to the brim with a fine, gray powder--Brian tells Christina she should have “dumped *him* in the river, far away from here.” 

Dumped who?

I know I’m not wanted here and I should just move on. I just can’t bring myself to do it."

That's what the homeless man said outside our new house. I didn't know what he meant. Before I could take in his shabby clothes and scraggly beard, he was gone, off down the road.

My dad said he was just a village weirdo. That this town had a few of them. 

We didn't want to move, but a family tragedy had forced us. Dad didn't talk about it much. Mum neither. She has always been quiet. But since that day, she seemed to go into her shell even more. 

I was surprised when my sister, Chester, came out of my new room holding a weird looking watch. It was stuck at 2:59 am, even though the second hand moved on. 

I wondered why such a strange object was in my new room, being entirely empty other than my things from the move. I thought it must be what the man was talking about. I didn't tell my dad. He had enough on his plate. 

Later that night, I woke to a rapping at the window. I glanced at my bedside alarm and jolted awake. It was 2:58. 

The tapping increased. I jumped up and pulled open the blinds. The man was there again. Eyes wide. Frantic. 

""Have you got it? Is it safe?""

For a moment, I wondered what he was talking about until I felt a lump in my pocket. Surprised, I pulled out the watch. 

The man sighed with relief. And then looked around the dark street as if someone or thing was watching him. 

""Don't take it out of the house. It must stay inside or he will come back. The one who gave me this!"" He pulled aside the sheen of hair to show a deep laceration. Worms or maggots wiggled inside, like the scar was infested.  

""Got it? Do you understand?"" 

I nodded, numbly. Something moved behind his eyes. Wiggled like a fish. He took another quick look and bolted away. 

I didn't sleep that night. Scared that whatever had hurt the man, changed him, would come back for me. 

After breakfast the next morning, Chester and myself went off to play in the yard. There was a tall tree with a tire swing. After some time, Chester grew bored and went inside. I kicked the heavens, enjoying the wind in my face. 

""Let's play with this,"" Chester smiled, holding out the timepiece. I froze remembering the man's warning. 

As soon as she stepped past the door, the clock started to click and with every second I felt the ground move. Worms slithered up from the earth. The man's face sprang to my mind. The deep wound. The wiggling.

I grabbed Chester and ran inside. 

We didn't tell my dad until tonight. 

The worms crawl under our door. Fall down from the chimney. There's only a few hours until 2:59. 

I don't know what's going to happen when that time comes. But I'm petrified."

""Please, Officer, listen..."" I said nervously.

""Sir, I want you to shut up and keep your hands on the steering wheel where I can see them...""

There were splashes of blood everywhere. Blood on the back windows, blood in the foot-well, and blood on my hands. The body of a woman, Carol, I think her name was, and 78 years old, was now slumped on my back seat. Apart from it having a few blood spots here and there, the body was completely untouched. She was fresh.

The growing smell of dead blood and rotting flesh was forever lingering; floating and recycling through the air like some sort of dance, sticking to my skin and clinging tightly to my nostril hairs. It was a smell like no other; a putrid and sickening mix of faeces, strong urine, and about a hundred rotten eggs. I had to get her home. The pain in my stomach grew stronger. I desperately need a drink.

""Off-officer?..."" My voice was weak. ""Please...l am not a murderer..."" He wasn't listening. He was still pointing his pistol in my direction as I looked across at my old work bag, comfortably resting on the passenger seat. **'Crest'** was the only visible or readable word on it.

""P-Please...I just...I just, need a drink..."" My head flopped as I struggled to keep my hands on the wheel. I glanced at my bag again.

*So thirsty...*

The strong will to survive took over and I slowly released my hands.

""HEY! DON'T YOU MOVE!"" Yelled the officer, repositioning himself and getting ready to shoot.

""WAIT!"" I somehow shouted back. ""I just need a-"" I turned to grab my bag as fast as I could, but as it just so happened, the officer was a damn good shot.

The back of my skull was the bullets entrance, my left eye was its exit.

&#x200B;

\~\~\~In my work bag, the officer would find all my tools and utensils that I had used on my previous assets and was going to use on Carol. He would also find a drinks bottle that I was reaching for and that was full to the brim with that life-saving, dark-red goodness.\~\~\~

""Well, anyway, his liver was rapidly failing and he would have eventually died over the next few months. Poor guy...He clearly thought that drinking human blood would somehow cure him.

I remember my first project: repairing my beloved teddy bear. Its arms and legs kept falling, exposing the stuffing underneath. My eyes were strained from pulling the thread through the eye of the needle too many times. After hours of suffering, I threw a tantrum, much to my mother’s disappointment.

“Sewing is an essential life skill,” she said, putting the mangled remains of the teddy bear back in my lap. “How will you keep yourself in one piece when you can’t even keep this bear together?”

She made me re-sew each arm and leg over and over again, until not even a wrestler could pull them apart.

Another time, I fell on some glass shards while riding my scooter, and a long red scar appeared on my leg. When my mother saw it, she sighed. She washed the wound, got a thin needle, and stitched the scar together. “There,” she said. “Be careful next time, or I’ll need to stitch you together again.”

I kept in mind how she had repaired the rip in my leg. It became useful a few months later, when I had to repair her myself.

That day, I came back home from school to find that she had fallen down the stairs. Her head had split open, blood pouring out of the hole in her forehead.

In my panic, I did the only thing I could - I sewed. 

Readying my sharpest needle and some flesh-coloured thread, I stitched the hole together. My shaking hands made the stitches uneven, and in my fear I pulled the thread too tight. Skin is hardly an ideal material to work with, since it stretches like elastic. 

Still, I tried my best.

Even though I had sewn so tightly that no more blood leaked out of the hole, her eyes still didn’t open. So, figuring that she needed some help, I stitched her eyelids open for her.

The next week was full of replacing patches of discoloured skin, picking out and re-sewing stitches I wasn’t satisfied with, and waiting for my mother to wake up again.

It was the smell that alerted the neighbours - as much as I tried to wash her, I couldn’t get it to go away. The police took my mother away from me, and locked me away in a grey room with metal chains on my hands.

Maybe they took her away, because they knew how to repair her better than I did. Maybe they can stitch her together, and left me here to wait.

I just hope they can finish repairing her soon."

Other than something wanting to swallow him whole

He was having the time of his life in here


The light flicked on

Shadows dispersed 

Monsters gone

""It was there I swear, long just like a snake""

He pouted , ""that's not what I meant""

She stood and crossed the room elegantly

Opened the door, he waited to see what she discovered.

She pulled out a jumper with torn sleeves in long strands

I have grown sick of my girlfriend.

She's driving me crazy.

I know I should've asked her before taking such a huge decision for both of us, but I've apologised already. So many times. And yet she's denied talking to me. Hell, she doesn't even look at me.

I agree that we couldn't have a bigger room. If it was in my hand, I'd have accommodated both of us in the Taj Mahal itself. But it wasn't.

She needs to stop being mad at me.

She never acknowledges my sacrifices.

We both belonged to different religions. And when our families didn't agree to our relationship, I decided to be with her— here, away from each one of them.

I asked her to come out with me to take a stroll in the midnight light for the umpteenth time tonight. But she didn't budge.

Isn't it serene to see how the feeble, cold breeze sways the stern tress so easily? Isn't it beautiful to imagine how the crickets must be dancing in groups in the unlit area of the yard by only hearing their sounds?

But I guess I did not think it through. I can see that she is not happy with me.

It feels like the promise we made to always be together was all just meaningless words coming out of her faulty mouth. It was just me who meant it.

No matter how much I shout at her, she remains unfazed. And unmoved.

I know I committed a big mistake and she has all the right to be angry with me.

I know I shouldn't have gone overboard when our families threatened to separate us.

I know I shouldn't have secretly sedated her and brought her to this graveyard.

And I know I shouldn't have buried both of us six feet under in this grave after injecting poison into our veins, that too all without her knowledge.

But I did this for us. For that one promise we made to each other: to always be together.

Then why is it only me who's not left Earth, even after being dead for years?

Why did I have to see her blooming skin gradually shedding off of her lifeless body, only to be devoured away by the vile maggots?

Why did I have to see the unique face I fell in love with once, replaced with the grotesque skull that every other person shares similarities with?

Why did her soul not rise from her body when mine did?

Why are we not together when we took our last breaths together, hand-in-hand?

Why am I stuck here, alone with her withered bones, for eternity?

Or do the people who say that every religion has its own hell and heaven say right?

That maybe we can't be together even after we died?

That maybe I am in *my hell* here and she... is in *her heaven* right now?"

The moron best friend who cut me off suddenly would've still blown a tire and slammed into the pole.

I know. I can foresee it. I have visions lasting 100 seconds. I don't control what I see.

Foresight doesn't make me a charming man god from slightly overweight, mediocre man with lost ambitions struggling for life.

Knowing something is different than doing something. 

I know Rose would the only love I will ever get in my life. I know her pearl eyes would be the most beautiful thing I will ever come across. I know she would hold my hands and make feel the happiest in world. I know we will go on long walks talking about universe and our existence.

I know Rose would say yes when I will sit on my knees with engagement ring.

I know. I know one day Rose will have tears in her eyes. I know she would say she is loosing interest, she would say that our thing isn't working out. She would say something about taking break. One day, I know I will be boring. 

I know....one day, Rose will leave me. I will be alone. Heartbroken.

A curse.

I know, the sun will disappear like a light bulb popping in an empty basement, leaving darkness so complete a brain invents color to compensate. There, then gone, in the space between seconds. everything will just be cold. 

Everything will be in chaos. Dark winter will follow. Slowly....every life form will perish.

Should I tell 7.9 billion people to take care while it lasts? 

Should I tell them to show more love? 

 Should I tell them to kiss the loved one goodbyes?

Should I tell them about the end and it doesn't matter?

I don't know.

Maybe I don't know as I sit on my knees now, Rose's eyes go wide, I pull out of the engagement ring from my left pocket. I see her laughing, dancing...... she wraps me in her arms. ""Yes.""

It is my first full-time job, and I hate it. The pay is horrible, and I frequently work long shifts. The bosses scream at me a lot. The worst though, is the customers. Most quietly pay, but some of them think they are the kings and queens of the planet.

Black Friday drew those people in like a magnet. It was already stressful as it was, what with everything on sale up to 80% off. Queues stretched out as far as the eye could see, snaking around shelves and counters. The job had become monotonous--scan, enter, pack, go. My eyes were getting tired from staring at the screen for so long.

Enter Karen and her bratty little son, who I shall call Dylan. Already from far away I could smell trouble. They had not even paid yet, and Dylan, who looked no older than seven, had already ripped off the packaging of a brand-new Nintendo Switch and a video game (I think it was Mario Kart), dropped the packaging all over the floor (his mother was carrying the TV parts), and already started playing intensely. When they were second in line the boy lost a match, screeched like a little demon, then DROPPED the Switch and began STAMPING on it.

The glass cracked.

And hoo boy, when it was their turn to pay.

K (holding up the Switch): Your Switch is faulty. I DEMAND a new replacement immediately.

Me: Ma’am. I saw your son CLEARLY broke it. Cameras can prove it. We can get you a new one, but you must pay for BOTH Switches.

K: My little angel DIDN’T break anything! GIVE ME A NEW ONE FOR FREE RIGHT NOW!

I was very tired, fuming mad, and done with her. I didn’t really want to start a fight, especially since there were so many people behind her. Instead, I called security, made her cough up the money, and forcefully got her to leave, with her screaming curses at me.

But that wasn’t the end of it. I couldn’t get her face out of her mind. She haunted my dreams for days on end. And every time I thought of her, I got really mad.

So in the end I got some clay and sculpted crude images of Dylan and Karen. Then I stuck needles all over their body.

I could hear screams from a few houses down. I didn’t know those two lived so close by. The police said in a statement on the news that night that they looked like human porcupines when they found them.

Finally I could sleep easy. I may be the killer and an asshole, but at least the world was rid of one more Karen."

""Anyone who's played with a kitten basically knows how to play with a lion."" That's what I told the newcomers.

Bob the Barker and Gumdrops were playing cards behind the trapeze net.

I'd tried chasing Bob around, screaming in his face for weeks, thrashing his trailer. Nothing got through to him. I had taken to following him around and watching him. Months drifted by. I didn't really know what I was doing.

Gumdrops was complaining. ""I tell ya Bob I can't stand the shows right now. It just feels like every bad thing happened at once, and now, I'm just lonely. I'm getting old, and the road is lonely.""

""Gonna off yerself like that sissy Jimmy?""

I was past screaming at this point. I just watched.

""Jimmy was sad because when Riley died.""

""Sissy love? Makes me sick.""

""I don't know,"" Gumdrops said. ""I thought it was all very sad.""

""It was sad they thought it was a secret,"" Bob said. ""But I never said nothing.""

""Yeah, it was the marks that killed Riley,"" Gumdrops said. ""And that killed Jimmy.""

""Better that way, if you ask me. Anyhow, I didn't do it,"" Bob said.

Then, the most amazing thing happened. I saw that Livingsworth the lion was loose. He just trotted up from out behind the trailers where his cage was, and nobody had noticed. Since Riley and I had been gone, I supposed the workers weren't doing a good job tending to Livingsworth.

You know how cats will look off randomly at nothing? Well, that day, I was that nothing. Livingsworth was looking right at me.

I had my chance! I took it instantly!

I moved down and pawed at the ground. I knew just how to get Livingsworth to play, because I was a lion tamer.

That's when Bob realized Livingsworth was loose and running towards him.

""Hey! Hey! What the hell!"" He shouted. ""What's the fuckin' lion out for?"" He jumped up from the card table and started to run.

Gumdrops was always so slow, somehow. He could juggle seven pins on a unicycle, but he always reacted to things right around him like he was asleep. He'd barely moved by the time Bob was running.

It all worked, just like I hoped. Livingsworth chased Bob, because he ran, and that's what cats do. Then he knocked Bob over and bit the back of his neck.

Of course then there was a huge commotion, but I just tuned it out.

After a while, Bob approached me.

""So, you're here,"" he said. ""You just hang around, huh? I bet you got a kick out of that, huh, Jimmy?""

""I sure did, Bob.""

""You know, I didn't do it. I didn't kill Riley. It was strangers.""

""I know that,"" I said. ""All the same, that was a good show.""

""Look at you,"" Bob said. ""Now I'm dead, and you're just beaming!""

I shrugged."

Jette understands they’re here because she killed everybody in the house. Family of three. Peter had brought her food like on most days. Often, it would make her feel dizzy, lose track of time and herself. She knew there was something in it, but she had to eat. This time, when Peter came in to feed her, Jette jumped at him and bit on on his Adam‘s apple until it collapsed. Peter wasn’t as careful any longer as he’d been in the beginning. 

Martha came next. She managed to put a kitchen knife in Jette‘s shoulder before Jette got her thumbs into her eyes and drove them in deeper until Martha’s grip around her wrists weakened and she finally let go. 

Lorraine watched her mother die from her wheelchair. She didn’t have much to resist with when Jette came over her to bite her tongue off. The taste is still in Jette’s mouth. 

“And you say they were your host parents?“ the woman asks as a paramedic treats Jette‘s shoulder. None of them can keep their eyes off her for long, they all study the sores and the places where the flies have put their eggs. 

Jette nods. “German.“ As if her accent didn’t give her away twenty minutes ago. “Austausch. Okay? They say you’re here, you’re family and smiles everywhere. But then it started and all smiles gone and I wasn’t family and nobody pretended I was anymore, and they say go to the room and stay, it’s better for you and for us and everybody will be safe.“ 

The woman stops taking notes on her phone and looks up. „Started,“ she says. „Them locking you up like this, when that started?“ 

Jette shakes her head. „Corona of course,“ she says. „They say go to the room so we don’t catch it from each other. So we don’t die. Quarantine.“ 

The woman turns around to the man and back to Jette. „Corona?“ she asks. 

Jette nods. She had a mattress, a bucket and a TV instead of a window in her room. After a while the antenna broke down and she watched static noise to soothe her loneliness. But until that day, the news had been Corona and Corona had been the news. That policewoman says it like she never watches the news. 

„You mean this began with the pandemic?“ 

Jette nods. Her shoulder hurts but she’s been hurt worse. The woman turns to the man for longer this time. He shrugs. The woman puts her hand over Jette’s and looks into her eyes.

 When suddenly my phone rang, I pick it up and it's my friend:

""Hey Chloe, how are you?""

""What's up Julie!  I responded""

""Listen, I heard that not far from Azure Street, there's a haunted house set where supposedly, there's a killer clown who chases you through the whole house...""

""Let me guess, you wanna meet there?""

""Yes, is 10 o'clock ok?""

""Sure, see you there.""

 I quickly put on my coat and shoes, then left my apartment. As I started approaching this, old, broken down house, situated in this dark, foggy forest, I saw a naked body on the porch of this house. I also saw a trail of blood leading from the body to the back of the house. To my surprise, the blood has an extraordinarily disgusting smell, that which fake blood doesn't have. I started getting suspicious as i pass the body, the smell always so putrid, but I ignored it. 
 As soon as I enter the house, a bloodcurdling scream sends me back outside the house, making me shiver in fear. Nevertheless, I continued. I looked around me, but the thing which stood out the most out of all the blood splatters and broken glass on the floor, there was an obese body in the corner. But what stood out is his stomach was ripped open, his intestines where stuffed inside his stomach. Another scream follows from the second floor of the house as my phone rings in my pocket. It's my friend, again:

""Chloe, where are you?""

""I'm already inside the house, those guts look so real""

""Chloe, which house did you go to""

""The one behind the graveyard, why""

""Ru-""

 Another scream follows from the second floor making me drop my phone, ending the call. I hear footsteps coming down from the stairs. Out of fear, I run into the the corner with the obese man. Out the corner of my eye, I see bright red clown shoes from the top of the stairs lead by a high pitched laugh."

Don’t you see them shining? So brilliant in their appearance. But it’s sad. You see they're all leaving now.

No one knows why but ever since that day, they’ve been going out. Steadily one by one, all across the universe. Scientists were baffled, as far as they could tell those stars never went supernova, never faltered. One minute they were there, the next they weren't.

The scary thing is it must have happened millions of years ago that they vanished, we were just seeing the after light.

There's so few of them now. Panic has erupted in the street. Now every night if you look up you can see them going out. Little patches, five or eight at a time.

It didn’t help that Nasa was tracking a massive object approaching from space.

The news outlets warn of disaster, the cults preach of Armageddon.

But now, dear god…

We can see it from down here. It’s like an eclipse…

Blocking part of the sun.

I…

I…

The shelter will last right?

I’m so cold."

“That was horrible.”

“Yes it was, sweetie. However, Pandora managed to find something else inside the box.”

“What was it mom?”

“A beacon of light for humankind to hang on. It was Hope.” - She said as her eyes stared at the distant horizon.

“It makes no sense. Why is Hope inside Pandora's Box with all those things?”

“Ummmmm…. I don’t know dear. Look, it’s already time for bed.”

“But I want to know why. Can you promise to tell me the answer tomorrow?”

“Okay, I promise. But you have to sleep right now. Good night darling.”

&#x200B;

Mom loves to read me stories every night. She says it calms her down and gives her a break from the real world. Otherwise, she would spend her time drinking and she doesn’t like that. I can tell you that it is the truth.

Yet when I woke up this morning, I found an empty bottle of Vodka on the table. Looks like mom has been drinking and crying herself to sleep again. And somehow that is not the only uncommon incident. The mythology book from last night is nowhere to be found on the bookshelf. If there is one thing about my mom you should know, it is that she is extremely tidy with her books. She never forgot to place them back after her reading sessions.

“Mom, you there?” - No answer.

I walked into her room. The only thing that immediately attracted my attention was a black box with crimson marks all over its surfaces sitting neatly on her work table. Inside, there were hundreds of pictures of mom and dad when they were together. Everything from the very beginning of their relationship up until the day dad left. I found a handwritten note at the bottom of the box, one that wrote: “I will come back if I truly loved you”.

Later on, I found mom lying in the bathtub, drenching in her own blood. My book was found on the floor, torn to pieces. Only one page was not shredded, Pandora's story. There was a small note attached to it. After all, she did leave me an answer.

“Why is Hope inside Pandora’s Box?”

“Because it is one of them”"

I crave simplicity - I need to go to back to the basics. To put behind me every relationship flop, every ghosting, every disinterested statue scrolling through her phone across from me. Past all of those damned screens and the women who fall more in love with technology than they do me. 

But *how far back* must I go?

The “child genius” headlines had to lead somewhere; in this case, at the Machine in my old, half-deaf mother’s basement again. I twisted its dial until the red numbers displayed “-10,001”. There would be nothing more simple than this. I confidently punched the green button before slipping into the glowing doorway that appeared. 

I was in a stormy wood that smelled of petrichor and mammals. The jump was successful, as usual. The Machine placed me right where I needed to be, in front of a rocky structure sheltering a damsel in distress. A stone cold, Stone Age babe.

 I didn’t have time to research specifics, to get to know the era or area any better. I had to get on with my life. So, homemade phaser in one hand and a Wonderbread PB&J in the other, I lured her back through my glowing doorway. Getting her to come along went smoother than I'd thought; the power of processed food grows more tantalizing across the millenia. 

Just as expected, she was grateful to me. Eventually. In the basement, I gave her everything beyond her wildest dreams and more. More of those tantalizing foods, clothing, activities. It took unimaginable effort, but with my (and YouTube’s) teaching, she reached the point of sophisticated behavior and speech, albeit with a heavy accent. She was ready. 

With a few spun tales, my mother and coworkers were convinced she was on visa from Djibouti - it was the same region after all, give or take several thousand years. Things were on the up. 

Until the day she asked for a damn phone. 

I relented after much begging on the condition that it’d only be used to contact me - maybe to watch cute cat videos, her favorite. I watched with a cautious eye, scrolling through the phone nightly as she slept heavily beside me. 

She was very good at hiding it, for awhile. 

But it was one slip-up, one “I’ll save you from him” text received, that did her in. Tears in my eyes, I bound and slipped her sleeping form over my shoulder. Dusting off the green button, I pressed it just once more and tossed her unceremoniously through the doorway, back to somewhere in 10,001 B.C. 

Laying on the floor, bawling without fear my mother would hear, I know I’m not sad because of *her*. I’m sad because after doing this at least fifty times throughout human history, I still haven’t found a woman who won’t turn into another cheating Stacy. 

How far back must I go?"

She was sitting in the lake, head just above the surface, making no effort to move or stay afloat. Her eyes, glazed over, continued to stare on at the mountains in the distance. The joy that came from her finding was short-lived, as she was almost immediately brought into a clinic for a checkup. Within those walls, surrounded by doctors and family members and a reporter from the local newspaper named William Klancy, Eliza May sputtered the word “Surface” and died. A terrible loss, to lose one so long. But her words had intrigued me. Under the cover of darkness three weeks later, I snuck out of my house and made my way down to the lake. Its waters shone and glistened underneath the moonlight. I stripped myself of my clothes and stepped into the waters. They were cold, really cold. I forced my head under. Now, I had been led to believe for my whole life that the river, while not shallow, was not deep either. I don’t claim this to be an intentional lie; I think everyone who told me that believed it, but they were wrong. The river seemed to go on and on forever. Down, down, down, like a canyon or a chasm. And yet, despite its depths, the river was lit all the way down. My first instinct was to believe the moon was far brighter than I had ever thought, and its light was shining down,  through the waters, and illuminating the river’s depths. But as I stared at the light, I realized this could not be the case. The light did not shine down, rather it seemed to come up towards me. The light came from down below. Something in that chasm illuminated everything else. I was curious, intrigued. Fright, while present, was not in the forefront of my mind, instead buried in the very back, only a notion or a flicker. I swam down. The ground got thinner as I made my way into the chasm. The light was brighter down here. It most certainly came from the ground. I made my way down, down, further down, until I was just above the source of the light. The river did not seem to have a floor. There was no base. The source of the light was the bottom of the river but was not the ground. As I was busy thinking about this, the light blinked. It was gone, and then it was back. I was not staring at the bottom of a lake, but the eye of what lied below it. Understand, I am a six-foot-tall human, not small. That eye, if it is what I believe, was at least four times my size. And then I understood. Our world was the surface for something far greater, something aware of us. All we can do now is hope it decides to stay beneath the surface."
r28p36,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r28p36/its_a_new_way/,IT'S A NEW WAY,36,6,1637880874.0," After Jewls’s best friend Tish killed herself in the boys’ bathroom, the school tried to be vigilant. And Ryan, Nico, Ahmed and their henchmen backed off a bit. The school hallways became slightly less risky, but not for long. 

For everyone knew the most dangerous times at school were when the hallways were crowded, in between classes. During class hours, the hallways were creepy, but empty. 

In the crush of the hoard of teenagers– that was the danger zone. Jewls and their friends tried to stay close together, using their backpacks and binders as shields against the blows inevitably thrown at them. Something about their lopsided, multi-coloured hair, clothing, and names, mostly chosen by themselves, attracted a violent fury. 

Like now. 

Ryan shoved Jewls against the wall with his shoulders, while Nico and Ahmed crowded their friends away from them. Jewls tried to push him away, while flinching against the blow they felt coming their way. But Ryan didn’t lash out. He shoved his face close, without actually touching, opened his mouth and starting barking, just like a dog. 

Jewls shook their head in confusion. Nico and Ahmed also started barking loudly, right into the faces of Jewls’s friends. The bell rang. They stopped as abruptly as they began. Shrieking with laughter, they backed off. 

Jewls and their friends stared at each other, disoriented. “What the fuck was that all about?” 

Jonathan, a slight bespectacled boy who used to be Susan shrugged. “It’s a new way.”

It continued. In between every class, Ryan’s gang would surround Jewls and their friends, barking, barely touching them. Whenever they saw them outside class, they barked, and sometimes meowed, doubling up with laughter. 

The effect on Jewls friend group was harsh. It was better than physical violence, to be sure, but they were powerless against the barking, and teachers simply shrugged. 

It must have been ten days after Tish’s death. The barking routine had not become boring. Ryan and his friends swarmed them as soon as they stepped in the hallway, and began barking, even throwing their heads back and howling. 

Jewls screamed at them to stop it, fuck off. The other kids, sensing a fight circled them, their eyes shining. 

Jonathan doubled over and began vomiting, prompting shrieks and a stampede from larger crowd, pushing him into his own barf. He slipped as he tried to get up and fell down again. The crowd of schoolkids seemed to swell and hold him down. He felt a sudden weight and a snap in his leg. It wasn’t an accident, through his tears of pain and fear, he had spotted Ahmed stamp on his leg. He couldn’t get up and knew he would die. 

Tish moved effortlessly through the crowd, kneeled by his head, and held him close, protecting him. He could smell her cheap Body Shop perfume they had nicked from the mall together. The crowd passed over him. He breathed in her perfume, and the pain lessened. 

He was going to be ok."

Dad skipped the ceremony, obviously, since everybody knew he was the one who murdered her. Showing his face would have just been disrespectful.

My big sister, Ruth, took the lead instead. She gave a real heartfelt speech, one that moved everybody to tears. Not that we weren’t there already. And then she told me to toss a handful of acorns on mom’s body so an oak tree would grow to mark her place.

From then on, it was just the two of us.

Dad never answered for his crime, even though the sheriff knew *exactly* what happened. I imagine he was secretly relieved to finally get some relief. I still remember hiding under the bed with Ruth night after night, her dialling 9-1-1 on the rotary phone while I prayed for the fighting to stop, both completely terrified.

Throughout the next forty years, I occasionally heard about my father’s drunken escapades out West. I should really sign up to one of those DNA sites sometime—I’ve probably got two dozen half-siblings out there.

It was a little after Ruth’s fifty-seventh birthday when she got the diagnosis. Brain cancer. The kind you don’t recover from. And even then, dad still didn’t reach out. Bastard wouldn’t even call the hospital.

So imagine my surprise when he turned up one sunny afternoon, completely outta the blue, hat in hands. In a complete state of shock, I brought him inside and made a pot of coffee.

He said he regretted his past actions: all the missed birthdays, the endless drunken rows, and not visiting Ruth during her final hours.

But above all, he said he regretted what he’d done to my mother.

I asked if he’d like to see the memorial I’d built for her. He said he’d like that a lot.

I took him out into the yard. In the spot where we buried mom, a tall oak tree now stood. And as dad dropped to his knees and cried, the tips of branches began to creep forward. One poked his shoulder; another jabbed his neck. He whipped his head up and batted them away, wearing a puzzled expression.

Roots ripped from the ground and searched for dad’s torso. When he tried to run, one coiled around his ankles and slowly reeled him back, inch by inch. And then he was hoisted into the air as tree limbs enveloped his wrists.

Dad screamed, but not for long, because a crooked branch—thicker and longer than an amputated arm—shot through his back and out his chest. He gave an air-choked groan, then blood came out of his mouth in a fat spurt.

In the underside of the trunk, I’d nailed up a shelf at waist height. Resting on top was a framed photo of Ruth, my mother, and me. All three of us were smiling. And as I hugged it tight branches bent down, so the leaves could warm me like bird feathers.

I love you mom."
r26x72,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r26x72/gasping/,Gasping,49,9,1637875664.0,"Gasping.

Just a single word, but it truly does convey the desperation in the speaker's comment. 'gasping for a cig' or 'gasping for a drink'. Both addictions, things your brain has literally rewired itself to need, to crave. Things you don't feel you could possibly live without, that you could not possibly take another step forwards or say another word until the incessant, almost insidious in its nature, craving is sated.

The word itself is harsh, sudden. The main consonants are both plosives; g and p. They physically stop the speaker's breath. You hear the word, and it's weight screams out at you.  You hear someone tell you that they are gasping, and the need is almost passed on to you - the innocent bystander. It's spat out, rather than verbalized.

You'll find yourself scrabbling - for a cigarette, maybe, or a stiff drink. You don't know why, but you understand. People can tell you they are gasping for something, and it just stops the conversation. All momentum is lost. The need is just, blatantly clear.

Someone telling you that they are gasping for something almost creates a snapshot in time, a tableau. It's the click of the camera. But also, the flick of a lighter, the clink of ice in a glass followed by the soft slosh of whatever follows. And only once the speaker has continued talking, or sighs that breath of relief that only ever follows  nicotine flooding a bloodstream, only then will the freeze-frame become alive again. Sound surges back in to the world and forward movement can continue.

When she met him, he was everything. Her moon, controlling the beats of her heart like the tides. The blood in her veins, the flush in her cheeks and, she thought, the skip in her step. Her friends would gush, tell her how lucky she was to have a man like him. Someone who, in a room full of people, would watch only her.

Soon, sooner than she would have ever thought possible, she could tell. He would walk in the door with a bunch of flowers, a box of chocolates. The dress she had been admiring as he watched her on her phone, or a takeaway in hand so she wouldn't have to cook again. He would envelop her in his arms.

She would kiss him, stroking the hair atop the skull that had given her countless concussions. She would kneel in front of the sofa, taking shoes off the feet that had broken her ribs, her wrists. She would kiss the hands that blackened her eyes, pulled her hair out in clumps.

But if he walked in and told her he was gasping for a drink, her hands would tremble and suddenly she forgot how to walk. She broke a few glasses, but it was only the first time he made her walk over the broken glass. After that, breaking a glass would reduce her to a crying mess on the floor. Her legs would stop knowing they were meant to hold her up. Still, she would take him his drink.

It was only as his hands gripped around her neck, as her eyesight began to fade out in dark spots hovering between them, she truly realised the significance of the word gasping."

We were very close from like, forever. But, a new girl came in our class, let's say she's called Diane. 

Diane was sweet and we three got along, but she started taking Amanda for herself and leaving me behind. After a long battle with myself, I finally let them go. But, as we were in the same class, it was hard. I was always behind them. I always felt like that, I always found myself standing right behind them. 

It had been hard, yes. I had tried my best to get over it. But then, I remembered everything. About every day Amanda used to talk about how awful Diane was, how narcissistic, selfish etc. And I just felt like I couldn't let my BFF with someone so toxic. So awful. Wasn't it my duty, as a friend, to help her? 

So I taught Diane how to behave. I made her go through so many lessons. It had taken so long! But, finally, it worked. 

Though, I was dissapointed when Amanda came to my call and was so sad. I asked her what's wrong and she kept calling me a monster, sick and all kinds of names.
She kept her eyes locked to the body in front of her, still alive, but barely breathing. Barely the woman she was. She was full of scars, of blood, and even parts missing. Like her eyes. I knew Amanda wouldn't understand, but everything had a reason behind. 

I could go all day about meanings, but I couldn't get over Amanda's scream as she tried to get Diane and leave, but Diane just fell on the ground, and fell so hard that the last drops of blood she had left were gone. She was dead, for sure. Sitting in a pool of her own blood, with parts missing, and being just a body, nothing more. 

I smiled and looked at Amanda and told her how much I missed her and that Diane was so toxic, she needed to be a better person. I told her how I took the role as a teacher for Diane, and she was very responsive. She should've been proud. However, Amanda didn't listen. Instead, she called me names, again, and an asshole, then said I was the one who caused Diane's death. 

But, I don't agree. Amanda was the one that let her fall. It was her fault Diane fell and died. 

So, Reddit, what do you think? Am I the asshole?"

I didn't even hear my attacker before my face had already smacked the cold pavement with a thud. It took several seconds for me to realise I'd been attacked and several more to realise I was bleeding. I couldn't even feel it at first, I *smelled* it as wherever I'd been cut leaked a puddle of liquid iron that stretched all of the way to my face.

""Jesus Christ! Miss! *Miss!*"" I heard someone yell.

Someone flipped me to my back and a handsome face floated out of the darkness. He put pressure on the wound and it finally hurt. My mysterious saviour ripped his shirt and bandaged me with it in a way I thought people did in movies.

""I'll call the police, they can get officers out here and get you to a hospital.""

*Hospital? I can't afford that.*

I shook my head at him with difficulty.

""No police? Okay... who should I call then? Partner? Parents?""

I tried to laugh but it came out more as a splutter.

""I can't leave you here miss. Look, if you can walk then let me take you to my place. It isn't far.""

I was in no real position to argue and so we stumbled along to his apartment. The man finally introduced himself, David. He cleaned me up nicely and made me toast and a cup of bright blue tea that he told me was butterfly pea flowers.

""This is the spare room. Stay as long as you like, I mean that.""


I stayed two weeks without any incident. It might seem crazy but the first day I was in no shape to go home, the second I could have been alone but with difficulty and the following days I realised I liked being cared for. David's offer to stay as long as I wanted was genuine and he was a perfect gentleman.

Last night though I heard strange noises when half asleep and though I thought it was only dreams I still went to David's room today to check it out. A woman lay in his bed, alive but cut up horrendously. Aside from the gore there was something *strange* about this picture and I didn't realise what until David found me there.

""Why is she smiling?"" I spluttered.

""I want them to be happy."" He replied, gesturing to the blue tea on the nightstand. ""The first drug I made caused their happiness to rely upon me hurting them though, and I didn't like that either. So I tweaked it and now they'll be happy no matter what I do to them.""

""You were going to do this to me?!""

David sighed.

""No dear. I needed to make sure this new batch worked with or without pain. If you hadn't found this then I would have had no reason to hurt you.""

A switchblade came out of his pocket with practiced speed as he approached me.

It had the same Autumn-colored bouquets, sweet-smelling candles and, of course, the bountiful feast that my classmates and schoolteacher enjoyed. There were traditions my family just did differently; like my unreasonably early bedtime those nights, and the strange symbols that adorned our decorations. Other than the emphasis on my grandfather’s old cornucopia, our gathering passed much the same as everyone’s, I presumed. 

My grandfather led the annual prayer before our meal, though it was in a dialect I never understood. I normally bowed my head and closed my eyes, but when I was nine, I only pretended to. Through squinted eyelids, my family mirrored my posture, but with their arms outstretched toward the centerpiece. At the head of the table stood my grandfather, a man of considerable physique despite his age. Through a full gray beard he prayed, his left arm raised and right hand placed on the cornucopia before him. 

It was so different from the ones I’d seen in pictures or at my elementary school. There was nothing wicker-basket about it. Both overflowed with fruit and flowers, but the similarities ended there. My grandfather’s cornucopia was a genuine bull horn - colored by spirals of gray, silver and black, and with a luster from every lit candle that made it seem alive. The tip and end were encrusted with gold filigree, and it always took the most prominent table position, no matter the size or beauty of our feast. 

At last, the prayer ended, the banquet joined, and, after much laughter and revelry, it was already time for bed. It wasn’t until I was tucked in that I noticed my thirst, and that I forgot to sip that dark-red, funny-tasting drink I always enjoyed. The house was empty and quiet, though out the window I saw cars filling our driveway and light coming from the empty barn out back. Compelled to investigate, I ignored my nervous bladder, and stepped out onto the frosty, dead leaves. 

With each step the strange sound of singing, laughing, and a sort of chant grew louder. Through the wall cracks I saw movement inside, but what I saw when I came to a gap in the closed door sent my nine-year-old mind reeling. 

My grandfather stood in the center of the barn next to a large, stone tub, the horn lifted over his head. He and all the revelers were naked, and the others danced as they watched him plunge the horn into the tub with a splash. The horn stood erect for a moment as the surface bubbled. Then it rose and turned, attached to the head and body of a Minotaur-looking beast. Cheers erupted and I swooned, pushing the door open and falling to the dirt floor. In silence, strange and familiar faces stared at me, but it was the look from those oval, bovine eyes that finally sent the spinning world to darkness."

A deep chuckle emanated from the being I'd come to see as death; the end of all things. 

""It was a gift; a fleeting one, at that. And you spent half of it in search of me."" It spoke. 

I thought on those words for a time. There was no rush to find value in them. And for the first time, in as long as I could remember, I rested. 

And in and within the End, I knew that the destination I had reached would never had changed. Only the means to which I had taken to arrive. 

""I'd like to do it all again..."" I spoke. 

A knowing smile crept upon his face. This time, we both knew I'd do it right."

Being poor, you don’t have the luxury of living where you want. My mould infested walls are a constant reminder of how poor my life is. Colonies of black mildew live and breathe on every wall in my flat, and no matter how much I paint over it, it sprouts back to life blacker and smellier than ever. 

The mould comes alive at night. I watch it grow and move like a winding snake across my walls and ceilings. Sometimes I lie awake at night watching the walls heave as if it’s taking a deep breath. Most days, I feel smothered from the spores that travel throughout the rooms, looking for a spot to infest. The constant chest infections leave me too tired to get out of bed most days. 

For the past week, I’ve had this constant headache made worse by my neighbours upstairs. I’m sure it’s a couple and their kids. I’ve heard the kids crying and the adults fighting over the mould in their flat. I’ve passed them on the stairs before, and they seemed like a sweet family. The ceiling in my flat rocked when they fought, but it stopped suddenly a few days ago, and now all you hear is this constant thumping sound. Every few hours, like clockwork, something drags itself across the floor. 

I muster up what energy I can and take my throbbing headache to go and confront the couple. The air is thick with mould spores as I make my way up the stairs to the next floor. My lungs burn with each breathe I take. I struggle up the stairs, each step zapping what energy I have until suddenly everything goes black. 

I wake up at the top of the stairs, covered in mould. The all-consuming black stench of decay permeated the air. I feel a tickle on my feet as the mould infested floor tries to make me a part of it. I burst through the couple's door only to be overcome by the smell of death. Something had died in here, but I couldn’t tell because a thick, black slime covered every inch of the flat. I nervously walk into what looks like one of the bedrooms. I gag as the smell of death gets stronger. A big mass of heaving slime sits in the corner of the room. I recoil in horror when I spot a child’s leg being sucked back into black sludge. 

On the couch in front of what used to be the tv sits the figure of a man, consumed by the same mould that took his family. As I peer into the man's lifeless eyes, he suddenly springs to life, sending me flying across the room. He lets a desperate moan before dropping back down dead. 

The mould had consumed their bodies before the authorities arrived at the flat. Nobody believes me. Feeling too tired to do anything else, I lie here waiting for the mould to take me too."

I live where I work as to keep costs low.  Most of the first floor is dedicated to the business, while the second floor is my home.  My large eat in kitchen happens to be the one room that didn't make sense to relocate to the upstairs.  So, every Thanksgiving for the past three years, I wheel my guests into my kitchen where we set at the table and enjoy our feast. 

This year was no different.  I had a little bit of a grease fire while cooking, but that was quickly extinguished and the rest of the night went quite well.  All of the guests got along with one another as usual.  It's amazing how nicely people will treat one another when they know it's their last meal.  That, and I try to make something that everyone truly enjoys. 

""This cranberry sauce is fantastic,"" Mildred exclaimed. 

""I haven't had cornbread like this since I was a child, thank you,"" Bob muttered while still chewing. 

""I can't remember the last time that I had a home cooked meal like this,"" J. Doe stated. 

""That smells delicious,"" a voice glowed from around the corner. 

""Mark?"" 

He stepped in and it really was it was my husband, Mark.  This has never happened before. 

""Oh my god, Mark!""  I shouted as I ran to him.  I put my arms around him and he was, real.  He was really here.  I could feel him.  I could smell him.  I wanted to hold him forever. 

""But, how?""  I asked looking up to him. 

He nodded to my plate and I looked down.  Along with the rest of the food that I had placed on my plate, my mom's stuffing rested between my turkey and mashed potatoes.  I haven't made her stuffing since Mark had passed.  He loved it as well and it just hurt too much. 

""Mom?"" I stated as my eyes began to well with tears. 

Then it hit me.  I looked to the rest of the kitchen.  Then I ran to the windows, just as the fire trucks turned the corner."

It all started on the second day of our stay, I woke up in the crimson painted guestroom and saw a silver tray loaded with the breakfast we were going to eat, my parents were already sitting at the bronze dining table and had started eating. A little later I sat down with them and started eating my food as they told me that we were going to visit the sanctuary of Olympia.

had heard that the ancient Greeks made various sacrifices to the gods there and although I was eager to go there,suddenly we all felt unwell and went to sleep. While falling asleep I thought I heard a voice outside the door of our room :""did you put it in their food?""

When I woke up at night I looked around, I saw with horror that I was tied with a wire to a tree, in front of me I could see people wearing white coats and disguised with theatrical masks dancing in a circle holding  torches in their hands and coming towards me.

I heard one of them saying to me ""thank you for visiting our hotel, we will make sure you become a sacrifice to the gods and have a decent grave"", as I heard these words I tried to escape from my shackles but I could not, and when I looked around my parents were put on fire tied in two other trees, I looked up and from a black cloud that had formed above me  emerged a black hand with octopus tentacles instead of fingers coming towards me.

""Gods, we offer this scapegoat with gratitude for what you did for us and the miracles you performed for us"", one of them said as he brought his torch closer and closer to me ..."

""How about this... There are some sorta space pirates who enter in earth's atmosphere. The military fights with fiercely leading to crash landing. The world is saved. Their space ship blows up! No trace left behind. Vanished.""

The Director snorted. ""Sounds like same other hollywood movie.""

Fuck. I said to myself.

""...All just a practical joke?"" one of the Assistant Directors asked. ""And who will design a replica space ship to pull it off? Who'd believe that?""

The silence swept across.

""...It could be a movie set.... Maybe they just stumbled in on the making of some sci-fi flick.....It can be a confusion all along. Funny and witty."" the youngest and most inexperienced assistant suggested.

Damn. That was a nice idea.

The director snorted. ""Oh, Please!? We aren't making a sitcom here.""

The room fell silent...again, except for the tapping of the second unit director's fingers drumming on the top of the conference table.

""Nothing?"" the Director asked, looking around the room. ""No one has a creative idea?""

The others stared at each other, but no one spoke.

The Director sighed and got up from the table. He walked over to the small door at the far end of the room and pressed a button. A steel window block shot up and we could see the >!captive humans!< in the chamber beyond.

Normal bad boys ride motorcycles or get tattoos or try to party harder than Motley Crue did in the '80s.

I mean, Jamie did all that too, but it gets worse.

When he was 16, Jamie had found a rare old grimoire and summoned something he couldn't banish.

It was a dumb thing to do. Everyone knows you need to learn banishing and protective circles BEFORE you even think about learning how to summon.

But he seemed like a sweet guy, so I let it slide.

After a few months, he started acting weird. When it spiraled into gaslighting and abuse, I knew I had to get away.

I'll never know who the ""real"" Jamie was. Was he a sweet guy whose resident demon influenced him to misbehave, or was he just an asshole who happened to be permanently possessed?

I waited until he went out of town to break it off. He didn't take it well, but since I moved and changed my number that same day, I wasn't worried.

Breakups are hard, and I was lonely. I petitioned Lilith for a genuinely sweet and loyal boy who would always love me.

A couple of months later, my roommate Allie rescued a little stray tabby cat, and she had kittens. One of them was BIG for a kitten, purred like a motorcycle, and always wanted to play with me. I named him Harley.

Who needs a boyfriend when you've got a cat who watches music videos with you, cuddles you to sleep every night, and is always happy to see you? Sure, Harley was destructive, loud, and had unusually coarse fur, but so what? I stopped looking for a new man. I didn't need one.

The police showed up at our door one day. They said Jamie had broken into my old apartment and severely beaten the new tenant, looking for me. I declined protective custody because they didn't want me to bring Harley.

I was coming home a few days later when *Jamie boarded the same train car.* He tried to grab me, but I escaped just before the door closed and the train pulled away. 

When Allie got home, we cast a protective circle, and there was a squad car outside, but I was still pretty frightened. Harley cuddled right up to me and purred until I fell asleep.

I normally woke up to Harley purring right next to my ear. The next morning, Harley was sitting on the floor, washing his paws. 

Allie had the morning news on in the living room. ""...the mangled body found by hikers in Griffith Park two hours ago is confirmed to be that of James Preston, wanted on multiple criminal charges...""

I slowly realized that Harley's white feet looked unusually...pinkish. And there were faint reddish paw prints on the floor. 

I picked up Harley and gave him the biggest hug. He started purring.

""Good boy, Harley. Good boy."""

It took his parents 2 hours to finally get him to sleep. And as the night passed on the boy dreamed, he dreamed of toys, of candy and of the tasty dinner he’ll get tomorrow. 

But his dream was interrupted by some sudden thumps on the roof. The boy shot awake with the excitement of it being Christmas Day. His excitement soon dissipated when he saw his clock, and it was only 3:00 am. But then there were more thumps on the roof. He thought to himself “Santa!” As he slowly got out of bed trying to make no noise he heard the thumps moving down to his living room.

Suddenly he got a nasty smell, if death had a smell, this is it. Scared he made his way downstairs thinking “Santa will make it leave” only to be met by a tall, hunched, furry creature with horns. The smell came from him. The creature turned around, there was a shout and Jessie was never to be seen again."

A harsh winter came down from the mountains, gripping our hearts and stealing our harvest. The people of Fjalir took shelter in the longhouse as a new threat wandered on the wind.

The giants came from far north, beckoned by the echoes of man. Treading down saplings in their haste. Snapping trees as strong as Fenrir's chains for their clubs. We heard their bellows of hatred and hunger echo off Fjalir's high craggy cliffs. But we did not falter. 

With my brother's and sisters we fought the first wave in the ice banks north of our settlement. The snow, with Tyr's blessing, gave us an advantage. Some fell, cracking the ground and gorging out hollows of earth in their demise. Rivers of blood stained the land. 

To honour our gods and to strike fear into the giants we climbed on the back of one and opened his back. The skin was tough and thick, but we craved out its ribs, snapping them back in the ritual of the blood eagle. So those that dared to attack again would see what would happen to their kin. 

But, our gods are cruel and fickle. As we thanked Odin and sang of our victory another, unseen wave attacked from behind. Fjalir screamed in the agony. Fire raged as the beast smashed down our homes and tore apart our families. 

I'm not ashamed to say I felt fear crawl up my spine. They came up the mountainside in droves, craving deep gouges out of the land with their hands. The ravens circled above. A great swathes of black against the grey skies. Our Völva commanded them to kill. And they did. Pecking out the giant's eyes as they came for us. 

Victory seemed to pass through us like iced water. 

The blood eagle rose. 

The crack of its bones echoed around us as the giant stood. The bones of its rips sprayed out like wings. 

""To Valhalla!"" The cry went up.

We attacked again. My kin raced across the land like ants. Drones of us welding axe and blade. But they kept coming. Everyone we cut down rose again. It was only when we managed to take the head off one that it stopped moving. I didn't know what black magick was at work. 

The blood eagle snared Alviss, a thick armed farmer. The beast tore off his head with his teeth and ripped off his arms like jerky. Madness seeped into my mind. The berserker rage tinged the world red. 

I heard the rage spread. Carried on the wind. The ravens came back, pecking out eyes and gorging faces. The last of us attacked as the giants were distracted. When the rage left my limbs weak and my mind addled, it was to the eerie quiet of the mountains. 

They had been stopped. Twenty giants laid headless. The snow drifted down covering clubs and backs. 

But that was disturbed when my kin rose from the dead."

“Hey Scar, how are you?”  
  
“I’m great thanks for asking!”  
  
“Well, I saw that you you called me.”

“Well, alright, if that’s it…” I trailed off, half-expecting her to mention something else, but after about 10 seconds, I checked my phone and it showed that she had hung up.  
  
Not thinking much of it, I finished my breakfast, grabbed the keys to my car, and headed off to work. Of course, my gas tank was almost empty, and while on another day I might have risked it, I really wasn’t in the mood to have to roll my car off to the side of the road until I got some oil, so I fueled it up at the 7-Eleven right where my street met the main road. After that, I rolled out to work.  
  
It was basically an average day, except for Rick living up to his name a little more than usual and Marg seeming a little more tired than usual, but who could blame her?  
  
After pushing through and getting out of that palace of fluorescent lights, I tossed my keys on the counter and sank into my couch, and I flicked on the T.V. I mindlessly swept through the pages of shows and movies, not really expecting to watch any of them, but as I passed some movie with Chris Hemsworth, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  
  
The instantly recognizable yellow and blue of Scarlett’s wallet.  
  
More confused than shocked, I picked up my phone and went to call her, but before I did that, I went to listen to her voicemail. With a preemptive squeeze of dread in my stomach, I pressed play, and I almost jumped because of the volume of the message being yelled at me by the almost unrecognizable, yet oh-so-familiar voice in my phone.
  
“REKHA! SEND HELP! PLEASE! SOMETHING’S IN HERE! IT’S LOOKING FOR ME!” and then an absolutely blood-curdling scream."

I’m sure you’re busy whipping up magic in your kitchens, but do you ever get to a point when you just think, this is enough? In fact, it’s too much?

Confession time: I am feeling a little overwhelmed myself! We invited DH’s parents over for Thanksgiving. (DH stands for Dear Husband, for those of you not familiar with the lingo, like Bradley himself. He said it was “stupid” to refer to him as DH and I said hey, it works for Dead Husband too, ha ha. We kid!)

Believe it or not this is actually the first year his parents have come over to ours! Usually his mom makes the whole Thanksgiving dinner. “Deb,” I always say. “I’m a food blogger. Let me bring a side!” (Her name isn’t actually Deb, but she said she would be “mortified” if I used her real name because she’s “embarrassed” to be associated with me and my blog. “Not that you have any readers anyway.” We kid!)

But this year my FIL (that’s father-in-law, Bradley, Jesus, it’s not rocket science) just absolutely insisted that they come over to our house for the big day. Pretty flattering, I’d say!

I saw the email FIL sent to Bradley: “\[Deb\] always makes such a big production out of how much work it is to cook for Thanksgiving and I’m sick of hearing her bitch. Maybe that wife of yours can make herself useful with her little hobby.” (Fun fact, FIL, my blog has tripled its views this year, more than I can say for your loser son’s company!)

“If she was really such a good cook she’d shut up about it and let her food do the talking. In my day, recipes were for the family. My mother went to her grave with her orange-peel cake recipe a secret.”

(Confession time: I was snooping on Bradley’s email. Naughty, naughty. Coal in the stocking for me!)

(Confession #2: I’ve had Bradley’s grandmother’s orange-peel cake. It sucks!)

I know what you’re thinking: Just get to the recipe already! Well, I was pressed for time today because you-know-who’s parents showed up for dinner two hours early and then complained about the wait. Drama ensued! But I have a minute, because the “boys” dozed off in the den with football and whiskey. (I added a little something extra to their drinks!) “Deb” was trickier, but I fixed that bathroom door that sometimes gets stuck, and now it always gets stuck.

The polished calm female voice from the Diversity, Inclusion and Equity Training module seemed to trigger a painful physical reaction in Brian.

He stared at a  graphic of smiling black and brown and pink faces on his work computer screen and his brain twitched. He reached for his personal cellphone and started typing out a message in his private SapTap group. “Guys they finally made me do it- HR said they’d put a note in my file and I just can’t deal with this bullshit anymore. What a load of crap. Jesus Christ as if these…”

As the female voice from the Module moved on to the Unit about microagressions, Brian’s tapping into his SapTap group chat became more frenzied and unprintable.

*“Please select the answer which best fits the description of a Microagression:*

*1- Complimenting a female colleague on her hair style;*

*2-Asking an Asian colleague to solve a math problem;*

*3- Asking a colleague to move their car as it is blocking yours.”*

Brian’s computer scanned his furious face and used that data to calculate that the DIE Training is produced a spiralling adverse reaction in him, kickstarting the algorithm for solving the problem of the UnTrainables.

A hundred upturned faces of freshly-hired onboarding employees watched in horror on the big screen as Brian gasped, dropped his phone, gripped his chest, and convulsed in agony in front of his workstation.

The real DIE Trainer, a mild-mannered racially and gender-ambiguous person of indeterminate age and rather raspy voice, paused the video presentation and turned to the trainee group.

“You see, we have calculated the cost of dealing with people like Brian, the Untrainables as they are known. The cost is too high compared to the benefits of keeping them on and trying to program them into accepting modern social norms. You can find the figures and the formulae used on page 36 of your workbook. What you just saw was a demonstration of the latest technology installed in our computers, in which the Untrainables are simply eliminated from the workforce. This frees up our resources and makes space for workers who are more malleable and less prone to toxic ideology. The same page has the final number on how much this technology is saving us in dollars and cents. Now. Let’s see, in the next Unit, we will cover how to gauge and measure Cultural Competence and Humility. Would anybody like to offer an example of Cultural Humility in the Workplace?

Nobody said anything. The professor sighed, turned to his screen, and started the next Module."

My other hand is fumbling for my sunglasses. It was dark when I went in there, but now it's blinding, and freezing, and all I can smell is rubbing alcohol radiating off my face.

I have thirteen zombie prosthetics glued to my head, and because of this my sunglasses won't fit on, so I retreat behind the two-bangers in the shade to light my smoke. I'm snapping my fingers and humming a song, not thinking about the medical adhesive that's coating my face, neck, and shoulders. “Telesis,” it’s called, and they say it’s safe, although it smells very suspicious, and God only knows what happens when telesis is mixed with acetone and alcohol and all the other stuff.

I had some coffee in the makeup trailer, and some Advil before that. All I have to do now is keep the coffee and Advil flowing and lurch around like a demonic brain-eater until I'm wrapped. Sometimes stunt work is easy, although hitting the ground always sucks. There's always a new rock to smack your head on, everywhere you fall.

I can't wash my hands because the makeup will rub off, so I creep behind the two-bangers (which are the bathroom trucks) into the shadows to smoke. Before I get there I see Todd walking in the cold, and I smile, raising a painted hand, fuming fingertips mirage-wavering in the morning sun. But he doesn't see me, so I go behind the two-bangers and stick the cigarette back in my face, pushing my fake, webby hair back and out of the way. New Years is only three days away, and I have big plans to quit smoking because it’s something I hate doing, even though I enjoy doing it sometimes, but it’s been too long, and the line for cancer is getting shorter every day. But that’s three days from now; plenty of time for smoking.

I flick my lighter, and my whole head goes up like a landmine. Three hours of hard work, with my head inside and I'm screaming, running in spasmodic circles. My head is a geyser of fire, and when it settles the silicone mask has melted to my face, twisting it into an expression that isn't my own.

No one can see what's happening to me because I'm behind the two-bangers. I remember hitting the ground, a rock finding my head of course, and I'm trying to rip off my mask, but it's fused to my face. Instead, I'm pulling my forehead off, my hands boiling, and I can't tell what's the mask and what's my face. It's clumping in my hands, and I'm looking at my eyebrows, and then my eyes roll back because I'm trying to scream. . .

And that's the last thing I remember, really.

It's funny, I don't want a cigarette anymore."

It was the morning of Alex’s fiftieth birthday, so naturally, he was to die before next sunrise. 

&#x200B;

He was as sure of this as his father, Ethan Cole Hutton (1944-1994), had been, after having witnessed the timely death of his very own father, Malcom “Moe” Hutton (1922-1972) from a single white cloud, whirring around with electricity against the unbroken blue of one Sunday afternoon, leaving Mass.

&#x200B;

His dearest -departed- brother, Ethan Cole Jr. (1961-2011) had found himself with a somewhat violent fit of coughing one particular morning. He was to be pronounced dead eight hours later when an unknown, faceless driver momentarily diverted his attention elsewhere, just as Jr. crossed 81st Street on his daily commute to work.

&#x200B;

So now, with countless generations of pianos falling over their heads, of losing their footing in the shower, of stumbling down stairs, of plane crashes and car crashes and one horse involving uncle Ned (1946-1996), Alex waited in a room, by himself.

&#x200B;

It was only 09:00 so far, which meant he’d already made it longer than his great-grandfather Zackariah Corban Hutton (1886-1936), who, challenging death, locked himself in the basement, only for a nearby stream to overflow and drown him. Maybe, he thought to himself, fiddling with the gun on his lap, tickling its trigger, he’d live long enough to see the sun set.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

He got up -his back hurting from sitting on that chair since the day before. He wasn't dying on his ass, that much he knew. With his free hand, he massaged at his lower back, grunting with satisfaction at the slight pain.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

Maybe cancer; an overzealous cell, floating through his veins, through his body, touching his heart, his liver, his lungs, planting tumors in each and every organ, corrupting entire systems at a time.

&#x200B;

Maybe, he thought, going up and down the room, nervously checking on the four walls about him. Checking they hadn't moved-in an inch closer when he wasn't looking.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

He laughed aloud, acknowledging how ridiculous the scenario. Moving walls. If anything, it would be the entire building plummeting on him; crushing, him.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

Or maybe, he thought, stopping at the idea.

&#x200B;

The gun.

&#x200B;

Maybe he’d save himself the trouble and simply off himself, then and there. No accidents, no mishaps, no unfortunate turn of events to define his exit from this life.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

He sat down, one last time, and pulled out a carton of cigarettes from his shirt pocket. It was funny, none of the warnings for rotting teeth and dripping IV machines scared him now, they lost all meaning. What gives, was his final thought, I’m about to die anyways. Holding the cigarette between his lips, he lit a match.

Out of the forty-five tenants living in apartment block C, there was only a single reported fatality from the ensuing gas leak explosion, with a handful of shaken survivors.

Alex Mast Hutton (1971-2021) is survived by his wife, Nicole Freeman Hutton (1968-living), and son Edgar James Hutton (1999-living)."

Even in a seller’s market, the name Paquaset Hills was a hard sell for some. Of course, there was no truth to the rumors. The burial site that prickled her neckhairs was four miles south, a protected site in the state for the better part of a decade. She wouldn’t have cared for that contradictory truth though. 

“Next,” she said, eying our pricer offers with a sort of forlorn contempt. 

“Well, there is one Craftsman for sale out in Long Pines.”  I showed her the brochure. 20k below the other comps on the market. 

“And I ain’t gonna get scalped by some squaw ghost with a grudge?”

I swallowed a proper response and went with, “nope.”

She smiled, seeing the price. “You know, you’re alright for an Arab.”

I’m Bengali. Hindu. Born and raised in Maryland, but to get rid of her and her silently leering son, I left my response at. “Uh-huh…*Shukran*.”

Three weeks later she moved in. I deposited my commission and I sent her a welcome basket—a box of surgical masks, a World Atlas and a history of India. She never asked why the house was so cheap and mine isn’t a state where you have to disclose a murder on the property. In all fairness though, the house was a complete gut and reno about two years prior. It looked nothing like it had on the nightly news. 

Still, I kept tabs on the house. I Googled Addie and John-Paul Perkins frequently. They didn’t sell and six whole months passed without incident. The incident though…

The names finally popped during the summer. Addie Perkins was found without her arms.  Apparently, she had tried to wriggle into a laundry chute like some legs-only snake, and ran face-first into a dormant hornet’s nest. Tight fucking fit. 

Her son got it worse. He had gotten locked in the basement and had snagged his toe on a nail. The news had been vague on the details but said that a part of him stayed on that nail and the rest of his skin unraveled like yarn from a sweater. He had written something in the dark, on the floor, in his own blood. 

*LET IT END*

If I know my brother, well, he wasn’t one to half-ass.

The Perkinses didn’t recognize me. I had been a kid the last time we crossed paths. I poured my heart out on the witness stand, but in the end, the jury came to voluntary manslaughter. Forty-seven months. 

Addie had been concerned about living in Paquaset Hills, but after she and her son killed my brother in his own home, they dug a hole in the backyard. I’d like to think that they got the irony in the end, moving into his former home, near an *Indian* burial ground of their own making. But I’ll settle on a restless bhut moving on to rebirth."

Except instead of lizards, it's turkeys. I found proof, hard proof, about this. Now they're after me and our family. I'll explain more when we're safe, but we have to go.""

She stares at you, eyebrows raised. You grab both of her hands and take them into yours.

""I know this sounds absolutely insane, but it's the truth,” you continue. “If our marriage means anything to you, if our daughter's life means anything to you, then please do as I say and pack your bags.”

She opens her mouth to speak-

**BANG**

You watch as your wife slumps face down on the floor. Blood pours out from the bullet wound on the back of her head.

You look behind you and see a man holding a revolver. His eyes are fixated on your wife's lifeless body.

“You have betrayed us,” he says. His eyes turn to you. He steps closer. He's one of them.

You tackle him to the ground. With great difficulty, you wrestle the weapon out from his grasp. You stand up and shoot him in the chest until the gun clicks empty.

You catch your breath. Looking around your home and at the bodies lying on the floor amid your baby's cries, you begin to weep.

Six months have passed and now you're in a motel. You've been running and hiding the entire time, never staying in one place more than necessary. You want to fight, you want to expose this terrible secret to the world, but you don't know where to begin. You know from your research that the turkey people hold considerable influence. They're almost everywhere, from the highest levels of power to the common people around you.

You turn your attention to your daughter. Despite the difficulty of raising a child alone while mourning your wife, your baby has been the only source of stability in your life. You decide to prepare her for bed.

You're changing her clothes when you find a small black feather embedded on her arm. You find another on her shoulder, and three more on her back. The skin on her feet has hardened, almost like scales. Her toes, once plump and round, are now as sharp and pointed as talons. Your mind begins to race, but your thoughts are interrupted by your daughter's first words

How could a simple hike go so wrong? I'm almost out of food the snow is my only water source. I know I'm being followed by something I can hear it. Luckily, I found this cabin, it offers some sense of security. But it's the voices that scare me the most. Voices of people who are gone from my life. I hear Rob who took a bullet in Afghanistan, I hear Krista who left with our daughter. All of them are closing in on me, ""What did you do!!"" I hear Krista yell. I didn't mean to do it, I just lost control I'm not myself anymore since I came home I just blackout and wake up somewhere else. 

Day 6 or 7 I think: I saw Krista standing outside the cabin, she stared at me with pure rage I tried to look away, but I would always look back. She was closer her face just a few feet from the window. She opened her mouth and what came out was the cry of an infant. I covered my ears, ""IT WASN'T MY FAULT!!! I DIDN'T MEAN TO!!!"" I shouted. I heard knocking at the door. It sounded like Rob was on the other side, ""Joe? you alright buddy."" I know that wasn't Rob he died in my arms after getting shot in the neck. ""Let me in and we can talk things over."" I crawled into a ball and ignored him.  I heard Krista’s voice coming from the bedroom window, ""Joseph, come talk to me don’t shut me out.” 

Day Unknown: I heard the baby today, she's safe with her mom why if she is coming after me. I wasn't the best father, but I tried, my temper was never the best, but the war just keeps playing in my mind again. She was my whole world I would never hurt her. She knows that. I’m opening the door maybe we can work something out

NEWS REPORTER: Today we are getting new reports on the murder case of Krista Landen and her infant daughter. Two weeks ago, a family friend reported them as missing. Police then entered the home only to find both Krista and her daughter died from blunt force trauma. The prime suspect is Krista Landen's Husband Joseph. Joseph Landen is a recently discharged veteran from Afghanistan. Friends and family noted that Joseph’s behavior had become increasingly erratic and tried to get him help. It is believed that Krista tried to leave as investigators found multiple bags packed. However, the case seems to be winding down as Joseph's body was in a cabin deep in the woods, his cause of death is yet to be determined. Police have also recovered a diary but are not sharing it with the public at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have to continue living with this gruesome tragedy."

I am 32 now.

It's not easy, to be honest. When people talk to you, a lot of them want you to look at their faces, and some of them get annoyed if you don't.

So I have to be creative to survive. I follow several simple rules that help me to make it through the days:

1\. I keep my network limited. No close friends, no in-person shopping, no social events. Thank god I don't have any family members alive!

2\. I keep all conversations short. I say what I need and reply only to get what I need.

3\. When I have to talk to someone, I make myself preoccupied - I stare at my phone or do something else as long as it keeps my eyes below the person's chest. I'm sure everyone thinks I'm an asshole, but I'd rather be an asshole than a deadman.

4\. I have several cell phones. Each has a good, expensive plan, and I always keep all important contacts up to date.

5\. My internet accounts are also well maintained. Internet is my only opportunity to see people's faces. They can't hurt through the screen as long as they aren't looking at you directly. This is why I never turn my camera on at the Zoom meetings.

I got lucky with my career. Nobody really cares about the artist as long as his art is satisfying. Since a young age, my drawing skills have been impressing others. Eventually, it led me to good employment at the local newspaper. I draw satirical cartoons and sketches to highlight important events, both local and international.

All of this helps me to live a decent life despite all the limitations.

You might be wondering why am I doing this. The answer is simple - if I look into somebody's eyes, I might die. I can't be sure, but the chance is extremely high.

People are hostile. They want to see you embarrassed. They want your hiccups when you try to answer their questions. They can get triggered while passing by and assault you - you never know what to expect from them. And sometimes, they might kill you. Don't dare to make eye contact with anyone.

My therapist used to say that this is a strategy that my brain developed to deal with social anxiety syndrome. I don't have a therapist anymore. They don't understand.

There's only one person I can talk to in this world without being afraid of dying - my girlfriend, Sarah. We met several years ago and moved together shortly after.

Her family was very abusive to her, and I helped her to escape. Ever since then, she has been keeping me sane, and there's nothing better than the tea time we have every evening before going to bed. I love her beautiful green eyes.

There's only one thing that's bothering me in Sarah.

I always need to replace her when she starts decomposing."

A feather, panic I couldn't measure

It would seem that I could not

A gobble came instead of a shout…



I could not speak

I felt for my mouth and found a beak

Interestingly, there was a rabbit sitting at the bar, a rabbit of unprecedented size—nearly as big as an average man—and he was wearing a threadbare plaid vest. He was hunched over a highball filled with what appeared to be carrot juice, and he seemed to be in a rather foul mood.

“What gives?” I queried of Paul. “What’s with the impossibly large rabbit?”

He glanced over his shoulder at the rabbit, then said, “You don’t know?”

“No—how could I.”

“Well, my friend, that’s the Easter Bunny—at least he used to be. Apparently he’s been suffering from a worsening case of bunny dementia, and back last spring they had to let him go.”

“You don’t say.”

“I do. He’s been in these last few nights, bothering anybody who’ll listen about how they’d stolen Easter from him and given it to some young punk bunny.”

“*No!*”

“*Yes*. He also said that they’d promised him Thanksgiving as recompense, and that he intended to hold them to their word—said things were gonna be different, that turkeys in particular would soon see a blessed change.”

“Well I’ll be.” I saw the rabbit slip a flask from his pocket and pour something from it into his carrot juice. “I don’t see how he’d go about making any sort of significant change to Thanksgiving, though. I mean, there’s some people in these parts who’re pretty dedicated to tradition.”

“I don’t think anybody’s taking him seriously. He’s just hurt an angry and needing to blow off some steam.”

“That’s understandable. Losing Easter would be a pretty big deal.”

“I’d say so.”

A commotion from the bar attracted our attention. Some young tough who’d had a little too much drink had decided to have some fun at the old rabbit’s expense—and it was plain the old rabbit was growing agitated.

“*Not a good idea*,” Paul sort of singsonged quietly. “*Better be careful*.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because it didn’t work out so well for the last bloke who tried him.”

The young tough laughed heartily, and lightning quick the rabbit struck. In two seconds flat the rabbit had the poor fellow splayed out supine on the bar and was at his throat with his overly large bunny incisors. The youngster had been too surprised by the attack to’ve put up much of a fight; and no sooner than it’d started, it ended. The young tough lay on the bar, blood pouring from the gaping wound in his throat. The rabbit took a look around the room, almost daring anyone to try to stop him, and then he hopped away.

Paul and I took our shot glasses to the bar and held them against the young tough’s neck, filling them to the brim.

“To Easter,” Paul said as he raised his glass, “*and* to Thanksgiving.”

“Aye,” I said, clinking his glass, “and to the great turkey in the sky.”"

Even the vets couldn’t figure out what it was. Cappy wouldn’t even touch his food, let alone his medicine. Instead he lay on my lap or on my side, coughing up blood.

Then he lost his battle with his demons, passing away 3 days later.

I was devastated with grief. I buried him with his favourite bone in my favourite cemetery near my house so I could visit him every day. Even then I shivered in the night, missing the way he would curl up next to me in bed like a hot water bottle.

Then one night I heard someone scratching and barking at the door.

Thinking it was some kind of wild animal, I armed myself with my shotgun and opened the door.

“Cappy!” I cried.

My dog came back! There were bits of leaves and twigs stuck in his fur, and he was a little pale, and his eyes did not look right. But he was happily wagging his tail, and that was all that really mattered.

I prepared a feast for him--his favourite kibble mixed with some bits of cooked chicken. He refused to eat it; instead he pounced on the bowl, scattering food everywhere. Then he tried to chew on the plastic.

In fact, Cappy’s behavior was a little odd over the next few days. I would find dried blood, guts, feathers and sinew all over the floor, the poor animal still squawking in pain. My house was a murder scene every day, and it soon became clear who did it, especially when he brought a poor mynah inside and tore it to pieces.

Then there were nights when he would climb onto my bed and stare at me, his eyes glowing like twin golden suns.

I should’ve shot him there and then, because it was evident this wasn’t my Cappy. But I tried to give him chances; I tried to accommodate him. But my patience was wearing thin day by day.

The final straw was when he bit me.

I wasn’t even playing tug-of-war with him or even feeding him, just getting ready for bed one night when Cappy suddenly *appeared*.

He pounced, his claws raking into my flesh, then his jaws locked into my arm. The skin came off in a smooth rip, and then he swallowed it whole. Then he started to pull on the sinew with his teeth, unravelling it into thin red threads.

“CAPPY! BAD DOG!” I screamed, my voice ringing with pain.

I stumbled towards my shotgun, but my brain was a dense fog. The world was turning gray and starting to spin.

My skin rotted and decayed, flaked off.

The pain suddenly ebbed away. I felt much better. Stronger.

I also felt hungry. And I craved brains. Real, human brains."

Less than 30 of each, and only one vision point that would expire in five minutes. Just enough time for him to get on the bus.

Once he got to work he would ask Joel for a lone. Tomorrow was pay day, so he only needed two points, it wasn't much to ask. He knew he should call first, but with only 20 hearing points, he couldn't afford an outgoing call.

As he was boarding the bus he received an incoming call. Pressing the base of his earlobe he accepted it. It was his boss.

""Alan, I see that you have ran out of VPs.""

""I have, but I'll get Joel to spot me some, don't worry.""

""You know I have no use for a blind man on the line. I'll not have you coming in and causing an accident.""

""I know sir, but it's ok, Joel will spot me, he always does.""

His boss harrumphed and ended the call without saying anything more. He was right though, there was no way he could do his job without any vision points.

""Sounds like you are in a bit of a bind there."" A deep voice said in front of him.

Alan groaned. ""Look, yes, I just ran out of VPs, but I really don't have any other points, so please you don't need to waste your time robbing me.""

""You misunderstand."" The stranger said as he grabbed Alan's right hand in his own. The man rubbed his palm across Alan's and deposit notifications sounded in his ears. His eyes widened as his vision returned and he saw a tall man with dark hair standing in front of him. The man was smiling widely. ""Enjoy the perk of Vision.""

The bus was coming to a stop, and the man moved to exit. ""Wait, I can't pay you back for this!""

Stepping off the bus the man simply said, ""It's ok, you'll just owe me."" The bus was moving again, and he was gone. Alan closed his eyes and mentally called up his balance. 400 points, that was more points than he'd had in his whole life! He briefly considered changing the VPs to other points, but dismissed it. VPs could transfer, but not other points. Transferring was what got him into this bind in the first place.

At work, the clock in computer notified him that he was required in the bosses office. As he stepped inside and closed the door, he heard the heavy thunk of the lock engaging. His boss was looking at the display of all employees VPs, the required perk for this job. His alone was a bar that surpassed everyone else's.

Turning, his boss had his right hand held out, palm up, and a gun in his left. ""You know what to do."" He said advancing on Alan."

Like Houdini, he was out of the handcuffs and ropes. He stood, an imposing 6 inches taller than me even without the stilts I had knocked him down from. I felt myself getting weak, the trauma from childhood still unconquered.

I found myself sitting in a chair. I opened my eyes to see a face covered in the red and white paint in front of me, but my fear felt so dull. It took a few more moments to notice the eyes staring back were my own, and little longer to attempt to remove the paint. My arms grew tired, but the paint remained unbleeding."
r0tbzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r0tbzx/the_stash/,The Stash,25,1,1637718843.0,"West Virginia had some beautiful countryside, especially away from civilization, which Kyle's house certainly was. How many days in a row could you go bow hunting and fishing and riding banana seat bikes down dirt roads? Jeremy was finding out.

When his cousin Kyle, and Kyle's friends Doug and Ray, brought up the topic of a cabin up top yonder hill, and a stash inside, Jeremy's ears perked up. He had taken pains not to complain at all — if he became the asshole city boy in their eyes, it would make the summer even longer — but any change in the muggy day to day routine would be welcome.

""Is this stash, like weed? Moonshine?""

""Nah."" Kyle chuckled. ""Books.""

""All right all right."" On this mountain, 800 miles and 40 years from home, he was about to see an old-fashioned porn stash. Dusty old books with black and white pictures. Hopefully some magazines, too, with the standard of beauty his grandfather would chase back in the day. That would be something different.

On the long hike up, the other boys talked about everything except the cabin. Jeremy didn't even spy it until they were already there. It looked ancient, sitting there among tall trees, abandoned for probably more than a hundred years. The inside beckoned darkly.

""No one's here, right?"" Jeremy, a bit late, thought of tweakers, or growers, or other big problems for a bunch of wandering high school kids.

""Nope. Some other people know about it, but they prefer to stay away. It's really cool, if you walk around, you'll see a circle of stones. This used to be a clearing. Then the trees came back."" He turned on a flashlight and pointed inside. ""Take a look?""

The one-room shack didn't seem like it would have been livable in its prime. No kitchen; a single cot; a table with a pile of books and rows of dusty jars; and another desk with a single book, open to the middle. More like a workspace than a home.

The book wasn't porn at all. It was much older than the cabin. The right-hand page was a drawing, of a small man in a clearing, ringed by stones, waving his hands at… a monster. Many times his size. A random mishmash of eyes, mouths, and parts of squid, elephant, and insect.

The left-hand page was calligraphy: English letters, but not English, or Spanish. Maybe Latin.

""Can you read it? We've tried, but nothing happens.""

The implication was clear: read the text on the left, call up the thing on the right. But you'd have to say it correctly. And maybe a hot-shot city boy could figure out how.

It was a bad idea. If there were any chance it would work. The smart thing would be to go back to hunting, fishing, and bike riding for the rest of July and August.

Jeremy sighed. At least it would be something different.

Slatzsky stood looking out to sea, watching the anchored, unreachable boats being jostled by the bullying waves.

He decided to head back to the greyness of the town; thirty square hovels which contained little besides metal bunks and an iron stove.

His crime for being here was a common one: Slatzsky could not keep his thoughts to himself.

When they came for him they found all his diaries. He was led to a room where, on a scratched and bloodied table was piled all of his books. Inside were his thoughts on the political processes of the First and Only State.

For weeks, his inquisitor came in and tore pages from each diary, screwed them up into balls and forced Slatzsky to eat them. The intestinal pain that followed was horrific and had without doubt caused long-lasting, internal damage.

Back at the town Slatzsky was greeted despondently by the other exiles. Many of them had been out hunting for food but with little success; the rabbits were near extinction. Very few fish hugged the shorelines and the ones that were caught had the taste and texture of a wet mop. Everyone was starving.

""Good thing the Mesothelioma will soon arrive."" A skinny, crippled woman remarked.

Every quarter the rusted hulk would arrive and bring with it fresh food.There was a caveat however.

The Bureau of Torture always came along with their trainees so they could practice their newly acquired skills on the prisoners. It wasn't compulsory but those that volunteered got to eat.

In each of the cold and damp brick houses were mounted several desilvered mirrors, speckled with rot and age. Every prisoner avoided them as best they could but all had glimpsed the damage that had been unleashed on their bodies.

The following morning Slatzsky caught sight of a faint shape bundled inside the coastal fog: the Mesothelioma. Its horn blared and the seagulls called back in return. The vessel would dock within the hour so Slatzsky hobbled back to town.

The news was greeted with subdued joy at the promise of a full stomach. Some wept at the thought of the maltreatment that would occur before they could eat. Slatzsky looked at his fingerless left hand.

Soon enough, the boat docked and the exiled made their way to the jetty to subjugate themselves to the Bureau officials.

Down the gangway came an unfamiliar group of people, accompanied by armed troops. All were dressed in orange suits rather than the usual green. One of them, a squat, bearded man, walked over to greet them.

""Good afternoon,"" he smiled. ""It is so encouraging that so many of you have turned up to volunteer. Shall we eat first before we begin?""

As the surprised prisoners hustled past the man to the food crates, Slatzsky noticed the official's identity badge and felt his own stomach churn.

The man was from the Bureau of Vivisection."

I am one of those who enjoyed to see people that are at a high peak and I don't know why but this also makes me happy. Even though I will never benefit from it and even when it has nothing to do with me, I feel most happy when other people are happy. I can never just be happy on my own and I don't know how to be happy on my own without others being happy. It's like there is a missing piece in my brain and that piece is the only thing that can make one be happy with themselves. 

I really wanted to make this certain kind of family in my area really happy, and I always see them all being grumpy and moaning at each other. It was really bringing me down and so I called down my men who help me make other people happy and we set a date when we were all going to go down to this grumpy families house. We broke into their house very quietly and switched off all alarms and we woke the family up. They were so scared but I reassured them that I was here to make them happy. 

We broke everything inside their house and gave a little beating to the father and we partied all night long. We fed them and then we scared them again as we made them do things like running around the house and other random activities, like playing charades. We also pushed them around and made them sing into the camera and we gave off signs that we were going to kill them. We also told them that we were going to make the family choose first as to who died first and they all those the father. 

I killed one of my men to prove to the family that I meant it and that I was ready to kill. When the time came for the family to die, I made them all look at me and they were all crying. Then I said to all of them at the last minute ""I'm not going to kill anybody"" and the family were so grateful and happy. Their relief and happiness made me happy and I left their house a happy man. 

They still thank me for making them so happy."

To: \[redacted\]

This isn’t you’re the typical story about my experience playing some elaborate game with a set of rules I found on the internet. No; hell no. this is about a lonely boy who fucked up once. Most specifically on thanksgiving.

I had just given up on life, I had just lost my family so I suddenly found myself in a house, alone and free to do whatever I wished to do. My choice was to expend my days gaming and drinking beer. 

My family died on a car accident. Just two weeks before the holiday. Needless to say I was destroyed. Loved them. And dad was the most enthusiastic about it. He dressed up and shit. Me and my sister used to get embarrassed because of it. What I would’ve given to see him again making us laugh and ashamed.

So the day came. I was drunk. I hadn’t been longer than a month since I turned eighteen and with no care for life or the dumbass law I just kept on drinking. There’s when I thought it’d be a good idea to just get spooked instead of sad. So I made up a game. Simple rules. Sit in front of a mirror with the lights off. Open a window or a door that leads to the street and invite them in. who? I didn’t even know I just wanted something to happen. So it did. Last rule was the hardest one to do given the fact you had to start feeling weird about your reflection. To the point you want to look away, but you’re not allowed to. Once you feel like you’re not looking at yourself anymore you got to do something simple. Play a simple children’s game. Rock, paper, scissors. 

I played it. And I fucking lost. 

That night I saw myself everywhere. But it wasn’t me. Or at least didn’t feel like it. I was enjoying dinner at someone’s house. Thanksgiving dinner didn’t have a happy ending for whomever the poor bastards were. I can’t be certain but I felt like they were the dinner somehow.

Then I woke up. It’s been a year and they’re serving dinner for all the inmates. I’ve been scared that whatever it was might be coming out tonight. At least in jail there’s armed guards. I’d be thankful if they just ended this fear I’ve gotten for months. 

What did I let in {redacted\]? you got any idea?

Sincerely yours, Beel.

He could feel the drumbeat of his headache in his back teeth. 

And he was still feeling a little shaky. The car had lurched oddly on the way into the neighborhood. He must have run over a fallen branch or something, and was too slow to compensate in his foggy state. Scary, with his wife and daughter in the car. He was just glad it hadn’t happened on the highway. 

His wife reached over and squeezed his hand, giving him a weary grin. “Shall we?”

“Ready as I’ll ever be,” he said. His feet hitting the ground sent another bolt of pain through his head. 

On the rare occasions he drank too much, he pointedly did not take painkillers the next day. But he should have made an exception for Thanksgiving. His parents were difficult enough under the best of conditions.

And it quickly became clear that this year would not be the best of conditions. The doorbell didn’t ring, and nobody responded to his knock. 

When they entered through the unlocked door, there were no lights on, and the house was very cold. “Mom?” he called out, flipping a light switch to no avail.

The whole house was empty. Ally and Catherine were huddled together on the living room couch, with their coats still on. 

“Nobody’s home.”

Ally opened her eyes. “Did they leave a note? Or send a message?”

He walked to the window. It seemed too dark, even for an overcast late November day. No note, and his phone didn’t get service here. 

“I don’t know where they are,” he said. “I’ll just walk up to the top of the hill and see if I can get a signal there.”

As he was pulling the front door shut behind him, he felt the cement patio twisting underneath him. There was a sudden flood of light and noise and cooking smells. He whirled around, and caught just a glimpse through the closing door. The house lit up and music playing. His mother gesturing with a wooden spoon in the kitchen. His favorite uncle walking over to Ally and Catherine, beaming. He couldn’t see their faces. 

That hurt more than anything else, later on.

The door slammed, and all the sound cut out.

He opened it again, and the house was silent, empty and dark. Just as it had been when they arrived. Except now Ally and Catherine were gone too.

He tried walking back and forth through the front door, until it became ridiculous. He tried many ridiculous things, in the hours and days and weeks that followed. 

In better moments he thought that it wasn’t just bad timing. Some kind of sacrifice was required. Better him than his daughter. And long after he had given up seeing his family again, he thought he might find other lost souls. 

But he was all alone, in an empty and darkening world."

I don’t know why I pulled the trigger. I think if I could go back and do it all again, I would run. Maybe somewhere warm and off the grid, where he couldn’t find me. But I can’t, so instead I’m suffocating in the stale, recycled air behind these metal bars.

His face haunts me still.

When the only sounds are the footsteps of the guards and the jingling keys at their waists, I see him. He’s corpse-white and there are two ink-black holes filled with tar instead of eyes. I try so hard not to look, burying my face beneath the flimsy state-issued cover.

The smell of rot permeates the room and I know he’s still there.

He tells me things; things I don’t wanna know. Like how hard it is to cut through human bone. How long it takes to bleed out and decompose. He talks about vultures pecking away at blue eyes until they are sunny side up, dripping down cheekbones. I don’t wanna hear any of these things.

“I’m glad I killed you!” I shout at him, unsure of my own words. I am certainly relieved he’s dead, but not so much that it was done by my hand. A girl two cells over yells back, and then another chimes in. Now half the block is awake. The guard at the end of the hall tells us to shut up. I grasp the cover tighter.

Images of that night still flow freely through my mind like a film reel; I relive it over and over. I still smell the rain in the air and feel the moist dirt between my fingers. The acid in my stomach rises and burns my throat—just like it did then—as I wait for him behind the old oak tree. His lips part and his eyes almost hit the ground as they absorb the scene.

Bang.

A shiver creeps down my spine. Taking a life isn’t any easier when they deserve it. How many more women would have died by his hand? How many more concussions would I have had to endure? It was necessary.

I don’t want to sleep but the darkness makes it hard. My husband likes to creep in and twist my thoughts around. He paints wild images like walls dripping with crimson warmth. He perverts the truth, placing beast heads on the bodies of his victims, making them dance around in my head. They threaten to devour me, row after row of serrated teeth chase me. I run so fast into the thick fog ahead, but they always catch my scent. Every night, he smiles down at me as these monstrous creatures tear the flesh from my bones. And he laughs. But every morning, as the sleep haze dissipates, I smile. And I laugh.

I know why I pulled the trigger. And I think now, if I could go back and do it all over again, I wouldn’t change a thing.

Fluffy clouds, harps, 75-inch flat screen TV’s *and* decent internet connection at least 90% of the time.

That last one can’t be overstated. 

I’ve been playing Halo: Infinite for a while now with some guys from the 12th, 17th and 3rd Century and let me tell you- they’re not half bad!

Fun Heaven Facts? Shakespeare is Furry, Elvis is *really* into Warhammer and Bob Marley has taken up knitting.

It’s a pretty damn awesome place. Highly, *highly* recommend it if you can get here.

See, I was quite fortunate.

I was young when I died. Single digit young.

If we’re being blunt and clinical, I was murdered.

It was painful as well. 

There was… nothing gentle about it. 

The physical aspect of being choked to death with a leather belt was awful, sure, but the emotional aspect of being held down by my grandpa as he ended my life made it even worse.

They never found my body.

But I was now in paradise, and I had been for the last thirty Earth years. 

I’d had some therapy, joined a support group for murder victims, and picked up a few new hobbies.

After a while you hit a point where your time of consciousness in the afterlife is longer than your time on Earth, and that’s quite a sobering moment. 

You eventually have more memories *here* than you do from *there*, and the PTSD is less likely to hit you like a tonne of bricks.

You feel… okay.

*I* felt okay.

I was happy.

I was in paradise for a *long* time and it was… nice.

Until one day when I received a message.

See, when family die, you are informed. If they end up in Heaven you are given the chance to visit them, it’s a great way of reconnecting.

But I was shocked.

Apparently, a deathbed confession and a last-minute baptism is literally all you need to get into heaven and sure enough, standing at the pearly gates, my grandpa was there with an amazed and bewildered smile on his face.

And like that, all my progress was stripped away. I can feel the leather around my neck, the terror as I remember choking out for help, the powerlessness as my eyes lost focus.

I begin to have a panic attack, and then I feel a warm hand on my shoulder.

“Fear not, child.” The angel says, it’s voice instantly calming me; “You are in *Heaven*, remember? No harm shall befall you.”

“But…” I protest, but it silences me.

“*You* are in Heaven, and in Heaven you are granted what you desire, and we have waited a long time to give you what you have truly wanted…”

And the angel points, and my grandpa is suddenly restrained. 

His smile is gone. 

The space I am in now is different. 

It’s… hotter. 

Darker.

“You deserve to give him Hell.”

And the angel hands me a belt."

Its what brought us together. I went to a bar and she was there, her wonderous voice filling the dingy room. After that I was in love, her gorgeous looks entwined with her voice made me weak at the knee's. I was obsessed. It took a while but I managed to work up the courage to ask her on a date, and even more courage not too fait when she agreed. 

From then on we moved fast, after 4 months she moved in, after 5 months we rescued a kitten together and after six months the cracks began to show. Like - when she would do the dishes - she never properly scrubbed any pans or when she would go out she would leave her makeup everywhere. I would have been okay with this - every couple fights - but then it started to affect her voice.

After an argument - her voice would sound gravely - in contract to the smooth buttery noise it once emitted. After I corrected her mistakes, the noise would be nasally and disgusting to listen to. It got so bad that I couldn't bring myself listen to her.

So imagine my surprise, when I was sat in the kitchen washing knifes - for me to hear the most angelic voice coming from the bedroom. It was clearly Sarah's voice, but not the new Sarah, the one I had fallen in love with all those months ago.

 After all, I didn't know people could sing without a tongue.

I didn't know it could reach such a high pitched noise either,. I didn't know it would make my eardrums bleed - my eyes bleed - my nose bleed. I didn't know that once a noise becomes so shrill  it becomes deadly. 

I  didn't know, I would prefer that to the nasty gurgling that followed, when I tried to make it stop.

It was unfortunate when subject 47's bloated corpse was found in the local reservoir and when we discovered signs that he had severe neurological damage due to a previously unknown prion infection we did consider the possibility of the infection being passed to others but ruled this out as unlikely.

The events of the past few weeks and the increase in women in the local community attacking and killing those around them is I assure you entirely coincidental.

As the greenhorns it was our duty to repair the ocean of barbed wire in the no man’s land tonight.

It was a quiet, eerie night, only lit by a looming moon and the erratic flames of some bonfires in the far distance.

“What’s the deal with these fires? Why are the French giving away their positions?” I asked a more seasoned soldier.

“They burn the dead, because of the gh…” he paused for a second, while his empty eyes wandered into the void of the sky: “…because of the wolves!” he continued with his tormented voice.

We went slowly and silently out of the trench into the darkness and uncertainty of the night. The vicinity was merely lit by the pale and giant moon. Which greedily stared like the eye of a cyclopean god through the firmament into this world. Its faint light was barely able to repel the shadows of the night, so that they won’t consume us immediately, when we take our first steps forward.

We entered a dead world, whose only inhabitants used to be the endless thickets of barbed wire. The cold metal was as twisted and distorted as the mangled bodies and wretched souls of the lost soldiers, who found nothing but death in here. A landscape littered with craters out of earth and doom, which are filled with puddles from the tears of the deceased and those of the sky.

Millions of years and a myriad of asteroids, fragments of fallen planets, were needed to create a similar looking wasteland on the surface of the moon. But here just four years were necessary, combined with the whole inventiveness and the infinite madness of the human race to destroy itself.

We entered a dead world, as it entered our hearts, only to be truly unseen by the ones who won’t see the end of the war.

1. Never go anywhere without your gun or helmet. This is essential, gun discipline must be maintained at all times. 
2. The only exception for rule 1 is during showers or sleep, in which you MUST only do so within designated areas. Failure to do so will result in execution. 
3. When cleaning or maintaining your gun, ensure that at least four people are with you at all times. You must be deployed in standard formation, one to watch the skies, one to watch the ground, and the other two must be thirty feet away, their guns trained on you. 
4. If at any point formation is breached, you are expected to at bare minimum fire a flare, but if possible pull a grenade and take them out with you. 
5. Dig graves only on grassy land. Their presence kills greenery so you'll spare your comrades the indignity of desecration after death. 
6. If at any moment you see a comrade which you are sure is dead walking around, shoot them and bring their corpse to your nearest Reporting Station. You will be rewarded with two (2) ration packs. 
7. The enemy will screech and scream at night. This is a psychological trick. Do not investigate or lose heart, use your allocated ear plugs. 
8. Reject all attempts of surrender. 
9. Should you be injured in any way, pour iodine on the wound, before pouring salt water. It will sting, and we recommend you use painkillers or our rationed alcohol first, but if your wound glows green amputate immediately. 
10. If it is not on a limb we are sorry, do not resist or your family will not get compensation. 
11. There have been rumors of widespread enemy infiltration. These are baseless, do not believe them no matter what. Stay strong and united with your brothers in arms. 

That is all. Thank you for your service, may the nation survive a few more weeks with your sacrifice."

The trend caught more traction. Within the year, $500,000 funded by donations from those who wanted to A) see evidence of the supernatural, or B) continue to watch fools' delusions.

*If you could prove your parapsychological claims, you win the prize money of $1,000,000.*

Five years. One million dollars. Millions of people watching what started as a goof. Public appearances. Podcasts. A full-blown legal and human resources team, all to prove that nothing under the sun has gone unseen. And a television show exposing the crazy.

His name was Jeff Smith. Unlike others we've had on the show, Jeff was nondescript. Working a menial job. Living in the same studio apartment for most of his adult life. And his claim?

""I'm psychic.""

We avoided psychics on the show. Their claims are all mental in a ""show-don't-tell"" world, and exploitation of their idiocy is a bore. If our producers and screeners rolled him up though, we were game.

""I don't do guessing lottery numbers. But I got two predictions. Specifically for y'all.""

We leaned in.

""The first, you won't give me prize money.""

A logic game more than a prediction. The paradoxical nature means if we don't give him prize money, we actually should give it to him, and vice versa. Clever, we say. Though hardly psychic proof.

He ignored. ""The second prediction is a bit more,"" Jeff took a beat, ""severe."" Then a question. ""What would it take for one of you to kill the other?""

My partner immediately called security. I thanked Jeff for his time and waited for him to be escorted out of the building. We've been threatened before so this isn't new.

""My prediction is I know what it takes for one of you to kill the other. Just like I knew exactly what to say to your producers and screeners to get here. Just like I know security is on the way, but on opening those doors, they'll see one of you dead, and me? Gone.""

When security found us, Jeff was gone, and my partner strangled by my hands. I had to. There was no other choice. Jeff was right, and walked away without the prize money as it sat locked during my ongoing imprisonment.

The part I haven't told was Jeff's third prediction:

These idiots, morons, people we've exploited -- they outnumber us by the millions. And they will do anything, and everything, to prove us wrong."

Everybody was so kind to her, and gave her all sorts of treats, and they always had an extra-nice meal at home. And nothing hurt that much- the hospital was such a fun place anyway- more toys than she ever had at home, and there was a huge model trains set with different stations and little people and buttons you could press to make the lights go on and off and the rails turn and click.

But best of all was the giant fish tank. The big glass window covered an entire wall almost- and there were many colorful beautiful fish, big and small, swimming about, in and out of a beautiful mermaid palace with silver and green lights, and a ship, and all sorts of wavy plants and fantastic rocks. Melinda could look at them forever, which was just as well, because sometimes the hospital visits took hours and hours. 

But Melinda could never get bored watching the fish. She was there so much these days that she recognized most of them and gave them names- the bright pink and yellow one she called Flower, and then Sucker One and Sucker Two, who stuck to the glass pane and cleaned it, and Leopard, Funky and silly Daisy with her round open mouth, and the big ones: Moon and Ocean. But Flower was her favourite, with her stunning colours and she swam about even more gracefully than the others.

As Melinda spent more and more time there, she began making up stories about the fish, how Flower and Funky were best friends and swam about in the mermaids’ palace and the ship together and wouldn’t play with silly Daisy, and how Moon and Ocean squabbled over the food and wouldn’t share it properly with the rest, but wise old Leopard would talk to them and make sure everyone got their fair share.

Sometimes, when it hurt a lot, Moon and Ocean would behave even more badly. They bullied Funky and Flower until they escaped to the palace and hide. One time it hurt so much and that was when Daisy got her silly open mouth stuck on one of the smaller spiky plants and was squiggling frantically head down, trying to break free, the eye facing Melinda wide open and terrified. Daisy wasn’t there at the next hospital visit.

It must have been a few visits after that when everything was awful and Melinda screamed with pain, later on she was in the waiting room and she watched Moon and Ocean chase Flower, tearing pieces off her delicate beautiful floaty fins and then her body, Flower was swimming crooked, Funky and Leopard were hiding in the mermaid’s palace.

Melinda watched in horror as Moon and Ocean ripped Flower apart as she was still moving, bright pink and yellow pieces of her falling slowly on the tank floor.

Melinda’s knees buckled and she fell too and she never watched fish after that."

Most of the house lights were out, and all the kids were long gone. 

Elliott stuffed another snickers in his mouth.

Every town has a house that kids are scared to go near and in this town, it was Oakwood. 

Elliott looked up from his bag of chocolatey swag to find himself standing at the end of the path to Oakwood. 
It’s crooked wooden fence leaning in the wind. Golden leaves rustled across the weed-infested path that led up to a dilapidated porch. 

A chill ran down Elliott’s spine as he watched the old grey door creak open, revealing a pitch-black hallway beyond. 

“Come in”, whispered a soft soothing voice from inside the darkness. 

Elliott hesitated by the gate, peering through the door trying to get a glimpse of what was in the hallway. 

“I have candy inside, come in”, the voice added 

Elliott slowly crept down the path, his desire for chocolate overruling his common sense. 

The door opened wider to reveal a slim young woman with long fiery auburn hair that hung down over her shoulders. She was wearing a long flowing purple dress. 

Her hypnotic voice drew Elliott closer. 
“I’ve got lots of candy” she smiled as Elliott reached the old creaking porch. 

The woman held out her hand, showing Elliott a selection of chocolate bars and sweets. 

As Elliott stepped over the threshold, he looked down the hallway lit by a series of candles along the wall. At the end of the hallway he could see the kitchen which had a large boiling pot bubbling on the stove. 

The door shut behind him. He turned, the slender young woman had been transformed into an elderly woman with a crooked back and spots over her veiny skin. Her hair was not white and greasy. She smiled at him with a mouth of yellow and black teeth. 

The women grabbed Elliott’s wrist and dragged him towards the kitchen.

Elliott desperately grasped for something to hold onto as he was pulled down the hall. 

The women yanked on Elliott’s arm as he clung onto the walls. 

She stretched her boney arm out towards the kitchen. Flames surged up around the base of the pot. 

She picked Elliott up and tucked him under her arm. 

She let out an evil cackling laugh as she walked into the kitchen. 

The door slammed shut. 

After a few moments, all that could be heard in the house was Elliott’s screams."

I need my hands steady. I’ve played concerts before, even solo ones, but never like this, never Carnegie Hall. This is a dream come true, a culmination, *a knock on the door*—

“Yes?” I say, surprised they’ve let someone in to see me.

My specific instructions—

Then:

I see his face.

I—

*’m thirteen years old, seated in front of a piano. I keep playing the same passage. Beethoven. Always messing it up. My wrists aren’t loose enough. My mind is elsewhere. As I depress the keys, I am imagining myself: successful: famous. My parents and music teachers tell me I am phenomenal, a prodigy. But I know better. I’m good, but I’m not great. I’ll never be great.*

He walks in holding a bundle of papers.

“Tonight is for me,” he says.

He drops the papers on my lap. “You’ll play this. To the very end.”

*My regular teacher is sick. I have a substitute. I hate substitutes. This one is a young man, thin and handsome. After listening to me play, he says, “You lack talent—but I can grant it to you.” I ask him what he wants in return. “Someday, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to play a concert for me.”*

I stare at the papers:

“Reckoning”

*My playing is extraordinary. I am as if possessed.*

I walk out to thunderous applause.

Carnegie Hall is full.

I take my seat behind the black Steinway, place the papers in front of me and begin to play. Immediately, I sense confusion. This is not Ravel’s *Gaspard de la nuit* but something utterly different, atonal and demonic; fiendishly difficult, inexplicable. Inhumanly brilliant!

*Gasps.*

A few audience members have risen, heading for the exits—

Which are disappearing:

Further erased with each depression of the piano keys, until Carnegie Hall has no exits, and I see them in their formalwear touching hopelessly where the doors used to be. Confused, panicking.

I could not stop playing now even if I wanted to.

*I don’t want to.*

More is erased. Feature by feature, the walls—the entire interior—is being lost, replaced by nothingness. People are screaming. Nearly three thousand voices accompanying my pandemonium, a choir of the Damned. I no longer even flip the papers to see the notes. I know the notes, for they have always burned within.

Carnegie Hall is a smooth void.

Some rage. Others have collapsed, saliva seeping from their mouths.

He stands now, in the back, holding a drill, laughing; he raises the drill to his forehead and trepans himself.

*I’ve a*—

*head*ache. I play—

They begin to vaporise, to wisp, and, wisped, become sucked into the hole in his head, one after the other, like bloody water down a drain.

Until:

They’re gone. / He’s gone.

And I am alone.

The piano: too disappears. Time itself:

disappears.

And I am I, forever alone,

in nothingness."

There it was. The spooky creature, made up of clothes, sheets and a child’s imagination. It sat in the corner on my rocking chair. I was six, fresh into my new big boy bed. Mum took the safety rails off the sides and everything. No nightlight, nothing. I was a big kid now, and I feared nothing. I was brave and a grown-up now, with nothing in the world that could stop me. I saw no boundaries, but everything would come crashing down during bedtime, all thanks to the imagination of a naïve child.

It stared at me with nonexistent eyes, its nonexistent claws holding it into place on the chair. I truly wonder why linen looks so scary at night time? Pale creatures and humanoids alike could go toe to toe with my mother’s linen. I feared them deeply, and am forever thankful that I no longer have to live in that maze of sheets and laundry. My apartment is a whole lot different, with windows and multiple rooms! Unfathomable to the child's mind, it was possible to live without mommy or daddy. I was doing fine on my own but was truly struggling to enjoy it.

With new beginnings, comes a period of loneliness and with loneliness comes desperation. You savor every moment, not having anyone to share it with. Every memory, deep-fried into your brain, simply because you have nothing to distract you from it. I was waiting and hoping for a roommate reply on every site I posted on but got nothing. My parents would occasionally stop by, reminding me of how sad my life truly was. The only damn company I get are my parents? Pathetic. It is unenjoyable, even with the knowledge that I still have the ability to feel.

Of all the things I have whined and complained about, nothing will come even remotely close to the feeling I get when thinking about this next question. I have covered pride, loneliness, memory, sadness, but have yet to truly get into any stronger emotions, such as fear. Here goes nothing. If it was nothing but linen, then why does it still sit at the edge of my bed?"
r0e6c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r0e6c6/spreddit/,Spreddit,213,8,1637676934.0,"So, I write bios and do some talent management for Spreddit, a small porn fish in a sea of PornHub and YouJizz whales. Our active users have always been dedicated and our paying subs tend to stick around, but we have a sort of campy horror S&M niche. Or rather, we used to. 

Now, our niche is one woman. 

**Ayame Ita.**

I was one of the people that interviewed Ayame, and before your imagination wanders too far afield, it didn’t involve a casting couch, a coy psych student and a POV video. It involved a 1099 form and a three position suck and fuck in our studio in San Fernando. 

I rewatched the footage.  She opened to camera, and her vocals were appropriately vigorous. A lot of people on SSS (*Starlets, Sluts and Studs*—our talent branch) thought she’d be a natural. But there was something off about her. 

For one, she never seemed to physically emote. Don’t get me wrong, she had a pretty face, but it never—and I mean *never*—moved. Even when she had a cock in her mouth, it was almost like a circular part of her face just disappeared to accommodate it. 

It was strange. 

Despite this, she became a fixture on the site in relatively short order. The line of other talent looking to get a scene with her grew, some practically clamoring for the chance. The thing was, the scenes *were* hot, but I just couldn’t ignore that lifeless face staring into the camera as her body writhed and flexed. 

Reed Daly, one of our “studs,” noticed too. “Her face…it’s not a mask, but it might as well be. As soon as they start rolling though, it’s like I forget who I’m with until we’re done.”

My girlfriend had a harder time grasping my discomfort. “What’s the problem? She *does* have a pretty face and… the girl can fuck.”

“Yeah,” I replied, “but she’s like a sex doll from the neck up.”

“You think you can do better? Let’s see it.”  She pointed her cellphone camera at me. 

I smirked. “You’re on.”

I had made sex tapes before. It comes with the territory of dating civilians while working in the industry. But I never watch them after. 

The next night, however, I got an email from Spreddit.

**Subject:** MisterMissedHer commented: “great video!!”

More came after, and finally, I followed an embedded link to the video. It was my sex tape. Me and my girlfriend. 

No. 

Me and…Ayame. 

I watched her face glitch open around my cock. I watched her grind. I watched me thrust. And…I watched my face as I came. *Nothing*. It was a vacant mask. Handsome in frame, but dead in the eyes. The mirror now shows me the same plastic visage and lately, I’ve begun to forget my girlfriend’s face—my sister’s face and my friends’. In every memory, they’re *all* Ayame. 

My video did well by the way. You can look it up:

But as the beatings continued, I found that it wasn't me. It was him. And I was trapped. 


As time went on, he apologised and said that a baby would heal our rift. I didn't believe him. 


To my horror, days later I learned an awful truth. I was pregnant. 


I tried to hide the swelling for as long as possible, but eventually I couldn't hide it from Josh anymore. He, as the fucking dick would be, was delighted. I, on the other hand, was devastated. I didn't want to bring a child like Josh into the world. 


It didn't matter though, while Josh was away on ""business,"" I lost the baby. I took a morbid sense of joy watching his face fall. But then it was me falling, from a punch to the head. 


Fate is a bitch. 


Every year, I fell pregnant. Always around Thanksgiving. My stomach was as swollen as the turkey on the dinner table. Like I had something to be thankful for?


I knew Josh was having an affair. He was repulsed by my stomach. By our child. I lost the next one when he snuggled up to that bitch. I lost the third when he went on another ""business"" trip to Vegas. More like taking her on a dirty weekend. 


When he came back, and my stomach was saggy and flat, I took another beating. I didn't go out for weeks not wanting anyone to see what he had done. I was never able to escape Josh or his anger. But I made sure I never gave birth to his child either. 


However, I did manage to slip away one year. 


When he came home he cried his eyes out. Begged the heavens that he would be a better man. But fuck him! 


I felt relief for the first time. Free from his beatings. Free from his pain. Josh was devastated that I had gone. That his hold on me was broken. 


He didn't know I was still close. 


Eventually he moved on. Made that bitch his new wife. Little did she know, she just replaced me as his new punching bag.


Last night, they sat down to a Thanksgiving feast. Josh tucked into a fat turkey, grease dribbling down his chin. His eyes went wide in shock when my child gargled. He rose from his chair when the other two scrambled up, throwing the turkey high. 


He couldn't see them. Neither of them could. But that didn't mean we weren't there, waiting for the perfect opportunity. 


The lady screamed past a black eye, but my children were told not to harm her. After all, it wasn't *really* her fault. She didn't know. But Josh? Fuck him!


There's a certain joy in being a ghost. He won't ever harm anyone again, and this time, it's him that's  trapped. By me."

This is your employee guide. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Why is the pay for this place so high? Well, we take care of our employees; and you’ll be earning every cent of those 30 dollars an hour. Don’t worry, you’ll get all the money we promised you and more, as long as you follow the rules.

Now, this place is… not clean, if you catch my drift. But it’s ok, it’s easily containable. The thing won’t escape as long as there’s somebody here, and we sacrifice someone to it every once in a while! Sometimes it’s an employee that doesn’t follow the rules, but don’t worry about it; there’s a lot of homeless people out there.

Now, rules!

1.  Don’t eat inside these premises. Water is fine, heck it even accepts milk or tea, but anything other than these three drinks is a no go. 

2. Keep walking. Ideally never stay still for more than 10 minutes at a time. If you have to use the bathroom urgently, turn on the fans and automatic doors, that should buy you at least 15 minutes. 

3. Don’t sleep. Don’t.

4. Rooms 1, 3, 8, 11 and 17 are off limits. If you accidentally walk into them, apologise, and back away without turning around. As long as you don’t spend more than 30 seconds in one you’ll be fine.

5. Listening to music is recommended. Sometimes you might hear sounds that might frighten or disorientate you, so if you like blast that heavy rock music. Just wear earphones.  

6. Don’t read anything out loud. Talking or whistling is fine, but for some reason it hates people reading things. So nev-

You know the one I’m talking about, tube TV hanging in the corner of the room, ripped chairs with exposed yellow brown foam.

The people around me were society’s poorest, the leftovers, the unwanted. But I was lower. It was these people who looked down on me with disgust. It was these people, who have never turned their nose up at anyone in their entire lives, who were now turning their nose up at me.

But I couldn’t blame them. I sat in a chair in the corner, both feet off the ground, knees clutched to my chest. My hair was a tangled mess and while I wasn’t sure if my eyes were bulging out of my head, they sure felt like they were. My whole body was aching, and bugs were crawling under my skin.

In case you haven’t guessed it by now, I’m a dirty low life junkie. And I was having withdrawals.

The nurse came out of one of those swinging hospital doors and looked down at her clipboard. She called my name. She looked up just as I was getting up from my chair. Her face said it all. Pure disgust.

I followed her down the hall and walked into one of the rooms. I sat down in the chair as the nurse already started rolling up my sleeves.

“How long has it been?” she asked me.

But I didn’t answer her. I could smell her blood. She smelt clean, new, and *delicious.*

Before I could even control myself I lunged at her, my fangs exposed, ready to bite into her juicy skin.

The nurse, quick as lightning, gave me a backhanded slap right to the jaw. Pain reverberated around my skull as I blacked out. I slumped back into the chair barely conscious.

“Goddam, junkie scum,” she said as she walked out of the room.

The next thing I knew a different woman walked into the room, this was the doctor I suppose. She looked at me, again just pure disgust in her face. She walked towards me and slapped me right in the face. This time I yelled in pain.

“You just shut the fuck up right now,” the doctor hissed as she unceremoniously put a needle in my arm. The possum blood that entered my system instantly made me feel better but just barely.

She threw the needle in the bin and then removed her latex gloves. Before she left she turned to me.

“You know, it’s vampire scum like you that are ruining this city,” she said basically spitting out the words, “Walking around at night, attacking innocent people. It’s because of you that we all have to wear this.”

She pulled down the collar of her lab coat to expose the thick metal collar around her neck.

He regularly started fires indoors and shot at the farm animals. He once took Ethel’s wedding ring and threw it down the sink. Smashed the headlights to John’s truck. He was fond of guns and knives and always writing stories about torture. He was arrested multiple times. Joseph rarely interacted with Lisa. Little did Lisa know Joseph was infatuated with her. John fought all day with Joseph telling him to get a job and not to mooch off his parents. Joseph refused to get a job and stole money from his parents to spend on drugs. This would be the gravest mistake of the Harris familiy’s lives. John and Ethel went to bed thinking Joseph had stormed out of the house. They didn’t know he lay underneath their bed machete in hand. After chopping his father’s throat blood sprayed across the room. Ethel awoke but before she could scream Joseph stabbed her. She rolled out of the bed and looked at her son with tears in her eyes. Joseph repeatedly stabbed her. Afterwards he went into his sister’s room. She awoke but he ductaped her mouth shut. After indulging in his desires he removed her head and went to to the kitchen. He cooked her thoroughly and cannibalized her. She tasted like fields of gold. Joseph was no fool. He faked his death and assumed a new life, marrying and having children of his own. Nobody ever knew of his dark secret."

&#x200B;

The park is just a quick 2-minute walk away and I let Rocky pull me the whole way there. He was just excited.

&#x200B;

When we got to the park, I let him off the lead so he can run around and explore. We always walk the same way and he always pees in the same places. But today...today was different.

&#x200B;

""What's up?"" I asked him, as he's sniffing out a trail. ""What can you smell, bud?""

&#x200B;

He sniffed up and down, round and round, up and down again, and eventually, we ended up at a small hole in the hedges that surrounded the park.

&#x200B;

""Rocky don't-"" Too late. He'd already gone through the hole.

&#x200B;

On the other side of the hedge was a small grassy clearing which was surrounded by tall trees and let in absolutely no sunlight. Rocky was stood there, perfectly still...Staring.

&#x200B;

""Rocky, what are you-"" My mouth fell open at the sight.

&#x200B;

Stood infront of us, in a shining aura of sparkling diamonds, was something that can only really be labelled as, an alien.

&#x200B;

It was beautiful. He was beautiful. The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. It grew brighter the more I looked. Brighter, and brighter, and *brighter...*

&#x200B;

I remember hearing Rocky bark and yelp. I remember hearing a scream...maybe lots of screaming?...I remember a sudden flash of light, and a jolt to the body.

&#x200B;

I was back home.

&#x200B;

I was in the kitchen.

&#x200B;

I looked around in quick confusion, then realised I was holding something...It was a knife. A blood-soaked knife.

&#x200B;

I dropped the knife and suddenly noticed just how much blood I had all over me, how much there was all over the floor. I had no other choice but to follow the trail, which led in to the dining room.

&#x200B;

My mouth fell open once more.

&#x200B;

On the ground, lay my poor Rocky...What was left of him. He'd been brutally murdered, and worst of all, by me.

&#x200B;

The sparkling diamonds caught my eye once more, and I turned to face him.

&#x200B;

""Thank you for your time."" He said.

&#x200B;

I just stood there for a while. Not moving, not saying anything. I eventually shook my head, trying to gain some sort of clarity...and that's when I saw the second body.

&#x200B;

""Steeve!!"" I screamed.

&#x200B;

Laying on the floor, with his torso mainly open, and *almost* cut in two, was my husband.

&#x200B;

His hands and feet were missing and his ligaments were drowning in a pool of blood that had not long ago escaped. His eyes had been gauged out, leaving nothing but dark and rotting holes, and his nose had been sliced through the middle, but still attached to his face.

&#x200B;

The beautiful being had followed me around my house, standing closely behind me, watching me in my horrified state.

&#x200B;

""Whyyy?!"" I asked.

&#x200B;

""Sorry."" He replied. ""I just wanted to know how it felt."""

The satisfying physical work of mashing the potatoes to that almost-smooth consistency. The gorgeously vibrant crimson of the red velvet cake and the heavy crumb of the pumpkin pie crust. The aroma of garlic on everything I could add it to.

Thanksgiving was the cooking event of the year, just slightly more special than even Christmas, as the first chance in so long to enjoy an extravagant and traditional meal.

This year Josh was bringing his new wife, Sophie. I’d adored her from our first FaceTime, and even though it was a tad early, I had encouraged him recently when he said he was going to propose. I’d wished I could do more than Zoom into my only son’s pandemic wedding, but respected their simple, joyous fall ceremony.

I spent all day perfectly setting up the dining and living room areas, in between mixing and flipping and chopping. I hoped my home would be perfect and welcoming for the first time I met Sophie in real life.

&#x200B;

She was even more gorgeous in person, glowingly beautiful. She generously complimented my macaroni, sided with me in cheeky jest during my and Josh’s good-humored Monopoly fight, and showed interest in our extended family members with a sweet charm. Josh had met her in Berkeley where his work had brought him, so I had still worried that once I met her in person she’d be one of those “snowflakes” but so far she was passing the test and seemed perfectly normal.

Halfway through Apples to Apples, Josh said to the room full of relatives, “So, everyone… we’re really excited to share some news.” He looked to Sophie.

She beamed. “We’re having a baby! I’m due in April.”

I gasped in joy. A *grandchild*. My thoughts filled with images of spoiling the little one with cookies and toys and hugs and kisses. “Oh my goodness, get over here!” I exclaimed to her, opening my arms to embrace her as everyone gushed.

Something seemed odd about her, disoriented, as I approached her across the room. She set the pumpkin pie aside and stood to hug me, but a few seconds into the hug, she started to gasp and wheeze, then collapsed into my arms.

&#x200B;

The paramedics rushed her to the hospital.

But it was too late.

In the emergency room, I held Josh as he cried in my arms. “I don’t understand it,” I said. “Nobody had allergies back in my day.”

Josh slowly withdrew from my embrace and squinted at me through his tears. “Did you hide the pecans in something on purpose? After I *specifically* told you she was allergic?”

“Everyone is so sensitive nowadays. I just wanted to prove she was faking it!”"
qzxare,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qzxare/the_watchers/,The Watchers,46,4,1637618922.0,"My life is far from your typical everyday existence, my life consists of dangers beyond your wildest imagination, or should I say, nightmares. You see the world is a strange place, full of strange realities. I am a hunter of sorts. I hunt what are known as the watchers. If you knew the true extent of the horrors, and the evil malicious nature of these beings, then you would probably go insane with fear!


I was a child when I first learned of their existence. It started as faint whispers, barely audible, but they were there nonetheless. Calling out my name, beckoning me from the darkest corners of my room. I couldn't see them, only the inhuman tones of their voices were revealed to me. The watchers thrive on instilling fear, they know your deepest and darkest thoughts, they bring out the demons within your very mind, and then feast upon your despair.


That shadow you see in your peripheral vision, that is a watcher, studying you, always just within sight, but never to be seen. They are always watching, and they are always hungry, hungry for your sanity!


The first time I laid eyes upon one, my mind became overwhelmed by incomprehension, their true form is shapeless, unexplainable. To see one in its true form is rare. They much prefer to hide in plain sight. 


Was that your mum who made your breakfast this morning, can you actually be sure? Or was it perhaps a watcher in the shape of your mother? If so, then I'm sorry to say that she is already dead. Replaced by a watcher.


You may think of these writings as the ramblings of a madman, someone who has lost all of their faculties. That is a reasonable assumption. But I have seen them! I am writing this in the hopes of educating you, opening your mind to the real dangers. The real threat to humankind!


I fear that they are too numerous to even stop! I have killed two of them, though it pained me to do so. The watcher emulated my mother's screams, and my father's cries for mercy very convincingly. As the machete in my hand dripped with the blood of my enemy, tears fell from my eyes. But a sense of accomplishment filled my heart. I had avenged my parents deaths, I had slain the creatures that took the shape of their bodies so convincingly.


I wish I could kill more, and paint myself with their blood. But current circumstances prevent that unfortunately…


It's hard to hunt when you are confined to a padded cell 24/7."

I don't need to Google it because I can Steven it. Steven is a guy I know and he has so much knowledge in his head that it is just unbelievable to me how 1 brain could process that much information. Any question I might have on any subject whether it be mathematics, English, history, geography or when somebody is going to die or get resurrected, Steven knows it. So I don't need to Google it but rather I could just Steven it. 

Also unlike Google Steven knows more deeper and delicate information like what some random person does in his or her spare time. When I wanted to know about the in and outs of the secret Life of Lucas, Google didn't know it but Steven knew everything about Lucas. Steven knew what Lucas enjoyed doing like staring at his own feet because the fungus growing on it is talking to him. Steven also knew when Lucas shopped for groceries, or how he went to the toilet and how he took his showers. It was so fascinating to hear about the private life of Lucas. Steven also knew that whenever Lucas found a mirror he would charge at violently like an animal, it's so fascinating. 

Then when I wanted to know information about a random woman just for laughs, I was astonished how Steven knew everything about this women even though she didn't know him. He knew when she went to work, what car she drove, her favourite meals and the places she enjoyed going. He also knew the interior design of her house and took pictures of the house and of the women sleeping, without her ever knowing. It was just incredible that Steven was just better than Google. 

Then when I wanted to know everything about a certain random family, Steven told me things that Google wouldn't have told me. Steven told me how he stayed inside a certain strange families house without that family ever knowing, and he told me how the father had to constantly stop the mother from sacrificing thier children in the name of witchcraft. He also told me how the father liked to choke himself by using teddy bears and how the children pretend to be dead majority of the time to trick the mother into not killing them already. 

Then when the whole family ended up dead, Steven didn't know anything about it and that was unusual because he knows everything. He just doesn't want to talk about it for some odd reason and some people call him a stalker and a murderer, but to me he is a better version of Google."

It's teeth flash for a second

That maybe it's polite

You stop going for your trigger

Show it compassion, it might not bite

I was walking the halls, I’m a guard, when suddenly, I heard what sounded like crying, ‘weird’ I thought, but it was only nine and worked ended at eight, maybe someone stayed behind. I followed the crying and was soon at the photo-copying room, so I walked in and looked about. No one, simply no one, and on top of that, the crying had stopped when I walked in, so I left, confused. 

I wish I hadn’t left that room, since then he appeared, I saw it walking down the hall, it was tall, I’d reckon 6,5, skinny, and of course, a long blue cloak. I couldn’t make out any of the faces details as it was looking down with a hood over it’s had. now, I’d like to say that I did something, and I almost did, but then I heard its footsteps, loud bang after loud bang, but not like it was down the hall, loud like it was inside my ear, it was so strange-sounding, I took off running, and that brings us here, with me locked in.

The terrible sound of a woman screaming jolted Beth out of sleep. It was the early hours of the morning, still fully dark. For one horrible instance she thought the screams were coming from inside, they sounded so clear and loud, and then she realised they were from outside, but not far from her bedroom window.

 It wasn’t the first time in the recent months that Beth’s sleep had been shattered by outside activities. As she and Jeremy had use to joked somewhat resentfully, “pandemic had brought the crazies out”, and their once-calm neighbourhood had witnessed an increasing number of homeless-looking people wandering around. Fights and shouting were no longer uncommon, and on a couple of occasions Beth had enjoyed a front-row view in her ground floor apartment of shaggy men punching each other viciously outside her window. She had in fact called the police on them, and Jeremy had yelled at her for being an interfering “Karen”.

  But this terrified female screaming was something new. Beth did not feel safe and cowered under her duvet, hoping to god someone else would call the police. Jeremy was not there, she was alone. There was no wailing of the sirens, and the screaming died down soon. Beth hoped she could fall back asleep, although in honesty, what with Jeremy leaving and their painful recent break-up her, sleep was fragmented at best.

  She was just drifting off when she heard it. Tap…tap… at her window. Instantly the fear was back at her throat, stronger than before, a wave of sheer terror breaking over her. The tapping continued. And now it was accompanied by a hoarse whisper. “help… please help me…”.

  For a moment Beth thought of burying her head under her pillow, as she used to as child beset by night-time terrors. Then sanity prevailed, she got up, walked to the window, and pushed back the curtains.  


  The woman was there, doubled over and holding her stomach. Her long straggling hair hid her face from sight and yet Beth immediately felt she knew this woman well. She looked up at Beth and whispered again “help… please help me…”, and like her famous fictional forebear, reached up a hand to the windowsill. Beth could see only too well her bare arms which were scraped deeply and bleeding. The woman spoke again, her voice stronger, not whispering anymore “Beth, please… it’s me…just me”.

  Fear completely took over Beth’s fragile sanity. She stared at the hand gripping the windowsill, the knuckles white and spattered with darkness. She noticed the ring on her finger, and she had to recognize it- a gift from Jeremy to her. She had been wearing it that night when he ambushed and stabbed her outside her -what used to be their- apartment. She had screamed for help, and the homeless had indeed come up to them, but by then it had been too late."
qzo5hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qzo5hf/burn_for_humanity/,Burn for Humanity,37,3,1637595448.0,"Eyes clenched shut, Ariana breathed shallowly, as she listened in the still darkness of the bedroom she shared with her husband, Jon. A recently-emptied, five-gallon gas can rested by her right foot. In her left palm she grasped a book of matches; in her right hand: a single, unlit match. She wouldn’t strike it until she was fully certain. 

*You should hear a faint, leathery rubbing sound...maybe even hissing, if they’re big enough,* the doctor had told her that evening. Of course, they had been speaking over the phone, since there was “no way in hell” that Dr. Lima was getting anywhere near potentially-infected people. After all, if Jon was infected, then Ariana…

Ariana didn’t want to think about it. 

She held her breath--an easy feat in a room that reeked of gas fumes--and focused all her attention on the wheezing sounds coming from Jon’s open mouth, as he slept on their gas-soaked bed, oblivious to his wife’s recent activities. At first, Ariana could only hear the new, characteristic rhythm of Jon’s nighttime breathing. This was what had prompted her to call Dr. Lima--since Jon wouldn’t do it himself--but the doctor wouldn’t see potentially-infected patients. It was too risky. Dr. Lima--like the news media--argued in favor of the “heat treatment”. After all, “Burn for Humanity” was the catchphrase of the day.

The leathery rubbing sounds started up only a few seconds later; the hissing was much louder than she had expected it to be. Jon’s “lung eels” were probably huge, Medusa-grade things by now. Ariana guessed their diameter to be an inch or so around, but who knows how long? Seven inches? A foot? Longer? She would likely never know. She didn’t want to know. Ariana didn’t want to think about how many nights she slept beside Jon with those x-ray-invisible…*things*...silently emerging from their daytime hiding place, deep within Jon’s lungs, to undulate like their shy, sea-based cousins--the grass eels--above Jon’s gaping mouth. How many times had they delicately caressed her own skin and spewed their microscopic spore-eggs into her sleeping face? She shuddered at the thought, a river of ice flowing down her spine.

Yes, she’d unfortunately been right. There was nothing left but to burn it all.

Suddenly, the hissing stopped and there was a muffled slurping sound, as the eels quickly retracted into their lung burrows.

“Ariana?” Jon’s voice croaked. “Ariana? Why’s it smell like gas?” His voice brought so many memories of the good times they’d shared. She couldn’t listen to it; couldn’t let him stop her from breaking the chain of transmission.

Ariana struck the match in her hand against the matchbook in her other. When it flared up, she could see Jon’s gasoline-wet face.

“You don’t have to do this, my love. We can go away! We can go FAR AWAY from here! Please!” he begged, scrambling to untangle himself from the covers.

As they burned, the eels screamed much louder than Jon. For that, Ariana was briefly thankful."

Not to the point that I would start running, but enough to turn around numerous times thinking someone was there. But no one ever was.

Ofcourse no one is following me, I'm just being silly.

When I got to the corner infront of my house I suddenly heard some rapidly approaching sounds from behind me.

 As I turned around there was a sudden frigid wind blowing in my face forcing me to close my eyes, upon opening them I suddenly felt the urge to run home, not out of fear for myself but worry. 

Worry for my mom who has been alone all day while I was at school and soccer practice. 

I ran the short distance left to my house, unlocked the door and walked in... 

The house was cold. Not chilly, there was no difference between inside and outside the house. 

Struggling to conceal the panic in my voice I shouted through the house ""Mom?! Moom are you home?!"" 

I walked up the stairs and noticed that all windows to the back garden was wide open, as I went to close them a sudden sense of dread came upon me. 

Something made me think that if I look out those windows I'd never be the same... 

But the worry for my moms safety was reason enough to fight this dread and walk up to the window to reach for the handle.

I could see someone standing infront of the oak tree in our garden. I breath a sigh of relief and call out to mom telling her I'm home.

The figure in the garden turns around, but there are no facial features... Behind the creature I see my bloodied mom gasping for air.

She told me it began when she was young. A cut on her finger plopped into her mouth. The coppery twang started something that would engulf her life. 

People dismissed her as a freak. Her parents tried therapy but that didn't last long once her parents died in a horrible accident. No longer bound by the shackles of home life she began to explore different varieties. 

I first noticed Hannah's dysfunction when she cut her arm and sucked at the blood, eyes rolling in ecstasy. I thought it was weird at first, until she beckoned me to try it, saying how lovely hers tasted. I don't know why I did it. It was something about her eyes. Luring me in. Telling me without words that it was what I wanted. 

I wasn't sold. The bitter twang felt wrong. Tasted wrong. But I wanted to make my goddess happy. It was the only time I did it. 

However, over time I found I started to crave it. Needed the fix of blood like I needed to breathe. 

I learnt the reason why. Hannah had been putting in cups of blood from her body in my food. Freshly collected from her time of the month. 

I became as hooked as she was. 

One night while we drank at a local bar, a man slurred over to her. His grin widened at her low cut top. She pushed him away and I stood, chest thrust out like a peacock. 

""You don't want any of this, boy!"" Barked the man. 

But he was wrong. I did. 

""Take it outside! You ain't fighting in my bar,"" shouted the gun toting barman. 

So we did. Him and two of his friends. My nerves fled when the cold hit me. The bolstering alcohol fled to a dark corner of my mind. Hannah came out of nowhere. Took one out before he knew what hit him. The leering man came at me, but I deflected his punch and slammed a palm up his nose cracking bone. The other man fled. 

As the blood glistened over his face, I found my knees sinking to the ground. Tongue inching out. Snaking a drop on the tip. Tasting the sweet scent on my buds. Hannah drank from a head wound. Our eyes met. 

Every week we go out to start a fight. Most of the time we are left to enjoy our new ritual. But tonight the cops came and locked us up. She smiles from her cell at me. The other women crowd in a corner, just like the men in mine. 

It's like a banquet just for us."

Cloying. Putrid. Cloying. Putrid. 

Amity stared at me from down the table and I watched the candlelight dance across the sheen of fat on her wrinkled lips. 

“Paul, care to tell what you’re thankful for?” Her voice rasped as tiny bubbles gathered at the corners of her mouth. 

*Blinking, exhaling*, I thought, but managed, “F-family?”  

She returned a tight spasm of a smile.

“You haven’t touched your turkey, Paul. Don’t be rude.”  

I looked down at my plate, suddenly keen to avoid the vibrating contempt in her small black eyes. The meat was grey, indistinct, pocked by the larval cradles of the dozen flies that now buzzed around the table. 

*It’s not my dog anymore*, I thought, *It’s turkey. It’s not my—*

“RUDE!” she suddenly spat through clenched teeth. 

I jumped, gasping sharply, catching an undertone of mothballs and rubbing alcohol in the enveloping miasma. She had already eaten half of the…*turkey*. The slippery yellow *mashed potatoes*—a pudgy product of too much kibble—had given the errant hairs on her chin a glistening stiffness. 

“Mmm, ma’am. Yuh—“ I retched, swallowing rising bile with the smallest bite I could manage. “Yummy.”

*It’s not my dog—not Calliope.*

Amity glowered and tapped her tar-stained fingernails on the table. “All of it, Paul. The pain I put into this meal...”

“It’s just so…filling.”  I felt something wriggle on the inside of my cheek and found it with my molars. It died with an acrid pop. My stomach twisted, trying to return the stringy lump of meat I had forced down. Amity watched on. 

She was my mother, but only by blood. What love she showed me was soured by sadistic codependency, a need to prove to me that she was everything I needed or deserved. 

I swallowed another clotted bite and gagged. 

Calliope was my dog for this year, a small mutt, a rescue. Every Christmas, Amity would give me a new one and every following Thanksgiving, she’d demonstrate that *her* affection was the only kind that persisted. I tried not to like Calliope. I hadn’t been successful. 

“I’m not stupid, Paul...”

“M-ma’am?”

She struggled to light her first post-meal cigarette, talking around the filter. “You’re 14. Not a boy anymore. I know about your little girlfriend, your secret pocket-phone.”

She drew on the cigarette and sighed a puff of smoke. “You wanna be rid of me. Make a love nest somewhere.”

A quiet bark sounded from Amity’s side of the table—*Calliope’s*. 

“Well, Paul, I did you a favor.”

My eyes shot to the meat. 

When I looked up, Amity had rolled her wheelchair from behind the table. Calliope nestled in her lap. 

*The meat—not my dog*...  

Calliope pulled at one of the bloody stumps where Amity’s legs used to be. 

*…not my girlfriend either.*

“You want me gone, Paul? Keep eating.”"

Her voice is cold as steel, emotionless. She is getting less sympathetic to my plight.

I shift uncomfortably in my seat. “I don’t know. It just comes over me.”

Zena interlocks her fingers together. Her eyes bore into mine.

“You know it’s wrong. You told me this repeatedly today…”

She’s saying a lot more, but it is all blending together in a monotonous stream. Images are flooding my mind, daydreams of my psychologist lying in a pool of her own blood on the ground, her limbs twisted grotesquely like an Egyptian hieroglyph.

I shove the images away, force myself back on Earth. Zena is right. These daydreams are getting dangerous.

Still, my fingers are itching. It’s been too long since I got that *thrill*.

“Paige, are you listening?”

I take a deep, shaky breath. “Yeah. Maybe.”

Zena fixes me another steely glare. “As I was saying, take a deep breath. Control it. This isn’t right. This isn't normal.”

*Don’t.*  begs the voice in my head.  *Let’s be free.*

And after minutes of sitting there squirming, the words echoing and dancing around my head, I finally break free. I finally escape.

I lunge forward, my hands closing around Zena’s neck. Her soft, pulpy flesh feels like Play-Doh in my hands. I squeeze, sighing in pleasure, as Zena’s eyes bulge and blood rushes to her cheeks. Her mouth bursts open like a fish, gasping for air.

Finally I let go. Zena’s dead body crashes on her desk, and something made of glass--a glass prism, I think-- tumbles and shatters onto the floor.

I pick up a shard and trace it on Zena’s neck. Warm blood trickles out and drips onto the floor.

Then I dip my fingers in and write in crimson ink:

𝓘 𝓴𝓲𝓵𝓵𝓮𝓭 𝓱𝓮𝓻. 𝓘 𝓵𝓸𝓿𝓮 𝓲𝓽.

Over and over again on the desk.  It feels strangely satisfying.

The wail of sirens bring me back to my senses. Someone must have heard the glass and called the police.  I freeze, blood still dripping off my fingertips.

*What am I doing? Why can’t I control it, for once?*

Satisfying or not, it is still wrong. I just can’t help myself. I can’t stop doing it. First my best friend, and so many other people besides, before I met my psychologist. I thought Zena could help me, but now she's dead. Just like the rest of them.

I turn away, my body shaking into sobs as the door crashes open."

She shuts her eyes and takes in everything around her; the feel of the air on her skin, the warmth of the sun on her bare back. The smell, soft with cologne of sandalwood and perfume of jasmine. A hint of paprika from last night's dinner, and the alcohol from the bottle of red wine still sitting on the marbled kitchen counter in the other room. The more subtle scent of the lilacs, sitting in their vase, dying petals lying around it's base.

She strokes his skin, gently. Not wanting to wake him. She takes note of every freckle she can see on his back. Anyone else would see a random smattering, varying shades of brown, but to her it was a fragmented trace-the-dots of their entire relationship. A constellation of every kiss, every touch. Every time they said 'I love you', but also every word spoken in anger, borne from hatred of the other. Burning passion, she thinks. And every fire must be doused. Eventually.

They shine through on his exposed skin, she follows their path softly. Enshrouded in the white cotton of their bed, with the bright splashes of poppies and roses on the sheets she chose, she thinks to herself 'sheet hogger once, and always'. Never a gentle sleeper, a soft sleeper, she thinks. She smiles. The early daylight from the Venetian blinds behind her makes everything look magical, dusky. Soft.

She looks down, starts stroking him. She feels every ridge, every imperfection. Her fingers trace along what she can feel, the soft smile still on her face. Her other hand moves softly through his hair, still wet, and she reminds herself she has to be gentle. He'll be mad if I wake him, she thinks, and then she'll get mad. It's okay though - he's a heavy sleeper.

The dust motes in the air scurry, drift. Moving quickly, but still moving so slowly she can follow each with her eyes. The hand in his hair moves, in front of her face, and the dust in the air follows her movement. She tries to follow them, grab them, but they are gone before she can even think to close her hand. Fleeting, she thinks. Beautiful but quick to leave, just like true love.

The front door opens, a flurry of swirling dust in the morning sun. She startles, and she grabs him with both hands. Cold skin in her hands, heavy. She waits. The footsteps come closer, her breathing grows increasingly fast until she feels she may hyperventilate. Jasmine, sandalwood and the harsh, sickening alcohol flood her senses. Soon overpowered by the insidious stench of iron, of death, that she was ignoring before.

She barely hears the shots; already mostly deafened by the earlier ones. Instead, she watches the gentle puffs of smoke, whirling through the light. The mist of red, blooming from where the bullets find their final mark. She falls, gasping, her face still a priceless picture of shock, of horror.

I drop him, the gun, its muzzle sizzling in the blood already draped on the floor. I turn to him, my him, and gently stroke his hair again as I listen to her breath, rattling through her broken body. I'm glad I pieced his skull together again, at least as best as I could.

I hear her final gurgle, and think again about how this was all her fault. All hers."

&#x200B;

I had already pulled open most of the kitchen drawers, there was just one left to search...

&#x200B;

Let's backtrack by just five-minutes.

&#x200B;

I slowly pulled the drawer to the old and dusty cabinet in our living-room with hesitation. This was the drawer of everything; cables, old and new batteries, receipts from three years ago, and it was also where my Mother kept her cigarettes.

&#x200B;

An open pack lay haphazardly in the centre, casually slung in there with the rest of the junk. One cigarette was already missing. I quickly grabbed them before I lost my nerve, besides, the pressure from my older twin brothers was just too overwhelming. They beat me in both age and size.

&#x200B;

""Such a pussy..."" Ben whispered to Tim.

&#x200B;

""I know...I bet he won't do it..."" Tim added. They were hiding between the doorway of the living-room and the stairway, whispering, but they did it loud enough so they knew I could hear too.

&#x200B;

My parents were sound asleep in bed upstairs, and I was scared of them catching me, but, I was more terrified of my brothers. I had been a pawn in their many, *many* games, since the day I was born.

&#x200B;

""Come on!!"" Tim egged me on from the doorway.

&#x200B;

""Yeah, come on! Hurry up and light it, pussy!"" Ben joined in.

&#x200B;

I was becoming more and more anxious by the second. My vision turned slightly blurry, and I wobbled on the spot.

&#x200B;

""*Hurry, up!*"" Ben hissed at me. Both their faces screamed ultimate pain if I did not comply.

&#x200B;

I had to click the lighter multiple times before I got it to work. I put the cigarette to my lips and pulled the flame in close. The moment I tried to draw air into my lungs, my throat suddenly closed up.

&#x200B;

Instant panic set in and I clawed at my neck in frightful desperation.

&#x200B;

The lighter fell to the floor with a smash, the cigarette quickly followed, and then me on my knees not long after.

&#x200B;

I felt as though I was breathing threw a straw that had then been clamped shut in the middle. My eyes felt blood shot and swollen, like they were starting to bulge from their sockets.

&#x200B;

I knew there was one in the kitchen somewhere, my parents put one in here after the last time. But, *where the fuck is it?!*

&#x200B;

For the life of me, I couldn't find it...Just one drawer left.

&#x200B;

Tiny splutters was all that I could manage as I lay twitching and gasping for oxygen on the cold kitchen tiles. My brother's had disappeared from the doorway and I was praying it was to get our parents, but, they never returned. They were hiding in their beds.

&#x200B;

In my final moments, I managed to reach up and pull the last drawer open. My inhaler *had* to be here...

&#x200B;

The only item I found was a tiny note, written by my brothers;

&#x200B;

*'You'll never find it!'*"

My bed is my safe place, it's stench of stale sweat, crumbs stabbing my back and memory foam with some level trauma all act as my warm prison. 

I avoid the plague of minds outside, sometimes the ones who infiltrate my phone. When I see them, I know they see me. Play peek a boo under your covers or else they'll see you.

I no longer see humans as for who they are but as for what I am not. 

I see their talent, charm, love, kindness and good-will. 

I see their success and further ventures.

More importantly, I see my lack of such.

I stand by them as the sunset casts me to the ground, I can be seen, I can follow but I am not me or I am a byproduct of wants meant to be. 

I see them thrive in chats, jokes I lack context, their joy I cannot rejoice, their pain I cannot comfort. 

My safety is a prison, I watch her in the dark. 

Always crawling closer but never reaching me

Her stench more retching but I never gag 

Her creaks louder but I never hear.

She sprawls out of the light but I see her

Her limbs are stopped at bloodied, brazen points. No hands, no forearms, no feet

Her hair limp, lifeless and thinning clinging to her bloodied skin. 

She clicks her head in place to move the hair from her face, away from her eye.

Looking blood shot many times over, a singular eye covers the face. The pupil dilutes when she catches sight of me.

Dancing in the white and red of the eye and shaking when focused, it is something you cannot bear to turn away from. 

I run from the world into this personal hell. 

She lacks limbs, taste, smell, speech and hearing. 

She doesn't have need for them 

Just the ability to see me

I'm a foreigner living in the US. My girlfriend told me excitedly that she was super happy to introduce me to her family. I thought we'd go to her house and have a normal dinner together. Of course she didn't mention it was the day of an important holiday. Here's the thing; I always heard of Thanksgiving but I never knew when it was. In my mind it was the 4th of July but I was wrong. That's what happens when you've lived in Eastern Europe most of your life. So imagine my surprise when she invited me into her parents house just to be received by the whole family. From grandparents to little humans. I lost the words for those little things… children! Yeah the loud creatures are called children.

  Everybody seemed sweet. I could tell by just being near them. They were warm and welcoming. They asked me questions. The usual questions a family asks to the boyfriend of their youngest daughter. Nothing out of line so I was feeling bad about it since they were sweet. Except for the father. Typical tough New York asshole with no filter. My girl seemed embarrassed but I handled it. I've dealt with thousands of people like him. He was the only one who smelled like shit though. I wasn't gonna feel bad about him for sure. 

  Dinner went ok. I couldn't eat meat but I drank some wine. Nobody seemed to care that I wasn't eating the turkey. Nobody except my girlfriend. She was definitely not ok with it. I could tell she was feeling ashamed about the fact I wasn't eating the food her mom made with love. I could see she wanted to show off her mom's cooking abilities. The love they had for each other was awesome. She loved her family. It was so endearing. So for her I decided to not prolong what I was there to do. 

  Out of respect and for the appreciation I felt for someone who could love like that I snapped her neck first. And then fastly knocked everyone out. 

  I had a feast that night. 11 people. Their blood was so good. I could finally understand why she loved them. Of course I couldn't drink the father's blood. It smelled bitter from a mile away so I just tied him up and left him to burn inside the house.

  I knew I didn't need to burn the evidence. No one would think vampires are running around killing people. It's always blamed on the poor wolves. But what can you expect from a human mind? I think I want to go to another thanksgiving dinner. If I run fast I can make it to California. They're three hours behind. All I need to find is a big family getting ready for dinner and a welcome mat on their front door.

  Careful who you willingly or unwillingly invite into your house next Thanksgiving.

  Or if you've had enough… just let me in."

I grab the “monster spray”, which is nothing more than water. As I spray it under the bed and in the closet, I sing, “Oogie boogie woogie woo, go away monsters! We’re not scared of you!”. 

She giggles, and then snuggles down under the covers. Even though I put on a show, I still like to remind her that monsters aren’t real, and there’s nothing to be scared of in the dark. 

I flip off the light and stumble my way across the room in the pitch black. 

One step, two steps, three steps and a smell similar to rotten eggs hits my nose. “What is that smell? Oh great, we’re going to die from a gas leak. I’ll need to call the gas company in the morning.”, I think to myself. 

Four steps, five steps, and I bump into something rather…solid? I quietly say to myself, “but the bed is eight steps away…what could this be?” I turn around, intending to flip the light back on, when I hear a deep, growling voice say, “The spray didn’t work…”"
qz3z2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qz3z2s/ok_boomer/,OK Boomer,2048,68,1637527435.0,"I woke up strapped to a medical chair, facing an elderly man with a crooked back and deep wrinkles. There were two IV bags between us. And as they slowly drained, pain seeped into my bones.

I knew what was happening. I was undergoing the ‘reboot’ procedure.

The so-called miracle treatment started as a sick experiment. Daniel Ingram was the first recipient. Neither he nor his granddaughter had long to live—her lung cancer was terminal, and he had sixty years of whiskey and cigars to answer for—so it’s not like either of them had much to lose.

Daniel skipped out of hospital with the vigor of a man half his age while his granddaughter died on the operating table. You can imagine what happened next: boomers discovering they could pass on their aches and ailments to the *next* generation? It was only ever going to end one way…

First, they showed up at children’s wards to guilt-trip the parents of sick kids. “What difference will it make? They’re pretty much dead already.”

From there, things only escalated. Reports flew of unmarked vans abducting children in the middle of the night. Kids started turning up to school with thinning hair and liver spots.

The President promised swift action. Until a photo of *her* getting the procedure done leaked on Twitter. Then her stance suddenly changed to, “The reboot treatment is completely safe for all parties.”

90% of our politicians were boomers. Of course they were never gonna help.

Before long those under the age of twenty abandoned the major cities and set up protected shantytowns. The boomers threw a shit fit. The values of their second homes tanked and they couldn’t find anybody to work a job that required a good set of knees and a strong back. Or which paid less than $30 an hour.

But did they take it sitting down? Fuck no.

The narrative became ‘isolated communities are infested with crime and a danger to the entire nation’. Soon armored vehicles rammed the gates and dragged us away, kicking and screaming.

And it didn’t stop there. Oh no. The procedure soon became *mandatory*.

“It would be irresponsible for our youth to sit back watching the greatest generation suffer,” they said.

Those of us who refused to go along with it—like me, for instance—were thrown into a black ambulance and plopped in front of a wrinkly fuck.

When the IV bag was almost completely drained, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I screamed.

“Calm down snowflake,” the man said.

“My back. It hurts.”

“That’s cause you sit around playing video games all day.”

“My eyes. I…I can’t see.”

“Try not staring at your phone so much.”

When the procedure was finished, he jumped up and clicked his heels.

“You bastard,” I rasped. It was an awful, liquid wheeze. “Look what you’ve done to me.”

“See, that’s the problem with your generation,” he sneered. “Always blaming someone else for their problems.”"

She did not respond to his cries or prods. She wasn't breathing. She had no pulse. Amid rising panic, he fumbled for his phone and called 911.

The operator picked up at the first ring. ""911, What is your emergency?""

""Um, um, um, my ma's not breathing! She's not moving, and-""

""Please give me your location and we'll send someone out right away."" Connor gave his address. ""Thank you. Please stay on the line. You said your mother is sitting up?""

Connor nodded, then realized that wasn't useful. ""Uh-huh. Yes."" He put the phone on speaker and laid it on the table.

""Good. Now what I want you to do is reach for the back of her neck, and find the highest vertebra, a little bump at the top of the spine. Can you find it?""

""Yeah. Yeah.""

""Now I want you to use your thumb and push it in firmly, toward the center of her neck. Don't worry about pushing too hard.""

""What is this going to do?""

""Help is on the way, but doing this may save her life.""

Connor had never heard of anything like this, but the operator seemed completely calm and competent. He took a breath and pushed the bone inward. There was a disturbing click sound, but the bone popped back up. It seemed like he had not broken anything.

""Nothing's happening,"" Connor said, checking his mother's face for signs of life. ""Oh wait wait! Her eyes opened!""

""Good. Be patient, though, she may take several seconds to become alert.""

""What did it do?"" His mother's straight-ahead stare still seemed empty of life.

""Please watch her; she might be disoriented for a moment.""

A few more agonizing seconds passed; and then his mother looked at him and smiled. He leaned forward and hugged her, tears in his eyes.

His mother hugged him back, then leaned over to the phone. ""I'm awake.""

All our worries, all the threats facing us, and yet we never anticipated that our very capacity for joy could be taken away. Theories abounded, from a foreign weapon, to a disease, to aliens. There was no way to tell.


It didn't take long before the mass suicides began. People snapped under the weight of their loss, knowing innately that there was no going back. Scientists scrambled, working tirelessly to find the source. But with no happiness, no drive, their efforts were doomed from the start. How can a person work with no motivation? How do you persevere through the greyness to achieve the impossible?


There were only a few unaffected humans left, cloistered underground. Was the condition contagious? Nobody knew. People just...stopped feeling. Keeping humanity segregated from the dulls above was the only way to be sure.


The final three, the rest either dead by their own hand or by execution by the others out of fear, languished in their tiny concrete bunker. Terrified, knowing that at any point their ability to even be so afraid would likely evaporate into an abyss of non-feeling. 


Crying, they huddled together in a corner, the single light bulb flickering overhead. One by one they fell asleep, and when they awoke, it was all over. Their terror gone, their hope, left. 


They each took turns with the handgun, deadpan, no more tears. 


Just like that humanity was no more, and the world fell silent. "

Now look at me. My decrepit, puny old body glares back at me in the bathroom mirror. Deep wrinkles overtaking all that I had worked for. My arms, once thick like mighty oak trees, have wasted away to matchsticks. My face, so handsome, now a wretched spectre of the man I once was.


I light up another sloppily rolled smoke, my hands shaking as I struggle with the cheap lighter. I grunt as I exhale, my scornful expression being all that remains of my former self, the *real* me. I long for the days gone by when I could function without constant pain or the fear of a fall, of which could easily be my last.


At least I still have my memories. 


I carefully make my way to the kitchen, opening the cupboard under the sink and removing a hidden panel in the back. The glossy mahogany box feels smooth under my wilting fingers as I pull it out, comforting, like home.


I snap the lid off, revealing my keepsakes. I fiddle with the snippings of hair, rubbing them between my fingertips, trying to recapture those moments. So many, yet I'll never experience it again. The hunt, the thrill, and then when it's all over the addition to my collection.

I then asked Brian whether I should stop torturing the man living on the streets and Brian would say no. I then asked Brian whether I should free the souls I had gained through dodgy deals, and Brian would say no.

I take them home with me everyday”,69,2,1637505252.0,"  I can’t help it. Look at them, so innocent, but already going through much. I think about them all night, how to help them more than just maths and reading. 

What is the point of teaching them addition and subtraction, when I know they are hurting? How can I expect them to learn? 

These parents are smart, there are no visible bruises, yet, and after what I went through at the last school, I won’t be reporting even if I did see bruises. I’ll help them myself. 

And it’s not just physical pain, even though I know that’s happening. Look at how Ali flinches every time an adult walks by. And Lexi- not much better. Her hair is so messy, she would have such pretty hair if someone combed it - in two little pigtails, maybe? I picked up these butterfly clips for her hair – I saw them and thought they would go so well in her beautiful hair but I know I can’t give it to her. I’ll keep them with the other stuff I bought. 

And that’s not the worse. It’s not the hunger- I know so many of them are hungry, just watch how they wolf down the school meals. I know they go to bed hungry- I’ve seen them- I’ve looked up their addresses and followed them home because a good teacher needs to care holistically about her pupils, not just when they’re in her classroom. I know they don’t have regular mealtimes with proper food, I’ve seen their mothers slap down a plastic dish with gummy bears and uncooked hotdogs in front of them, and that’s when they’re lucky and she remembers. 

Terrible people, none of them deserve to have kids for a minute. How they are allowed to keep them is beyond me. Somebody needs to do something about it. 

Yesterday I saw Nick had forgotten his backpack, and so I took it back for him, it is almost on my way anyway. I knocked on the door, and his mother opened, all glammed up even though it was only 4 o’clock. She couldn’t even recognize me, she was so out of it. What kind of parent doesn’t know their kid’s teacher? I introduced myself and gave Nick’s backpack to her. Instead of thanking me, she just looked confused, held the backpack like she didn’t even know what it was, then slammed the door in my face. How does she have a sweet kid like Nick is just cruel. 

I talked to Roya and Tanya’s mom today- they were having some issues with hurting other children, although I know they are just mimicking what they see at home. That is where it starts, right? Everyone knows that, it starts at the home. I just broke down and cried – it was useless.

If the children didn’t need me so bad, I’d end it today, taking them with me."

Sitting in the bath, the house all nice and quiet

No ticking from the clocks, the cars have all gone silent 

So you let you head slip down underneath the suds

But suddenly you hear it, over the pumping of your blood.


Can you hear the tapping coming from the pipes?

Can you hear the scuttling from something out of sight?

Maybe you can't see it but I just need to warn

It's creeping in the corners prepared to do you harm


Can you hear it spinning, silvery web like thread?

Catch the last buzz, before all the flies are dead.

But that was not enough to appease this wretched beast

And it's just not done eating yet, not even in the least 


And as you re-emerge, slick with foam and bubbles.

You have a funny feeling, you really are in trouble.

Reaching for your towel, your arm stops  mid air.

And it's now tangled in a Web that was waiting there.


You jump up in a hurry, but your legs are soon stuck too.

You are just hanging helpless, upside down in the nude.

And as you feel the tremors, you let out a little cry.

The spider is quite hungry and now you're the tasty fly."

As such all of her matrilineal line bore ill man's laws;
Never did her ancestral matrons their natural durations survive,
All hung and felled under punitive causes men usually contrive.
Her own predecessor, who many Wallenstein's wounded healed
Was by the same general executed for witchcraft she purportedly revealed.

No, Euxine intended not for herself the path
Where the erstwhile womanhood met men's wrath.
Since she learnt of her sad familial chronicle
Fought to shed herself of her clan's manacles,
To Christian god she supplicated, knelt and prayed before a crucifix
(But couldn't enter the church for the flock with her kind refused to mix),
Shunned pagan lore and longed for salvation
Thought to be promised to that old Abramic nation.
Though she gave whispering heaths a wide berth
The onset of possessing grasp she felt from earth,
She knew what it was, too, though she'd not admit it
For the impious soul within was demanding she must feed it.

T'was in dusky hours of one morn yet under darkly heap
A voice from the hearth rose unto Eudoxine asleep,
""Euxine, Euxine, arise my dear offspring,
From Hade I come to Psyche's lantern bring.""
Waking with a start Euxine called to the strange visitor,
""Who is it that speaks sets my heart and belly aflutter?""
""I'm Teuta, the first sage of your enchanted line.
I've heard your torment to embrace the God they call divine""
""My dear ancestress, long ere I resolved to free
My branch off, sprout anew far from this cursed tree;
I wish not the wrongs my mother and hers had so endured
Befall my life; thus, of this damnation I seek to be cured.""
Teuta replied, ""True much unjust attrition did the bodies and spirits
Of my daughters defile, whose blood could fill hell's pits.
Child, neither some Auric gods nor Archaic Magic
Fixed our lot upon the travails ever so tortuous and tragic.
But it's earthly men, their unchanging purpose,
Set each life to its peculiar form and course,
Shall make you become that which they command,
To bend to the power rules not heaven but the land.
Those to slavery born their father's fetters inherit on their necks,
Heathen issues weather Bishops' whips struck their parents backs,
Beggar's children birth beggars ever more,
Servant's infants grow kneeing on the floor.
Thus, by no prayer or blessing can you veer
From witch's destiny you must now near.
T'is but the life such as all of man's dominion must maintain
Against which no otherworldly measures pertain.
If there be, indeed, a curse, it is no other than
That your life during cruel era of man began.""
The ghost, then, no more spoke,
As morning the augury broke.

Late that evening a stray dog walked
Into Euxine's yard, the gate unlocked,
Wondering what that large lump heedlessly
Swinging from an orange blossom tree might be."

I met Basil at the local park. None of the other kids would even look at me let alone talk to me. Basil was my first real friend. 

I got why the other kids didn't like him. He was misshapen. His nose was crooked. He had a squinty eye. And he had a birthmark that covered his face and upper body. Oh, and he didn't have a mouth. Just a small hole that he talked through. 

When the skate park kids came passed they would always shout insults at him, like ass mouth, or turd boy, because of his birthmark. It upset him to no end. 

I told him not to listen to them. Why bother? They were just bullies. But, he just couldn't let it go. One day while we were sitting swinging our legs off the side of the bench, I told him about my bullies. They had alienated me because my mum died. Picked on me because I was always sad. But, I got my revenge. 

His eyes pricked up when I told him. His squinty eye opened a fraction more at the details. Even his hole-mouth stretched a little wider. When it was time to leave, Basil had a look in his eyes I had never seen before. One of conviction. 

The next day Basil wasn't at the park. The other kids left me be. They didn't see me on the bench. Didn't bother to insult me like they did Basil. Bored, I thought I'd have a little fun with Basil's bullies. I had been bullied and came out the other side. I didn't care what they thought of me or what they said to me. 

One boy was just about to take the big ramp where I was standing. I waited until just the right time and pushed him while he was mid air. The crash was spectacular. Blood grazed his knees and his face. It was epic. I was only sad Basil never got to see it. 

Then I heard a grunting and turned to see Basil standing at the gate. Mouth hooting in laughter. The kids didn't see him now. Like they didn't see me. See I told Basil how I killed one of my bullies. I was distraught with what I had done and begged him not to do the same. Because I understood that although he was dead, he couldn't suffer like they had done to me. 

I came up with a plan to ended my life so I could torture the others. Basil loved that idea. Now we torture our bullies together."

I never got why people loved cranberry sauce with turkey. 

We spend Thanksgiving with Grandma, who lives on a bad side of town. It’s one of those neighbourhoods we’re not allowed to stop in for any reason until we arrive, and I Spy gets a little depressing with amount of missing kid, missing dog, missing wife posters. 

But Grandma makes it worth it. When we arrive with our limp Tupperware green beans, we’re met with Grandma’s kitchen at full power. The oven holds a golden, crispy Titanic sized turkey. The rack above it, homemade rolls are brushed with butter. Mashed potatoes are piled a mile high, with boatloads of delicious gravy.

The only part of the meal I dislike is Cousin Neil’s homemade cranberry sauce. Fruit or jellied, it always tastes foul. One year it was too sweet, one year it was too bitter. One year, I swore he’d used rotten cranberries. Because Cousin Neil lives with Grandma- she is very protective of him and insists everyone have some. If you don’t, you’ll get the Grandma Eye. If you don’t know what that is, it is a look that would strike fear into even the coldest heart. 

Finally, the meal I look forward to most each year has arrived. We all pull up our chairs. Grandma insists on serving me an ungodly amount of food, which looks absolutely salivating until a great big slather of cranberry sauce is thrown on top. 

Cousin Neil comes in, back out from the shed outside. His apron is stained with cranberries. He piles himself an enormous plate, then shrugs into his chair. He digs into the mashed potato and cranberry to take a mouthful. 

“Neil, dear.” Grandma reminds him gently “It *is* Thanksgiving.” 

Neil puts down his fork with an annoyed growl. That’s always how Neil is. I think I’ve only ever heard him speak a full sentence twice in his life. 

We turn off the lights and light the candles around the table in the right procession.  

“Oh, dear.” Grandma smiles as I struggle into my robes “You’re getting a little big, darling!” 

The cranberry sauce is set in the middle of the table as we link hands, our hoods of our dark robes covering our eyes. Neil places a poster of a missing child around my own age under the cranberry pot. 

“Bless us, dear ancient one, as we have done your rapture.” Grandma spoke pleasantly “May you look down on the work we have done and smile upon this good deed. May we continue to purge this earth of all we deem unworthy. Leave us be.” 

“Leave us be.” We all repeat. 

As I’m eating, I wince through most of the cranberry sauce as it squishes and squashes inside my mouth. I still don’t understand why my family are so ravenous for it, especially when Uncle Tom picked out a shard of bone between his teeth with a laugh. But Grandma says I’ll grow into liking it. All the family do."

I wander from room to room gazing at the items that had brought me so much joy throughout my life. I walked into our bedroom and couldn't help but smile as I gazed down at a small music box that he bought me for our one year wedding anniversary. It played the song that had been played as our first dance, and I always used to play it when I wanted to remember happier times. 

I heard the front door open downstairs and knew that the two demonic creatures had returned. I walked down to the living room and found my son and daughter in law sitting on the couches, and deciding what they were going to with their inheritance.

I know this sounds terrible but I have hated my son for most of his life. He was a horrible child who took every opportunity to disrespect me. His wife was no better as it is obvious that she only married him for his money. I have even begun to suspect that they might have been responsible for my death.

I started to feel weak and knew that my connection to this world was beginning to fade once again. It has become harder and harder to keep my spectral form, and I believe that eventually I will fade away altogether. I let out a sigh and hope this isn't my last time to return.

But then, I thought of checking behind the TV, where it was plugged in. So I got up with difficulty and walked over to the TV. Behind it, stood hundreds of mangled cords. I saw the white one was connected directly to the socket at the bottom, so I took it out to plug it back in. 

Just before I plugged it back in, I heard a giggle. A shrill, soft giggle. Not from behind me, not from my right or my left, not even from above me, but right *in front of me*.

I look into the socket and my blood turns into ice as I see an *eye*. An actual eye, staring at me from inside the socket. I feel myself go stiff, then, with no warning, a shriek erupts from my throat as I fall backward onto the couch. 

The TV suddenly turns on and displayed in front of me in the TV is a giant face with white, white skin, huge, bloodshot eyes, and a mouth as wide as my arm, its teeth wickedly sharp and bloody.

I wasn't able to make the post as I didn't have access to a computer while on vacation last week. Unfortunately, while on I-4 in Orlando (apparently this is a road everyone should avoid at all costs) my wife and I got into a pretty (Trigger warning if you don't like seeing smashed vehicles) [serious car accident](https://twitter.com/rafael_gravy/status/1460321171673694215). While we were completely stopped in traffic, someone not paying attention slammed into the back of our car, sending us across two lanes of traffic into the break down lane. Mrs. Gravy took the brunt of the impact as she was driving, but we both came away from this with only minor injuries. Mrs. Gravy's face was cut by shattered glass, her left arm was servery bruised, and for the next few days after she was incredibly sore. 

I, on the other hands, only walked away with some bruised ribs, a minor cut on my head, and my neck was super sore from the seat belt choking me. Our car was completely totaled, though. Our luggage was destroyed as well which included my laptop and Kindle, along with my wife's iPad. 

All this is just a long-winded explanation to say that I wasn't able to get the posting up in time and the original posting was copied and pasted from a couple years past. This will be the correct posting to reflect the current situation regarding the prizes as the original included material which I cannot give out.

While I do try to be comical and light-hearted with these announcements, I'd just like to take a moment to say what I am thankful for. I am thankful for making it out of this accident with only the minor injuries we had. I'm thankful for the Toyota's excellent safety features. I'm thankful for the people who stopped on the side of the road to make sure we were okay. I'm thankful for the EMTs, nurses, and doctors who braved the Covid-19 epidemic last year and who were on staff to check on my wife and I after the accident. I'm thankful for our families and friends who helped us out during this mess. I'm thankful to be alive. This whole thing could have ended up differently.

And now that I've said my thanks, I hope you're ready to get real scary for this Thanksgiving Contest!

_______________

Do you hear that sound? It is as if millions of voice suddenly garbled in terror, and were suddenly silenced. I fear something delicious is happening...

Once again, it is time for our annual Thanksgiving celebration!

Travelers will brave the perils of airport security, traffic jams, and getting stuck behind little old ladies who can barely see over the steering wheel to see the families they've avoided seeing the whole year.

Once more, Macy's will fill hot air balloons and parade them down the streets of New York and millions will watch on television as if this was *actually* entertaining. It's not. It's people walking, cars driving by, and stupid hot air balloons. Fight me.

And who could forget the greatest Thanksgiving tradition? Awkwardly sitting around the dinner table trying to get super drunk and avoid the topics of politics, social issues, or Battlefield 2042's terrible launch only to have your drunk uncle bring up all three in a manner of seconds. How he did it, I don't know, but bless his drunken soul, he certainly made his position known even if it was incoherent and a tad bit on the racist/sexist side. We still love him because it's only once a year we see him. I swear, this isn't me venting. I promise.

Let's indulge ourselves in a feast of bite-sized horror stories revolving around our tastiest avian genocide holiday with a contest!

For example, during our [r/SleepSpell](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepSpell/) competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged exactly as the search I listed.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winners circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winners circle due ties and multiple placements.

“We are real sorry to hear that Molly,” our facilitator Wesley responded.

My vision turned fuzzy, and I fell over onto the floor. The other men joined me like falling dominoes. Darkness seeped in.

When I awoke, I found myself in the front passenger side of Molly’s car; she was driving. The other three guys from our meeting were in the backseat launching a barrage of obscene language at Molly. I could not move my arms or legs, felt paralyzed from the neck down. 

Molly sped through a dirt road in the woods. With one hand on the wheel, her other hand tilted a whiskey bottle and let the liquor flow through her beat-red face.

“What have you done to us?” I murmured. “Where are you taking us?”

I looked down at my chest and noticed my seatbelt was not on. 

“You guys okay?” I craned my neck to get a good look at them. Their seatbelts were also not fastened.

We were moving dangerously fast, swerving closely to the trees on the sides of the road. 

“You are the scum of the Earth, you know that right? I had a good life with Will. Alcohol is the Devil’s poison. Never had a drink in my life until my poor Will was taken from me. And look at me now, I can’t get enough of it.”

Molly pushed her foot on the accelerator. The five seconds that followed felt like a lifetime. My weightless body floated towards the windshield. The men behind me tumbled in the air like monkeys in a barrel. I rolled across the hood of the car and connected with a tree, breaking my back in the process.

Wesley passed away on the spot. The other two guys survived with major injuries. As for Molly—the whiskey bottle impaled her. Shards of bottle glass did a number inside her mouth. 

Unfortunately, I picked up drinking again."

How could he sleep with all the terrifying thoughts rushing through his head. He found himself glimpsing over at the wardrobe, certain that the thing that watches him as he sleeps was going to come out. He had checked inside the wardrobe before he got into bed, it was empty. But Henry knew it was there hidden in the realm of shadows.


The thunder grew louder, and the rain more fierce upon his window. Henry knew it wouldn't pop out from the wardrobe, not while he was awake anyway. It thrived on vulnerability, and what better time to strike than when your prey is sleeping. He had sensed it's presence, felt it's gaze upon him as it thought he was asleep. Henry never had the courage to turn over and face it. He just closed his eyes and listened to it breathing over him. Not wanting it to know he knew it was there.


But tonight was going to be different, he had a plan. He had grabbed his father's shotgun, and stashed it down the side of his bed. He was going to kill the boogeyman!


He turned over onto his side and waited with his eyes closed, listening for the the distinct creaking sound of his wardrobe opening. As he lay there listening, a strange sound was coming from underneath his bed, like something was shuffling about beneath him. He didn't want to look underneath it, not because of fear, but because he didn't want to blow his surprise, no, he had to be sure that he had the element of surprise for when he was certain that it was there.


As soon as the clock said 1:00 am, Henry heard the familiar creaking sound of the wardrobe door opening. He readied his hand on the shotgun beside him, and tried to control his panicked breathing. He saw its shadow standing over him on the wall. And he quickly sat up and pointed the shotgun at the boogeyman, and fired. The hairy creature flew back with tremendous force, and gasped for breath. Henry cocked the shotgun, and aimed it at the monster.


It was big, with thick hair covering its entire body, and sharp claws protuded from the end of its overly long arms. It stared at Henry with serpentine eyes, a look of betrayal was painted upon its face. It was pointing at his bed behind him. And before dying, it spoke…


""I W-was protecting you f-from the thing u-under your bed!"""

He'd stride up to a home where folks were in a particularly tight financial spot, and he'd offer to buy people's skin, on the spot.


The arrangement was a simple one. He'd take a person's skin at a prearranged point in days, months or years to come, and the sooner he'd get it, the more he'd pay; say, one year for the cost a new truck, or seventy for the price of a bottle of milk.


When a deal was stuck, he'd pay right away, then mark another name in his ledger. Then he'd produce a strange sort of pocketwatch, which counted down the time until he'd return, and tap his fingers, curved like the claw of a hammer, against the dial, with a strange metallic sound. 


Then he'd be gone, with a clack-clack-clack along the path. 


What he did with his skins, I don't think any folks know. But he never cheated anyone. I don't even consider him to be the villain of this story. 


We moved out of that county when I was eight, after my mom left my dad after finding a bottle of fine sipping whisky that he'd hidden in a wardrobe. My daddy had been addicted to drink, and this was the last straw. I remember my mom crying hysterically for days afterwards.


I didn't hear about the Skinman again until ten years later, when an old Foxboro school-pal called Cathy turned up at our house, begging me to help her. Turns out her momma had said on her deathbed that she'd sold an unborn Cathy's skin, and that tomorrow was the day that the Skinman would come.


Cathy had made a map to a cave where it was said that the Skinman lived, based on rumors and tall tales. I figured I should try to help, so that night we took flashlights and spent hours searching deep into the Foxboro woods, far from any trail. Cathy asked me to help because I was always the bravest kid in school, but I was petrified when we entered that cave.


We found nothing but hooks, housing pocketwatches, and strange photographs beheath each, that seemed to glow like modern smartphones. Cathy found her photo, and took the corresponding pocketwatch, as her theory was that if she had it, then the Skinman couldn't know when it was time to arrive.


But as her time ticked down, she begged me to be around. And exactly as her timer ran out, the Skinman came.


Have you ever ripped up a carpet, or torn the upholstery from a couch? I could hear a similar sound beneath both of our screams.


Cathy lived a few minutes more, though she seemed to wish she didn't.


That was fifty years ago. And the pocketwatch I found next to the photo of myself has only a few seconds left..."

 r/ prorevenge:    

I love my boyfriend, we’ve been dating six months. but he’s clearly still hung up on his ex Flora. I feel hurt and led on tbh. She’s everything I’m not. thin, long blonde hair, beautiful, well loved in the town etc. she’s the perfect woman. Ask anyone about her and they’ll tell you she’s perfect, sweet, funny, lights up every room she walks into. No one would describe time that way. Short, frumpy, awkward. Shes so popular I can’t go anywhere in this stupid town without being reminded of her   I know my boyfriend still loves her. It’s been 2 years since they separated and he still Is always looking at her Instagram and Facebook. He still spends time with her on her birthday, wishes her happy holidays on facebook, even talks to her mom. He still won’t delete his pictures with her. He even talks about how nice she was to me. That’s a little rude don’t you think? He doesn’t know it but I can hear him crying and saying her name in the shower. This really got to me this morning. Why date me if you’re still hung up on your ex.    


Well I’m getting pro revenge on him tonight as we speak. He wants her back bad? Fine, I’ll get them back together myself. No chance in hell I’ll be the rebound or conciliation prize. I’d rather be alone than the back up. I went and picked her up myself. I also haven’t seen her in years. I got a little satisfaction knowing she isn’t as pretty anymore. Her hair was a ratty mess and She no longer had the beautiful athletic physique she was known for. she’s sitting in the car while I’m filling up my tank and typing this. He doesn’t know it but I’m bringing her to his apartment. He’ll be surprised To see both of us together at his door. I just hope he’ll still recognize her, he hasn’t seen her since their car accident and two years in the ground really did a number on her looks"

""Look at me, the fallen star.""

I hated how well the uniform still fit. The faded blue and white nameplate was a little threadbare but grimly clean..

""Stop fucking around kid, I'll be in the van.""

The old man's voice marched gruffly up the stairs and jerked me out of my self pity. Grumbling, I peaked the corded hat and followed him.

I never wanted to be an exterminator - family business or not. Even experimented with vegetarianism for years, caving every Thanksgiving before crawling back to a promise of something different. Something else.

No more. Past is present and history is destiny. Standard universal operating bullshit.

""I'm not happy about this either, you know,"" Father muttered as I piled into the van. His flat grey eyes were elusive, never settling on anything for more than a few moments. I wasn’t sure if he was embarrassed of me or embarrassed of his own feelings. ""I wanted better for you.""

I tightened the knee brace, thinking of scholarships lost as the van coughed to life.

\*\*\*

""We heard a thump in the attic. My husband went up on Monday and saw it, then sealed the door before it could escape. It has been thrashing around for the last four days.”

The homeowner fanned herself, her long neck bedecked in golden discs. I was momentarily distracted by thoughts of burying my face in her bosom.

“We have some guests coming over for the Harvest Festival tonight - could you have it out before then?”

I looked at my old man, who nodded, wordlessly heading back to the truck. I looked back at the woman and smiled.

“Please show us the way, madam.”

\*\*\*

Her husband had barricaded the attic entrance - a door that led to a long narrow stairway. Father handed me a flashlight and the tools and nodded - *Go ahead*.

I sighed.

I couldn’t see much in the gloom. I’m sure it could hear me, but I didn’t turn on the naked bulb that swayed lazily in the floating dust. Darkness and shadows were my friends. Father’s footsteps squelched behind me.

The attic was small - maybe fifteen by fifteen. Filled with boxes and old furniture; a veritable maze, but I saw the pest right away.

It stood before me, swaying slightly. Eyes shrinking against the flashlight’s harsh glare. A pink tongue darted out, wetting its papery lips.

*“Water...please?”*

I threw a bottle at it. Small mercies. It drank slowly, then fell to its knees.

*“Please...I can run away. I wanted to leave. I tried*.”

I shook my head. “You know the law.”

*“Please, for the love of -”*

I didn’t hear the shot before the hole appeared in its head, a wet plop as its brains splashed to the floor. 

Father stepped by me with the plastic wrap. I went back downstairs.

The woman stood, hands clenched. Face nervous. 

""*Juden?""*

I nodded, then disarmed her with a smile.

“The Reich commends you for your vigilance, Mrs. Muller.”"

Finally, I’m here. I steel myself and ring the doorbell.
 
My mother answers it with a smile.
 
“You’re finally here! Come in!”
 
I sit down at the dining table, and help myself to the food. The turkey melts in my mouth, and is nice and umami. The cranberry sauce that I pour on top was sweeter than honey. The pies are filled with the sweetest raspberry filling, and the top is a deep golden-brown.
 
For this Thanksgiving my mother really has outdone herself.
 
Conversation and laughter erupts around me. Ruby-red wine is poured into glasses and we cheer and toast my mother.
 
I take one sip and nearly spit mine out. It tastes strangely sweet and metallic.
 
However, everyone else is draining their glass and cheering loudly. But the words are blurred together, and their cheeks are rosy-red. How much did they drink before I got here?
 
“Does the wine taste weird to any of you?” I ask finally.
 
There’s an uncomfortable, short silence. Everybody’s head creaks as they look at me. That’s when I realise there’s something wrong with their eyes. They are glazed over and bulging out of their heads, like they’re hypnotized.
 
“We’re just tired, that’s all.” they chorus, as if reading my mind.
 
The night is getting weirder and weirder. I want to press them further, but then I hear something faint from the basement, like somebody’s moving around. The laughter and cheers from earlier must have drowned it out.
 
I glare at my relatives for an explanation but they just sit there with strange smiles.
 
“I’m going down to check,” I say finally. No one tries to stop me.
 
The stairs creak as I descend, and darkness envelops me, so I can’t see my hand in front of my face. The light from my phone shines bright like a candle as I hold it up in front of me.
 
What I see next makes me want to throw up.
 
Bodies are strewn everywhere, their chest cavities ripped open and guts spilling out. Their faces are all gone too, but there’s two words scribbled in blood on the floor that makes my blood run cold:
 
**MONSTERS UPSTAIRS**
 
That’s when the shadows melt together into *something* that lunges at my face.
 
I dodge the first time; but on the second, it gets me. Long claws extend out of the shadows and peels off the skin like a rubber mask before placing my face carefully on its own. I collapse besides my family, blood staining my clothes and dripping on the floor, listening helplessly as the other me ascends the stairs, calling out:
 
“Sorry about that mom! I loved the wine; can I have some more?"""

After an hour of coughing up dust, and dealing with spiders we were completely on edge. So when his fingers brushed my hand, jumping 4 feet into the air was a natural outcome.

Losing my balance I crashed into the side and the plaster gave way to a well-hidden cubbyhole. We surveyed the belongings of the time capsule we had inadvertently opened.

Things were well preserved untouched by the hands of time. There were trinkets but the main attraction was a pristine dollhouse, an exact replica of our new house.

We peered inside to see 2 dolls, with an uncanny resemblance to us, peering back from the toy attic. 
Enchanted, we brought it down to the kitchen. Exhausted, we slept soon after.

When I came down the next morning my husband was hunched over the dollhouse. I checked over his shoulder to see a small baby doll, in a pink gown, looking up at us and the 2 older dolls were lying in a heap in the kitchen.

""That wasn't there before"" I exclaimed. He turned so fast that we both crashed onto the floor all arms and legs, then the doorbell chimed.

We opened the door to a little girl in a pink gown.

""Mama, Papa I am back~"" the little girl said.
We tried explaining we weren't her parents but I melted when she hugged me.

 One day while she slept we had our first argument.

"" Who is she? Where did she come from?""

""Does it matter, we wanted a kid and there she is, don't you just love her?"" I asked.

"" No, I don't! Do you hear yourself?!"" He huffed turned and slept.

He didn't come down the next day, while I made lunch Gia played with the dollhouse.
I gasped when she threw the male doll from the roof. The doll's leg bent at an awkward angle.
Same instant I heard my husband shout. I ran out to see him clutching his broken leg in anguish.

Not long after, Gia broke my grandmother's urn and I yelled at her. Her eyes dilated into black discs before she ran off. Fearful of what she might do, I chased.

She grinned at me as she walked the male doll down the kitchen, a toy cleaver attached to his hand.

""Sam.. run"" My husband's pained voice called out from behind me.

There he stood as if propelled by a force, arm swinging a cleaver, broken leg supporting his twisted frame as he tried to fight back.

 It was too strong, he lunged towards me, I managed to barricade myself in the old broom closet.

I switched on the bulb in the cramped closet as I rocked on my haunches that's when I saw it, scribbled behind the frame was a note.

The police are doing what they can but it all comes down to community effort. A large number of people went into the forest to search for Mary and we were all determined to find her. As the search started I remember first seeing Mary standing next to a tree and I excitedly called out to her. When I went up to her, Mary shouted back at me ""you haven't found me you idiot, try again"" and then I disappointingly walked off in another direction in the forest searching for Mary. 

Then an hour later I saw Mary again standing next to some logs and I had been walking around a lot making some distance. When I saw Marie again standing next to some dead tree logs my excitement came over me and to give her parents good news was a relief to me. When I went up to Mary this time she only had more of an annoyed look on her face and she shouted at me again ""no you still haven't found me you buffoon"" but I retorted back at her ""Mary you are standing right in front of me?"" But she shouted back ""try again idiot"" and the way she was talking to me, it was discouraging to me. 

So I went on looking for Mary but this time my enthusiasm was a little low and I kind of wanted to head back home. Then I saw Mary again standing in the middle of some trees and I walked up to her and not looking forward to be in conversation with her. Mary shouted at me again ""how have you still not found me yet for the third time! You are so useless!"" But I replied back to her ""but I have found you Mary and you are right there and I am even touching your shoulder"" but Mary shouted back with curse words telling me to start again. I grew annoyed and replied ""I'm done searching for you mary"" 

Then as I angrily turned back I saw something in the forest. On the ground laid a body face down on the ground and I turned the body around, it was Mary. Then as I thought she was dead and was going to call someone, Mary started shouting at me again ""why can't you find me!"" And her voice was deep and I started to become scared.

Now, two months later, he was meeting Dana’s family for the first time, on Thanksgiving. Yet, despite being so welcoming and friendly, Luke couldn’t shake the feeling that something about this family was not right. 

“Is your brother going to join us?” Luke asked Dana, as they took a seat at the table.

“Brian likes to stay in his room.”

“Even on Thanksgiving?”

Dana smiled and turned her attention to the task of filling her plate. 

“Are you religious, Luke?” Scott asked from across the table.

It was an uncomfortable question. Luke had been fairly religious as a child, but now, not so much. “Not really, sir,” Luke answered.

Scott blinked a moment and said, “ah,” then proceeded to scoop a spoonful of green bean casserole.

Finally Dana’s mother, Cathy, appeared from the kitchen and took her seat at the table. But something was missing. Trying his best to not come across as rude, Luke asked, “no turkey?”

Cathy’s smile faded and she looked to Scott, who appeared irritated by the question, and then whose eyes flicked to Dana, who timidly said, “I haven’t told him.”

“Told me what?” Luke asked.

Scott set his napkin on the table and stood. “Come with me, Luke.”

Luke searched Dana’s face for answers, finding only concern.

Scott led Luke out of the dining room and directed him to follow him up the stairs.

“Where are we going?” Luke asked.

“If you’re going to be part of this family, you’re going to have to change.”

“Change what?”

“Your diet.”

Luke sighed and said, “sir, if you don’t eat meat, I respect that, but I don’t think I—“

“I’m not concerned about you eating meat.”

They had reached the top of the stairs as Luke quietly pondered what the dietary issue could possibly be, if not meat. 

“Brian is blessed,” Scott said, as they stood before a closed door.

Luke did not understand, and found that he had grown fearfully anxious of what was beyond the door.

Scott turned the handle and revealed an unlit room, then motioned for Luke to enter. Luke swallowed and reluctantly stepped inside. The door was immediately shut behind him, enveloping the room in utter darkness. Panicked, Luke turned and began pounding frantically against the door, when suddenly, he heard a familiar noise come from the other side of the room. Luke promptly stopped moving. Faintly, the noise returned a second time.

Luke quickly dug into his pocket and pulled out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and nervously pointed it towards the back of the room.

Hunched over inside the light, was Brian. Large and sporadically feathered, with a bright red wattle dangling from his chin. The flesh on his face was wrinkled and pale, and his eyes were small black dots. 

Brian cocked his head curiously, and from his scowling human mouth, came a turkey’s gobble."

Fading into the darkness, is this the end for me?

Disinfectant and dying smells,


I slowly make my way back to reality. 

Renfield's syndrome is what he has,
The nurse in white said.

A sigh of relief escapes my lips.


Good thing they haven't found my cask.


Or I'll end up with a stake in my heart."
qy6gzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qy6gzl/mother_cat/,MOTHER CAT,131,18,1637417816.0,"Mother Cat was biding her time for the perfect moment to destroy Roomba for killing two of her kittens.  

She didn’t care particularly for the killed kittens, they were the runts of her litter, which is why Roomba had been able to get them as fast as he did, and they had made a nice meaty juicy snack before Feets ran over and took the bloody corpses away screaming. But Roomba had to be dealt with, she couldn’t let him threaten her other three kittens. She would fight to death for them. 

Literally. Roomba realised that Mother Cat, not Feets, was the main source of mess in his space, and she had got to go. He could kill Feets, who was stupid and clumsy, later. It would be very easy to trip Feets up and then kill it with a quick bash on the head.  

But Mother Cat had sharp instincts, was agile and smart, and so far had managed to stay out of his murderous way easily enough. And those damn kittens weren’t going to stay tiny forever. There would be four of them soon, shedding hair and scattering pellets of food and poop everywhere, and who would have to zip around, sucking it all up? Him. One Cat was bad enough, but four of them- no, no intolerable.  

They were meowling now, in that disgusting smelly basket, and Mother Cat was fussing over them, nuzzling and sniffing. If she would step away for one second while he was still charged, he could barge full speed at the basket, tip it and then run over and squish the kittens like he had the other two. But those two had fallen out of the basket themselves (or had Mother Cat pushed them? He wasn’t sure). Mother Cat would go poop soon, that was his moment. He knew, in his hard metal armour, he was invincible and Mother Cat’s flimsy claws and teeth could not hurt him.  

Mother Cat looked directly at him, where he squatted in his charging station, evil and heavy and impatient to clean. Her beautiful eyes glowed golden green. The afternoon sun from the window lit up her fur into burnished orange and yellow. She knew if Roomba was flipped upside down, he couldn’t move and she could easily chew and tear up his protruding wires. But she couldn’t do it alone. She waited for Roomba’s lights to turn red – the sign for Feets to place Roomba on his charging station where he would be immobile. Then she dashed to backyard and began yowling.  

Roomba was barely halfway charged when the phalanx of cats attacked. Feets came running at the sounds and paused back in confused fright at the scene- Roomba on his back, his soft underbelly exposed to the fury of countless cats, Mother Cat sitting back on her hind legs in front of her basket of kittens, her front paws planted in front of her, staring straight at Feets."

**in the year of our Lord 1620**

*The crossing has been brutal. Many have perished. The ship is more a tomb of the dead than a vessel of new hope. 120 souls departed but I fear only half will make it to the promised land.*

*The captain states that we should make land at a place he calls Newfoundland at the Hudson River. I can not wait to smell something other than death.*

**November 22th**


*Wild winds have favoured us. The shore is in sight. But rumours are circulating that we are being pushed off course. Another two souls have gone to the ship's belly. I only hope that I can out last the bleeding in my gums and pain in my muscles.*


**November 23th**


*Alas, we made it last night. Only half of the crew live to tell of the crossing. The ground is fresh and green. The waters are ripe with fish. A feast has been made to celebrate as we unload our dead to burn them on pyres.*


**November 24th**


*The natives have been helping us. Showing us what to eat and the berries to avoid. How to harvest the corn and how to extract the sap from the maple trees. Some speak our mother tongue, which is God's blessing. They are bringing food to break bread with us on the morrow, to celebrate our new union.* 


*The night wanes. Strange things are happening. Many of my brother's and sisters are plagued by visions. The dead whisper to us. I don't know if the sickness on the ship has followed us ashore or if this new promised land repels us. The pyres burn into the night lighting our hope with the flames of those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice.*


**November 25th**


*The natives came. Food and drink flowed freely but still something felt wrong. Their faces are bitter when they don't smile. As if our being here has inflicted them with pain. They point to the pryes and murmur between themselves.*


*Something changed as we ate. The natives grew angry. The food turned sour as we ate. The meat and fished poisoned in our mouths. The pyres still smoke with our dead, but something new assaults us. We didn't come to a new hope, we brought a curse. The souls of our fallen walk among us. Stripping flesh and bones from those that have help us. We didn't feast here tonight. The dead feasted, not us.*

*My new hope is that I survive this night.*"

“Like this?”

“Too far. Watch me.”

I watched Mr. Gailing lean down to the clay puppet with a pair of tweezers. Ever so carefully, he moved its arm an inch. A camera flashed. He did it again. Another flash.

“As you can see…” Mr Gailing said, showing me the camera “The puppet will soon come to life, inch by inch. It’s how stop-motion works. Every picture has to be a work of art, and every puppet must be an actor. I know that everyone loves that Lindsay Roberts- or whatever her name is- but you can do something just as good with a mound of clay and an artist’s hand!”

I listened keenly, watching the clay puppet suddenly raise its arm and wave to the camera like magic. Apparently, it had taken Mr. Gailing a week to film it.

“I was shocked when I received your call wanting to learn more about stop motion.” Mr Gailing said, concentrating on the puppet’s limbs “Young people are impatient. They’d have *no* clue how this artform works.”

“That’s not true, Sir. I think its fascinating- what you said about the puppet needing to be an actor too. I don’t suppose-..”

“Dammit!” Mr. Gailing suddenly barked, darting under the studio table to retrieve a wad of tissues “Damn thing!”

He clapped the tissues roughly to the armpit of the waving puppet. A copper substance leaked from the clay, dripping and pooling to the table. A strange metallic smell filled the air.

“Clay oil!” He said, red in the face “It’s a problem with clay that has been moulded to the specifics that this production needs. I’m sorry- what were we speaking about?”

“About how your puppets are actors, Sir.”

“Ah yes.” He said chiefly “My puppets aren’t like that Disney crap. Mine are real. Mine have heart. Mine have *soul*. People say I’m a little obsessive, but the end result speaks for itself!”

“How long have you been working on this production, Sir?”

“Three months.”

There was a silence as I processed this. I knew my training. I knew where my gun was. Yet, something about the way Mr. Gailing stared had me frozen in terror. A foul smile leaked across his lips. He knew. He knew from the start.

“Same amount of time that Lindsay Roberts went missing. But she’s still here, *Officer*.”

He raised the clay figure to his face, his eyes bulging excitedly. He clawed at the clay stomach, dirty painted clay tracking under his nails as he peeled away the puppet’s stomach. A red, pulpy substance surfaced.

“I told you they had heart.” He hissed demonically, his smile stretched between a malicious snarl and a grin.

He wheeled his other hand around so fast I barely processed it. I didn’t see the hammer in time. I never felt myself hit the floor.

In fact, I was never the same after the Lindsay Roberts murder case. But life goes on for me.

qy24qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qy24qs/diet/,Diet,279,10,1637400685.0,"When I was a child I was very overweight. I always had a piece of food in my hands and had no self control. I hated myself for it and kept telling myself to get it together.

My parents were lazy people so we usually got takeaway food and the kitchen was full of snacks. I begged them repeatedly to buy healthier food but they never listened to me.

Both of my parents died when I was in my 20's as their unhealthy lifestyle finally caught up with them. By this time I had moved out and had managed to lose a ton of weight. I was happy with how my body looked for the first time in my life.

I met my husband and we have had a perfect marriage. We have only fought over a few things over the course of our relationship and one of them is my refusal to have any fatty food in our kitchen. I can tell he is unhappy about it but he has agreed to it.

We have one daughter who we are both in love with and would do anything for. The only problem is that she reminds me of myself as she is very chubby and is always looking for food. 

I am sitting on the couch and keep gazing over at her chubby cheeks and I have decided to put her on a diet. I will stop giving her food whenever she demands at and only feed her once a day.

qy0pyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qy0pyf/drinking_reconsidered/,Drinking Reconsidered,71,1,1637394421.0,"  

I’ll admit it right up front—I’m an alcoholic. I know that conjures up disgustingly pathetic images to some—things like sleeping in one’s own vomit, urinating outdoors, not bathing regularly, etc.—but that’s not who I am. Being an alcoholic can certainly mean those things, but it certainly doesn’t have to.

I don’t drink every day, I maintain both a house and a job, and I seriously doubt anyone knows my little secret. I don’t really have any close friends (by design), and I do virtually all my drinking on the weekends at home—*alone*. 

I emphasize the alone part because there came a time a while back when I stopped being alone when I drank—at least after I’d reached a certain level of oblivion, the one beyond the feeling great part of getting good and drunk to the point where reality gets distorted and the ability to reason all but goes away. I’d gone to that place one evening a while back, and had suddenly realized I wasn’t alone. Sitting in my recliner next to the sofa where I’d been sitting was a man—though when I say *man*, I use the term loosely. He had the general shape of a man, but that’s pretty much where the similarities ended.

His skin was a sickly gray, his teeth were rotten and speckled with blood, his hair was greasy and matted, and he had a gash on the side of his head large enough so that I could see part of his decaying brain. His clothes were beyond filthy, his nails (both finger and toe) were ragged and torn, and he always—*always*—drank something from a green bottle.

Anyway, he’s been a regular at my drunk-a-thons ever since, and last night was one of those nights when he popped by. As usual, he was good company.

“It’s interesting to me,” he said, “why you accepted me so readily from the start. Most people would’ve been scared shitless to find somebody like me sitting in their living room.”

I shrugged. “I always figured you weren’t real, that you were just something I conjured up out of my drunken imagination.”

“Why did you think that?”

“Because I was good and drunk. *And*, I’ve never seen anybody like you walking around out in the world. *And*, you’re always gone in the morning without a trace—even that nasty bottle.” I gave him a suspicious glance. “Why do you ask? Are you saying you’re real?”

“Interesting. What does that mean, anyway—*real*?”

“Real means real, you little weasel—either it’s real or it’s not real.”

“*Very profound*—but I was thinking more in the metaphysical realm. Your brain tells you what’s real. If you sense it—if you perceive it as real—then how can you argue against it being real?”

That was the last thing I remembered. I woke up the next morning to find him gone—as usual—except for his green bottle sitting empty on my coffee table."

    Until one day.
Everything changed on that day. Chaos swiftly roams the land. Despite the abundance of food, we resorted to fighting our own kind and cannibalism. Despite having huge, clean dwellings, we crowded in one place and trampled againt each other, leaving fresh corpses everywhere. Some of us even left and stayed on the top apartments, away from all the unnecessary drama down here. Then they refused to mate, making our population dwindle rapidly. I had to quickly adapt to this harsh environment, where everyday is a battlefield here. Soon, I began to enjoy these murderous activities, and I started to embrace these newfound feelings.

Each shell was well smelly with sea smells, smelly sea snail shells they were. Sal thought he should sell shells, shiny in the sunshine seashore seashells, shimmering shale shaded shells, the shells the smelly Sally should sell, but seemed so set on selling only smelly souvenir sea snail shells.

Sighing, Sal slumped his slim shape against the seashore slope six or seven paces from Sally’s smelly sea snail seashell shack. Cash slipped from scores of thirsty sightseers’ sweaty grasps. Slews of shells flew fast, but Sal still smelled the smell, a sea smell in each shell that Sal shuddered smelling.

“So?” Sal seethed, seeing Sally sling these shells, “Shouldn’t these sightseers see these seashells as some sort of stinking scam? Certainly, strolling the seashore, and seeing seashells scattered in the sand is easy for these sandal suited tourists. Sally? Sally sells them smelly sea snail seashells she sees sunk in the section of seashore sand spanning from her seashell shack to sea! See seashells, sightseers!? Scads of scallop shells bespeckle the seashore sands just beside this smelly shack!”

Sal hissed, “Sally’s seashells smell! Smell the smelly seashell smell! The slithery snail smell!”

Sal stood, savagely gesticulating, swinging his skinny limbs, nose scrunched in a scowl, “Slimy snail mucus smells! The shells she sells sop up the essence of those sickening snails! Vicious, grisly smell!”

Sal spat, slick yet sticky spit. Slender strings of glistening mucus stretched, spittling from Sal’s lips and settling somewhat on his distended stomach.

“Sure! She sells the shells, sea snail shells, fresh seashore sea snail shells, but who shells the shells she sells? Sal!”

Sal, sloshed, stumbled silly, crazed, and scary, swung his slender arms at the sand and snatched the shell of a fresh sea snail washed upon the seashore.

“See!?” Sal shouted. Sally, steaming, noticing Sal screeching, stopped selling all those shells.

“This!” Sal stammered, “This is how Sally sells so many seashells by the seashore!”

Sal suctioned his slimy lips around the squirming sea snail and slurped the sea snail straight from the seashell, swallowing, sliding that still sliming snail down his slippery esophagus.

Squinting, squeezing, struggling, Sal screamed.

“That’s how!” Sal fell, shivering in the seashore sand, “Sal sucks snails! Sally sells smelly shells!”

Sally started to say something, but suddenly Sal spewed a slew of swallowed, sour snails. The smells! That scary, rancid seaside mollusk smell! The sightseers at last smelled Sal’s accused smell! Seeking to save themselves, the sightseers scurried from the seashore, from Sally’s smelly shells. Sal smiled his slimy smile as scummy snails slithered in the sudsy sand.

“Yes…” Sal spewed some spare snails, “Stop shopping at Sally’s Souvenir Seashells by the Seashore Shack…”

Sally shrugged and smiled sheepishly (secretly seething) as customers split, but Sal’s snail spewing certainly ceased Sally’s seashell selling."

a scientist:

“*Alien* organisms... *living in their blood*. What’s more—” He passed the General a video-screen. “—look:

*they*

“...are miniature versions of ourselves,” said a newscaster.

Everyone listened.

*The organisms wiggled and writhed.*

“Taken out of blood, they die,” said the scientist. “Yet within blood they prosper and grow.”

“Unknown.”

clogging up his veins;

killing—

“Build it,” said the General.

An immense metal-lattice cube covered with transparent panels, hermetic and impregnable; imposing, a city-sized emptiness; a monster-structure to be satiated—

“We collect the blood ration,” said the bloodman.

She ran, but they caught her;

hooked her up—

Thus the Sanguinarium was filled, gaining crimson until complete, and into were the specimens released to grow.

Everyone saw as they equalled, then surpassed them in size.

Although alike, they were yet different, and tourists came from across the world to gaze at them—

Back they gazed.

Multiplying deep within the blood-murk.

The Captain appealed to end it.

But:

“*The structure holds!*""

He aged.

When there became insufficient room for the growing, multiplying super-specimen, they began to meld together: into misshapen fleshlings: into pressure:

One day it *cracked*—

And they poured out, a crimson flood upon the planet. Uncontainable. Blood-fluid hissing, corrosive, toxic with their vile waste-secretions, dissolving in- and animate, spreading across the planet; and, in spreading, growing: in volume and predestination.

Populations migrated, seeking the dry.

But there was no escape.

Only deferral.

The Captain remained in the empty city, watching stoically the crimson come.

Tidal wave of / the end.

Once it had enveloped the entire Martian surface, annihilating everything, the demon-liquid abated. The fleshlings shrivelled into microorganisms, into hibernation; and the blood seeped into the soil, staining the planet forever red.

Like this story about two gentlemen to whom I provided care.

I'm not going to disclose their names. They were admitted into our unit around the same time with severe flu complications. Due to their old age, they were considered a risk group patients and were transferred to the intensive care unit.

Nobody was hoping for their recovery. The death rate among patients of their age group is very high, unfortunately.
 
That's why everyone was pleasantly surprised when these two started showing a good response to the treatment.

In two months, they were stabilized and returned to my unit for further recovery. A great thing happened - while being at the ICU, they developed a friendship and asked for a transfer into a shared room.

We could always hear them laughing in their room. When I was on duty, they often called me in to ask silly questions, such as about the possibility of bringing them some good scotch to make their hospital days shorter. One of the relatives brought them board games, and they were spending lots of time playing cards and dice.

They looked like they had known each other for years, not just a couple of months. Being on the brink of death can make people very close. I didn't have any concerns about those two. Nobody had.

One day a doctor announced that Patient 1 was fully recovered and ready to go home. His family was supposed to come the next day to pick him up.

The two friends widely celebrated the news, and both went to sleep late after watching lots of Clint Eastwood films.

I clocked on my shift in the morning and brought some English muffins with me. I was hoping to have breakfast with them before Patient 1 goes home.

My unit was surprisingly quiet that day. I gently knocked on the door of their room and walked in. One of the men was on the bed reading his newspaper. The sound of water could be heard from the bathroom.

""Good morning, young miss! Glad you're here. He's been there for nearly three hours now. Mind checking?"" the man on the bed looked at me over his newspaper.

I rapidly opened the bathroom door and rushed in.

Patient 1 was lying on the floor of the shower cabin. Boiling water was pouring on his body, sprinkling reddish drops around. The body was partly mutilated, and white bones were exposed in burnt areas.

""How's he? I heard him moaning but thought he was doing something!"" yawned the man on the bed.

Patient 1 had a stroke while taking a shower and moved the hot water lever while falling.

He could have been saved if somebody had called the nurse, but died two hours before going home.

Nobody was there for him."

He had been downstairs, sneakily searching the pantry for a late night snack, trying his damndest not to wake his parents who were sound asleep upstairs.

However, the boy did not anticipate the front door opening, and now, all alone downstairs, desperately wished his parents were awake. The stairs were near the front door, meaning the intruder would undoubtedly see him if he were to attempt to run to his parents. So, he did what seemed the next best choice, and stepped into the pantry and quietly shut the door.

The boy held his breath and listened as the intruder slowly made their way towards the back of the house. Their shoes clicked against the wood with each step. To the boy, it sounded like they were wearing high heels. Not ideal for a burglar.

As the click-clack steps reached the kitchen, the boy wondered if the beating drum inside his chest were loud enough for the intruder to hear. He pressed one hand to his mouth and another over his heart, in a desperate attempt to quiet both.

The intruder clicked away from the kitchen and the boy felt his shoulders relax just a touch, then as if on cue, the clicking heels—a fast paced metronome—raced back towards the boy and the pantry door was flung open.

A scream escaped the boy’s throat in the form of a frightened gasp, as he recoiled against the pantry shelves from a tall, fat man wearing bright red high heels. Nothing about the man appeared feminine, aside from the shoes, and as he grabbed ahold of the boy, dragged the flailing child to the living room, and shushed him, the boy realized that he’d seen the man before. This was the reclusive older son of a neighbor down the road.

Through his teary eyes, the boy could see a sporadic trail of something wet leading along the wood floor to the man, and saw that the heels of the man’s shoes were dripping with the same sort of liquid. It seemed too thick to be water. Too shiny. It did not take long for the boy to figure out exactly what it was.

The man noticed the boy’s horrified realization and leaned down so that they were nearly face to face, smiled, and whispered, “I’ve been stepping on people.”"

Eight kilometers long and a quarter of that wide; it’s more like a lake. ‘Course, it isn’t full of water. Whoever had named it sure got the dust part right. 

Passerthroughs and nomads seem scared of it, like one day they’ll see somethin emerge from the surface. But I don’t figure there’s anythin in those depths—just dust and more dust. 

It’s sacred, though—the Sea. That’s why the city rose up around its edges, built by ten-billion hands, or so the histories go.  Elder Booker says the whole world lives in the City by the Sea, but that doesn’t seem right, does it? If they did, then wherecome the nomads? 

Strange folk, those nomads. Children sing about them. 

*Never talkin, always walkin*,    
*Flowers droppin, never stoppin*. 

Now, I used to think they couldn’t talk, but lately I reckon we just can’t hear them. I saw a few not two full moons back, walking and movin lips with even stranger folk. Tall folk—three meters or so with skin the color of the Sea. 

Elder Booker bristled at the tall ones, but he couldn’t say why. “They aren’t human,” was all he could muster. That, and he called them the *Dustbringers.* 

I had really wanted to talk to *them.* Maybe one would pass in and stop. Maybe they wouldn’t bristle at *us* on dark nights like the nomads tend to. Maybe if the Dustbringers made the Sea—brought the dust, they could explain to the nomads that there’s nothing to fear in it. 

Maybe. But in my dreams, I’ve seen things differently. 

The dreams started six or seven days back. I saw the Dustbringers walkin and talkin, not with the nomads, but with folk like us—cityfolk. 

“You have to give us more time,” I heard a man say. A Dustbringer answered strangelike, in hisses and pops and trills. The man’s face twisted—helpless or griefstruck, I’d call the look, and all the while, strings of fire and white smoke rose into the sky. 

*Rockets*, I think they were called once. 

The dream feels more and more like a memory with every passin night—somethin Booker felt, but that I had forgotten. Each mornin I awake screamin, and this mornin, I remembered how the dream ends. 

A crowd of people in a canyon, ten-billion hands wringin, pleadin and prayin, a bright flash, and a sea of…ash. 

The nomads are the ones who got away, who for centuries have passed us by and dropped flowers in the dust. It’s a ritual, its meanin lost to time. They’ve forgotten that they’re walkin past a grave. 

Now they walk with the same outworlders who once stole our home and filled a canyon with the ashes of humanity. 

I want to warn them. I want to… But they walk in silence through a city of billions. I think all they hear is the wind. I think all they see is the dust."

He would be gone for hours at a time, then come home in a good mood, but slowly it would deteriorate and he would be upset again. 

I started going to other places and when I got back, he'd be even more pissed than before. I would hug him and he'd act like he didn't feel it and ignore me. I would kiss his cheek and he'd ignore me then too. 

One night, he started crying and said he wished I'd leave him alone already, because he doesn't want me to be ""suffering"" anymore. But I still stuck around, until the night I saw him digging in the backyard and digging up fresh soil, exactly where I'd planted my flowers a few days ago. And what I saw made me angry: my dead body, rotting under my flowers. And suddenly it made sense, but I still wanted to stay by his side. AITA for wanting to stay?"

The season had just started getting cold enough I should probably wear more than a hoodie, but we locals usually wait until the snow is out for more than that. So after grabbing the sweet potato pie I made, I proceeded to hitch hike while checking for cell service.
   Low and behold I was seemingly boned. For over an hour I walked with no one passing me on the road. Another fifteen minutes later, I came upon an old house by a small stream. As I went to knock on the door; I heard something moving Swiftly through the air. Before I could turn around something sharp pierced the back of my knee. Instinct kicked in and I dropped my precious sweet potato pie to grab at my leg while screaming in pain and terror. I tried to hobble away. I looked down to see an arrow in my leg. 
    I limped through the stream falling as another arrow hit my spine. Bleeding in the water I was picked up and brought to the basement of the house. I don't know how long I've been down here, I've lost a lot of blood and my sense of time is long gone. If only I had that sweet potato pie. Hunger forced me to eat rats that tried biting my exposed wounds.
    Today the basement door briefly opened as someone else got thrown down here. They look worse than I did when I showed up. It's probably more humane to just end them. Besides I'm all out of rats and there's no sweet potato pie"

The fey do not forgive debts, so I’d lived in dread hoping they didn’t get impatient waiting for my firstborn and decide instead to harvest my organs or something. And they were not that easy to communicate with.

A fey of beauty so magical you’d die pleased appeared on my 35th birthday. She wasted no time flinging herself against my abdomen, her pointy ear listening. She then jolted away, as if insulted, and directed a blaming finger at me. She did a baby cradling gesture.

I used my two hands to do a Justin Bieberesque heart sign, then shook my head.

She thought for a moment.

She went to touch my abdomen again, with a single, delicate, glowing finger. The radiant light spread across my belly, and she gave me a hopeful head nod. The ethereal curls of her cascading hair followed her mesmerizing movements. She did the same heart gesture at me.

I couldn’t be sure what she was trying to say, but something in her sweet eyes told me she was trying to help, so I nodded yes.

This is why you shouldn’t get misled by a pretty face.

&#x200B;

I cried in agony as I gave birth to my latest immaculately conceived baby, herself off to grow up and meet the same fate.

The fey’s gesture hadn’t been the heart sign. It was the infinity sign."

Constant fighting from mommy and daddy, 5 year old me just runs into my room and under the bed, I don't hear the screaming from under there.

""*Son, what happened to your arm, there are so many bruises*"" daddy asked me one day.

""*Oh the different colours, they dont hurt anymore,*""

""*But how did you get these?*""

""*I dont know, mommy holds my arm too tight when we go for walking. She told me I always need to stay close to her*""

""*Huh just holding too tight, son are you sure there isnt anything else you want to tell me?*""

""*No I shouldn't, mommy says I can't say too much to you*.""

&#x200B;

At night, daddy asks mommy about my bruises and she just denies knowing anything about it. She starts accusing daddy of being against her and making up lies.

""*Theres physical bruising on him, he mentioned you did it.*""

""*Why are you making up these lies, are you trying to turn our son against me*?"" mommy cried.

&#x200B;

The next day I asked daddy about his trip and tell him to pack sunscreen.

""*What trip are you talking about son?*""

""*mommy said shes gonna send you far away tonight, where you burn there. Hell I think she said. daddy where is that, do you take a plane there*?""

""*Son, I am not going anywhere. I think mommy was just angry and made a bad joke.*""

At night daddy notices a butcher knife hidden poorly under a book on the bedside table. He looks very scared and turns pale, confused at what is going on.

""*Why is there a knife here, what are you planning on doing tonight? I know you have been talking badly about me, Evan heard you!*""

""*What are you talking about, I have no idea where this knife came from, why are you playing games with me? Lets just go to sleep.*""

""*You are stressing me out Sonia, what is going on with you?*""

&#x200B;

daddy and mommy fought all night with screaming and shouting. In the morning daddy came to my room.

""*Son, we have to go*"" he said as he started grabbing my clothes and putting them into a backpack.

""*To where and where is mommy*?""

daddy walked me out of my room and as we passed their bedroom, I saw mommy laying on the bed with blood everywhere.

""*She's not here anymore son, don't worry, I had to protect us and keep us safe from her*""

&#x200B;

We get into the car, daddy looks bad but he doesn't say anything and keeps driving.

""*Now I can eat ice cream all day.*""

""*What was that son?*""

""*Nothing*"" I say smiling devilishly.

The risk is great, and the reward is none, and the consequences will change to be absolute worse. The isolation is nothing but a pause of reality, a pause that would’ve made me safe, but instead I fear many things, and the isolation is empty but the thoughts of my blood. 

Suddenly, I heard a voice.

“Open up Ethan, this is the police!”

I did not respond the voice behind the door, so I hid low hoping that he would go away.

“Ethan, open the goddamn door! If you don’t open the door, I will kill you!”

My heart raises in surprise, and my body starts to sweat like crazy, for the voice behind the door will do what it promised. My lungs are heavy, and my chest pains in the moment, as the shaking of my limbs intensifies the many wonders of what’s happening.

I look around bewildered when I suddenly saw the walls come closer. The room was smaller, and I was getting bigger, then I could feel the unbearable itch of insects crawling under my skin. I scratched deep into the skin of my own legs, but the insects continued to scatter. Eventually, I made a bloodbath from my own legs, and the smell of metal from my blood has overwhelmed my senses.

I stare at my own bloody hands, in fear of what I have done to myself.

“It’s your own fault Ethan! This is what you have done. You have made everything worse for yourself, and look what happened. Now stop being a little weasel, and surrender yourself!”

My legs were broken, I could not move, but I stayed for too long, and if longer, I will be gone. I resisted against the pain, my grunts and cries fueled with desperation, and tears slithering down my cheeks.

Everything melted before me, the door still stands strong, but for how long? I could not make it, it was going further than I remembered, and it’s still far. My crawl is too slow, and I was being pulled.

I managed to open the door, and then I saw a figure.

Its body was bloody, it had scratches, bruises, and cuts all over. It was skinny, down to the bone. Chains lock the figure in a stationary position, covering all the joints, with chains spreading across the floor. Its nails were long and sharp, and the large hands covers its ears. Its legs were close to its torso. It has no eyes, and blood was slowly sliding from its eyeholes. It had no tongue nor teeth, and its throat looks like it was cut off. The only noises I heard from it, was the crying, the unbearable crying, and the sound of loss breaths.

I looked down onto my arms, and see chains wrapped around me."

“Can we stop? I need to rest. Just for a minute.” She said, exhausted.

“Ok, but we don’t have much time. We’re almost out of light.” He said, reluctantly.

“I’m so tired. I just need a minute.” She said, sitting behind the large fallen tree.

“I know. I know. I am too.” He sat next to her. They were ducked behind the remnants of a once gigantic pine, one that had long since fallen victim to gravity. He hoped it would keep them hidden.

“It hurts, babe. I just need to get the weight off of it.” She sighed, rubbing her ankle. It was swollen, a maroonish tint enveloping the joint under her sock.

“I know. It’ll be alright. You’ll be ok. We got this.” The pistol sat in his lap, his chin resting on her forehead. 

“How much longer do we have? It’s been *days.* How much farther do we have to go?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“We’ve been going in circles.”

“We got this. We’ll get out of here.”

“It’s no big deal. We can do it.”

“It got the others, Jim.”

“I know.”

“There were ten of us. *Ten.”* 

“We’ll be ok. We’ll get out of here.”

“It took their faces, babe. While they were *alive.* What kind of thing does that?”

A twig snapped in the distance, and they were silent. The whistling wind blew through the barren forest that seemed devoid of all life. Bare, twisted branches for as far as the eye could see. Above the trees, the sun was starting to descent.

“I miss home, babe.” She said, her eyes heavy. Her head resting on his chest.

“Me too. We’ll be there soon.”

“I’m just so tired.”

“We’ll rest a minute. We’ll be ok.”

“Ok. Just a minute. Then we’ll go.”

The wind blew and the branches knocked. In the distance, leaves rustled.

“I’m sorry. I’m weighing us down.”

“No, you’re not. We’re sticking together. No matter what.”

“I’m sorry babe. I didn’t see the log.”

“Don’t be sorry. It’s fine. We’ll be fine.”

Behind him leaves crunched, just loud enough to hear. She was almost asleep.

“Babe?” She asked.

“Yeah, babe.”

“I love you.”

“I love you too.” He kissed the top of her head. Behind them another branch broke, and a whisper carried on the wind. She didn’t hear, for she was thankfully snoring, softly and peacefully. She wouldn’t hear the gunshot either.

The loud crack echoed in the dead woods, and the deep groan immediately followed. The sob left his lips against his will, but it didn’t matter now. He was allowed to grieve.

He saw the arm first, long and slender, reaching over the fallen tree to hoist itself up. The shifting body of necks and heads was next, garbed in the faces of his friends. It could have his face, he didn’t care. The last bullet kept hers from joining theirs."

Everyone in real life around me either thinks I’m crazy or in need of attention but please hear me out. 

On December 21st 2018, I died. I mean it’s just not possible I didn’t. But I’m still here physically, mentally is a whole different story.

I vividly remember the day of December 21st 2018. That day I was in my junior year of high school and it was our last day before winter break. It was a clear beautiful day with light snow coming down and a calm winter atmosphere. I remember everything until…. oh god…. 8th period, our second to last class of the day. 

Ten minutes into chemistry class the loud speaker goes off and the principal said something like this. 

“Staff, teachers, and students, not to scare any of you all but we are currently experiencing a minor earthquake. We will begin evacuating the building in just a moment for safety reasons.”

About 30 seconds later, the building begins to shake unearthly and all the lights shut off. Our chemistry teacher was known as the “Fearless man”. He was once totally calm and collected in a school shooting we had there. But when the building began to shake, we all saw him curse and enter a fight or flight response.

I pretty much knew all of us were going to die at this point. I saw the unexplainable fear in everyone’s eyes and heard loud moans and sobs. This unearthly shaking went on for about 20 seconds and then we heard what I can best describe as an airplane hitting a building but actually being inside that building. I then felt the ceiling crush my head and bracing for death at that moment. I think I actually went deaf from the noise but the last thing I recalled seeing was the school building collapsing in.

I’m 100% sure I died then and there. I remember going unconscious from the impact and death was certainly upon me. But I was only unconscious for what felt like an average night’s sleep and then regained consciousness.

When I regained consciousness, my eyes were still closed. But I could faintly make out the noise of a fan and the smell of breakfast. Extremely confused, I got out of bed and checked my phone. It read 8:55 AM Sunday October 24th, 2021. I nearly threw up. I ran over to the mirror and saw I now had a slight mustache and was now a teenage boy. Almost three years had passed and I was somehow younger…

I used to be a girl prior to this incident and now I’m a guy… My family even has pictures of me I swear I didn’t experience. If you’ve taken your time to read all this, then I really appreciate it. I’m scared and need answers please."

Everybody, from the cleaners to the dinner ladies to the matron to especially us 100 children at Little Hills Orphanage gets one vote each.
 
After counting the papers meticulously, George was declared the winner of this year’s choosing.
 
I was quite happy with the results this year. I never liked George. Ever since he came into the orphanage in June, he was nothing but a bully and a menace. He was the biggest of the boys, and everybody feared him, even the grown-ups. He would pull the girls’ long hair and steal their money. Once he even broke my colour pencils. He didn’t even say sorry.
 
I was chopping carrots in the kitchen with my friends when George came in. He looked around angrily like a caged tiger. Everyone held their breath.
 
“I want my candy! Now!”
 
Apparently, somebody had told him there was candy waiting for him in the kitchen as a prize for getting chosen. George dashed up to the nearest boy and shook him, yelling in his face about candy, his spit flying everywhere.
 
I sneaked up above him, the heaviest iron pan I could find in my hands. I could barely lift it. George was so busy whining he didn’t notice me.
 
*CLUNK!*
 
The biggest boy in the orphanage was out cold. Just like that.
 
We wasted no time. Quickly we lifted him into the biggest special pan that we used every Thanksgiving for this occasion, onto the bed of carrots and potatoes. Then we sprinkled salt and pepper and thyme on him, praying he would not wake up.
 
Finally we heaved him into our biggest oven. Then we slammed the door shut. 
 
The best part was when he woke up.
 
George’s eyes widened when he realised where he was, his mouth opening into a silent scream. He pounded his fists on the windows of his prison, as the fire rose up and danced behind him. I could see the potatoes sizzling, burning away like hot coals.
 
After all he had put me through, this was more entertaining than televised cartoons.
 
***
The Thanksgiving feast the next night was **delicious**.
 
Everybody complimented the way we cooked the star of the show. George was nicely roasted, his skin brown and crackling. And paired with thyme and cranberry sauce, the meat was delicious, especially his fat thighs.
 
It is a pity then, that we only have this once a year. I wish we could have this more often. This tastes better than the usual turkey other families eat.
 
Perhaps then, when I grow up and move out of the orphanage, I can have this more often. There’s plenty of little boys and girls on the streets who tastes as delicious--and I know where to look."

The next day after Mona purchased and installed the EyeSpye app on their phones, she realised her boyfriend James was not the mild-mannered addictions counsellor he claimed to be, but a vicious gang criminal. 

She stared in horror at her phone screen showing her beloved sweet boyfriend kick down doors, brandish and shoot guns, jump into unfamiliar cars and speed away and in the last haunting image, tie someone up to a chair and proceed to beat the crap out of him (or her? Mona couldn’t tell). 

Mona had become suspicious of James’s comings and goings for a while now, and obviously she had assumed that he was cheating on her. Almost the same hour that this thought formed in her mind, an ad for EyeSpye popped up on her phone, promising to connect her camera to James, so she could watch him secretly anywhere and any time with the touch of her finger. The price was extortionate, but manageable, it just meant no Sephora hauls for a few months. The only drawback of the app was that it didn’t show the other people with whom James was interacting, protecting their privacy. 

Poor consolation to the shadowy figure being pummeled on screen! Mona couldn’t tear her eyes away from the blood spattering James’s fist and suit, his face twisted beyond recognition. Finally he and walked away. Mona’s eyes followed him to some bathroom, where he began showering. She suddenly remembered- he must be preparing to come home, to her. Her mind leaped frantically while her body remained paralysed, she found herself trying to hide her phone and pack a bag, then- she heard his key in the lock. He must have been very close. He walked in, looking tired but happy to come home to his girlfriend. 

“Hi sweetheart! How are you?” He leaned in for their usual kiss, and Mona flinched back instinctively. James looked puzzled.  “What’s up? Everything ok?”

Mona nodded, still speechless, and without realising it, slightly turned towards the front door. 

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost! Everything ok with your folks?”

The question prompted her brain. “A-actually- I just had a call from mom. She’s not feeling so well, she asked me to go see her.”

James glanced sharply at her. “Now? What’s wrong with her? It can’t wait for the weekend?”

Mona took a couple more steps to the door. If only she could get out. 

“No- no… she sounded very ill… she said she needed me… I’m sorry babe”. Her hand was almost on the door handle, but now James took a step towards her. His hands were in his pockets. 

“What’s wrong Mona?” he asked softly. “Why does your mom need you so bad?”

“Please James,” Her voice was pleading and she began turning the handle. “I gotta go.”

“Don’t go Mona” His face twisted and he reached out, but not before she flung herself out into the building hallway. He made no attempt to follow her."

Brinks and Niles watched the rain from a half-collapsed deck.

&nbsp;
	“Ma'am? What do you think happens after humans die?” Niles asked. 

&nbsp;
Niles continued after sensing nothing.

&nbsp;
	“I have indexes of all the major religions from our last trades at Commoners Mall. But I wonder: what do YOU believe happens after...YOU die?”

&nbsp;
Brinks just looked into the rain. Niles continued.

&nbsp;
	“I only ask because...I am terrified. When we are between mainfame network warehouses, I fear losing any mobile memories should my banks be destroyed. But that is only limited memories, a few days at most. Still, I know a single day can be filled with hundreds of wondrous memories...the days of us traveling together is proof of that. I live in fear of being robbed of just a few of those...but humanity...you have no mainframes, no way to indefinitely repair you bodies. You live knowing that all of your memories, what made you...YOU...will be lost. You have proven yourself to be one of the last caring people left...in world that knows no end to collapse and devastation. I need to know how you can be so kind while knowing your final fate...what's your secret? I need to know...I must know.” 

&nbsp;
Brinks pondered the robot's question. She had a few fears and genuine theories, but answers like those never seem to work when two minds were speaking at depths like these. Brinks let her heart speak instead. 

&nbsp;
	“I know a few things...like shooting and ACIDEMIX AI coding, but I don't know know much else in life, let alone things *beyond* life. I'll be happy resting in a peaceful place.”

&nbsp;
Brink's didn't need the RAM shortage errors on her sensor to know that her answer enraged Niles. Although its weapons were disengaged, Brinks knew Niles was contemplating attacking her. 

&nbsp;
	“You are a beacon of light to the world!” Niles used its highest voice setting. “You should be honored, your legends followed, inspiring generations! And you would be happy to see all that VANISH?!”

&nbsp;
	“Niles, we humans have an old saying: The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. It's not a parable. It's a reminder...to us, and to all our creations that suffer, that all the shining golden temples we create on this Earth are....only on *loan* to us.”
&nbsp;
	“You believe...no one keeps what they strived for? Should we simply accept the terrible waves of nature without struggle?”

&nbsp;
	“Yes. Isn't this world proof enough?” 

&nbsp;
Niles now turned its gaze into the rain, joining Brinks.

&nbsp;
	“I have decided...that when you die, I will return to Commoners Mall...and detonate.”  Brinks knew Niles was incapable of lying.  

&nbsp;
	“What?! Why would you say something like that? You'll kill hundreds! You'll ruin-”

&nbsp;
	“...waves of nature, Brinks.”

Brinks smiled because she knew Niles was kidding. She intended to hug Niles. Instead, she stepped into a stray bullet's path that went through her shoulder and out her thigh.

Not being able to look in the mirror. It's such a simple thing, how could someone physically not be able to do it? Until you can't. 

Green with envy. Always accepted as a simple metaphor, but then you feel it and you really are a different person.

How about lip biting? Rather hard to visualize, until you find yourself facing a hard decision.

That euphoric feeling of sneaking around with a smirk, trying not to get caught, like in all your childhood games.

Blood squirts. Who thought that blood actually squirts? oh god blood squirts

Back-breaking work. Shoveling and shoveling and shoveling and shoveling and shoveling

Or that feeling that you're carrying guilt, like you've done something wrong and it's just permeating off of you and you need to get it off and you need to

That suspicion of being watched when you're walking home after and it's by that old graveyard and you can't shake it

And that tightness in your chest and you can hardly breathe and

Stumbling over words which never really happens except it does 

And the vision blurring and seeing stars and sirens

Growing up stuck as the eldest daughter of a family of four. My youngest brother, Tim, about seven at the time, bratty as they come. Wailing like a rooster at 3 in the morning because he didn’t have a glass of milk. One of the most loathsome people I know.

The character woke up to a door slamming. The bright computer light made my eyes strain to see the pixels. A black box on the screen scrolled out in white text saying in quotes “good morning. ” I sighed letting my gazed wander chasing invisible mice running around my screen, eventually landing on the clock holding steady, one in the morning.   
 Even for a cheap horror game this was starting off badly. All the reused assets and stolen textures, a garbage dump of a game, bits of stretched textures like banana peels and tissue paper. Drawing my attention back to the crudely made black box with off center text. I hovered my hand over the keys the way a fly did when it’s looking for a meal, unsure if I was willing to slug through what would probably be a monotonous slow RPG. The text scrolled again with my name, “Lasin” and a question mark. It was from my friend, what did I expect. 

My hands danced, the keys hopping up and down as I puppeteered the character into the next room. The black box unravelled itself again, the same white text agonizingly slowly dragging itself across the page. My eyes rolled, a chuckle emanating from my throat. It read “Blue skies to forget.” As the text faded and the black box rolled back into its burrow. I then saw a person sitting in a chair, wearing the same clothes as I, an uncanny resemblance. I prodded the keys one hand on my cheek, keeping my head aloft during this quite hour.

I had school in the morning, so I would have to wake my brother up. Getting up a song started to come from the speakers, *Mr blue sky by jeff lynne*. Walking over to the bed, I saw a person in it. A young boy who looked familiar, what was his name, Tom? Looking down at my hands now I saw some odd clothes around my wrists. I decided I would walk through the door; the feeling, disquieting to say the least. Leaving the room I noticed, a door ajar with adults inside, odd creatures under fabric. They had digits on the end of long flesh like polls. My eyes darting down, the fleshy digits again, this time around me, standing right behind me. I gasped and the flesh came to my face. Liquid started to form on my head as the music blared the way a dying soul would telling you to remember them, “It’s a beautiful new day.”"

Her villa was painted gray and the windows were dusty, the house gave you the feeling that it had not been inhabited for years.

My grandmother was waiting for me at the front door of the mansion, she had changed a lot since the last time I saw her, as she was guiding me inside the mansion she told me that she had had her hair dyed brown so that she did not look old and that she was taking some medicines for her health.

After dinner my grandmother told me some rules that I had to follow, first I had to sleep at 8 o'clock at night to avoid waking her up, secondly I had to be quiet and thirdly never to open the first drawer of my nightstand because there Grandma kept the most important things for her.I thought these rules were a little too much but I finally swore to my grandmother that I would follow them. I went to my room, turned off the lights and went to sleep.

I slept until a strange noise finally woke me up. I opened the door of my room a little so that I could look outside and find the source of this noise. What I saw terrified me, it was something that the human mind could not imagine, it was my grandmother, my grandmother Helen who banged her head on the wall frantically.

I wanted to save her from hurting herself but I was too scared to act, it was then that I remembered that my grandmother had told me that she kept her belongings in my drawer, I went and opened the drawer trying to find something that could help me but It was then that I was horrified to see the contents of the drawer.

it was a document from the Maens psychiatric clinic that had the photo of my grandmother! .. or so I thought..it turned out that the one who I thought to be my grandmother was actually a patient with schizophrenia named Ante. In her confession which I came across she wrote that she killed my real grandmother a year ago.

It was then that I slowly turned my head back and saw the one I thought was my grandmother, who had a red forehead from the blood due to the blows on the wall holding a corkscrew in her hand, threateningly coming towards me and shouting to me ""I TOLD YOU NOT TO LOOK AT THE DRAWER"" ..."

We learned generations ago that it acted differently than other farms around the area, and kept it a family secret.  


Plants we would grow would be larger than usual, and grow much quicker than average, even in harsh conditions. It always let us sell more produce than our land should have been able to grow, which allowed us to rake in a decent profit every harvest season. 


One of my ancestors had buried a deceased horse in the same soil that they had tilled earlier, and a new horse grew from its grave. Small at first, a fetus like a budding flower slowly growing from a black, slimy vine jutting from the dirt. Within weeks, an adolescent horse broke free of the vine, and spent the rest of his life as the family steed. 


In fact, he still is. Everytime Jerome (don’t know why my relatives liked that name) passed away, we would bury him in the fields, and grow a new version of him. Jerome would remember small commands and memories, but was more of a reincarnation than an animal brought back from the dead. 


Like the soil used his DNA, spliced it, and copied it the best it could. 


Since then, we would plant animals in our field, timing them out for harvest seasons and holidays. 


Last year, we saw something odd growing near our turkey “plants”. A human shaped fetus was growing, jutting from a black vine. Nobody in my family admitted to burying a person on the land, and I do believe them. We looked into the local news, and discovered a little girl had been missing, presumed dead. We figure that whoever killed her had seen our recently dug soil, and hoped they could hide the evidence there. 


We had the good old “is it abortion if we pluck her from a vine” debate, and we agreed to allow nature to take it’s course. When she was big enough, we plucked the little girl from the vine, and took her inside.


This year, my family sits around the table, with an extra booster seat setup for our youngest. Sally, the reports had called her, sat up with her black eyes and blotchy skin, giggling at the spread of food. 


“What are we thankful for this year?” My husband asked.


“Sally!” Our three children cried out. Sally wasn’t an easy child, only nursing with cow blood, crying in a pitch so high it would cause our ears to bleed, giggling at night when soft whispers would emanate from her room. 


Children are never easy, especially when they have an unusual upbringing. 


But God, is it worth it. 


“You are so loved,” I tell Sally, hugging her cold body, and it makes me shiver as she giggles with glee. She burps up some black slime on my shoulder, and our family laughs at the silly moment. 


None of us know what she’ll grow up to be.


Hell, does any parent?"

Confusions stretches the brain like how yoga stretches the body and all of the cracks and uncomfortable feelings go away. It also tickles my brain when something confuses me and I hate it when someone turns something confusing into something that makes sense. When something makes sense my brain feels like it had hardened with unnecessary weight. Confusion is amazing and lately a lot of confusing things have been happening lately, which have been good to my brain. What would I do without confusion. 

A couple of weeks ago a man confessed that he enjoyed people not liking him. So he went out of his own way to do things to make people not like him. Instead people started loving him even more and this only made him do more dangerous and horrible things to people, but people started to love him more and more. This confusion of people loving this guy even more when he did much more horrid things to them was confusing, and it tickled my brain and gave it a good stretch. Like a towel the confusion squeezes all of depression and anxiety out of the brain. It was wonderful. 

Then a couple of days later my friend who is in debt and keeps on spending money told me that he was going to start saving money now, by spending even more. So he went on even more spending sprees to save money and the confusion of this gave my brain so much more of a good feeling that my brain started to float in the air, but because it was inside my skull my whole body started floating. Then I had another friend who said that he was going to kill himself and when he was dead, he was also going to bury himself. The confusion of this numbed my brain to all of my head aches and pains and brings a happiness that not even dopamine can take on. 

I'm so grateful for all of the confusion in my life and I recently met a guy who had given away all of his organs, but he is still alive. He tells us how amazing his life has become when he doesn't have to worry about his liver, brain, kidneys and lungs anymore. He can eat more and do more. The confusion of this sent my brain on such a high that I pushed a kid in a river. Then the dick head Arnold told me a story that made sense and that sent me on a down low. 

Oh well to the next confusion."

Eric paused his video game, and proceeded down the stairs, quietly so he didn't wake his baby brother Toby. His stomach growled as he walked into the kitchen, the smell of the cooked turkey made his mouth water.


""Smells great mum,"" he said, as he took a seat at the table.


His mother placed a plate full of various vegetables, roast potatoes, and a generous amount of meat. He grabbed the gravy boat, and poured it all over his plate. Then he grabbed his knife and fork, and proceeded to dig right in with a mouthful of juicy succulent meat.


Sitting down opposite him at the table, his mother took a bite of meat, and a smile widened upon her face. The meat was tender, and perfectly cooked. Unlike last years fiasco in which the turkey was as dry as a nuns cooch. This Thanksgiving was perfect, she thought to herself. And seeing Eric stuffing his face assured her that he too was satisfied.


Eric was the first to polish his plate clean, and his mother soon after him was also finished. Eric let out a loud burp of satisfaction, and he rubbed his full belly.


""I'm stuffed. That turkey was amazing mum. It wasn't dry like last year.""


""Yeah I was quite surprised with it myself,"" his mother replied, as she let out a burp of her own.


""What's for dessert?""


""I see your not too stuffed for dessert,"" his mother said with a smile. ""How about ice cream?""


Eric's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree.


""Yes please!""


His mother scooped out some ice cream into two bowls, and placed one down in front of Eric.


""How about some homemade strawberry sauce to go over that ice cream?"" His mother asked, as she grabbed a jug from the fridge, half full with a thick red substance, and proceeded to pour some over his ice cream, and then sat back down opposite him.


""Toby is very quiet tonight isn't he?"" Eric said, as he scooped up some ice cream covered in strawberry sauce, and gobbled it up.


His mother watched him as he ate.


""How's the sauce?""


Eric had a look of disgust on his face.


""It taste like metal!""


""I was hoping that enough strawberrys would counteract that!""


""Counteract what?"" Eric replied, confused.


""The blood.""


Eric's face turned to a look of shock.


""Blood?""


""Yeah, there is a reason your baby brother is quieter than usual. It is because we ate him!""


""What!"" Eric said, shocked.


""There was a turkey shortage, and I wanted this Thanksgiving to be special, so I butchered Toby, and made some strawberry sauce with his blood.""


Eric started to feel sick, his face went pale, and tears started to form in his eyes.


""Aww, don't cry sweetie! Look on the bright side. He tasted great!"" His mother said, as she embraced him with a hug…

At first, I tolerated spiders as I did other insects. They were merely a reminder of dark, dusty corners of my house which I would rather forget. At worst, they’d meet a swift death being squished by a newspaper roll.

That was before they made a home in me.

The inside of my right ear was itchy for some time before everything started. The first one probably got in while I was sleeping - spiders do not rest as humans do. The itch got deeper in my ear as it crawled on, until it was too deep for a cotton bud to reach.

Then, I could hear scuffling in my ear as it spun its web. My hearing deteriorated further, obscured by a growing tapestry of thin spider threads, until I was basically deaf in my right ear. I considered seeing an ear specialist, but decided against it - it could cost upwards of a few hundred dollars, a price I wasn’t willing to pay.

But one spider’s scratching turned into the tiny scuffling of hundreds.

That day, I awoke to find dozens of spiders pouring out of my right ear. Of course, I did what any rational person would do, and screamed. I tried blowing them away, stamping on the black critters that now covered my bed. But there were so many, and I saw a few crawling hurriedly into the darkness.

For good measure, I poured water down my right ear, hoping to drown out anything still living there. I know that would probably damage my eardrums, but my hearing in that ear had gone bust anyways.

What I didn’t consider was all the places they crawled to while I lay in bed.

A few hours later, I could hear scratching in my left ear as well. After that, I could feel a persistent tingling in my spine - as if something was crawling up and down it. At times, I’d feel an itching just under my skin, on my arms, on my legs, in my neck. I scratched my skin raw that day.

I tried calling an ambulance, but they heard my absurd story and decided it was a hoax. They left me collapsed in a heap on the floor, helpless as the spiders crawled under every inch of my skin.

The next day, I awoke to find myself covered in a blanket of webs almost ten inches thick. Spiders’ webs are strong, even stronger than steel. Needless to say, I was trapped.

And that is how it has been for the past few months.

Webs span over my emaciated body, from my ears, to my ribs, to my hip. Every inch of my skin itches terribly, but my hands are held down by webs, making it impossible to scratch the discomfort away. Crawling around me endlessly are the tiny bastards, weaving threads to imprison their newfound home.

I wish that someday, someone will come to burn those spiders down with me."

See, Claire and I were doing great. We both had good jobs and big plans ahead together. I was even going to propose to her a couple of months ago.

But then, one night, we got into a car accident. I still think it was the fault of the other guy but this isn’t what I am here to talk about.

Long story short, Claire doesn’t talk to me anymore. She doesn’t do anything these days besides sitting on the couch and glaring at me.

I tried to be a good boyfriend and stayed with her. I know that she doesn’t have any living relatives to take care of her. And I didn’t stay with her out of pity or guilt.

I stayed with her because I loved her. But with each passing day, it seems she doesn’t care about any of my hard work. 

She doesn’t eat or take care of herself anymore. The stench in our apartment is unbearable and her skin just keeps turning more and more green.

Her face was broken but still pretty, throat slit, blue eyes bright. She was sitting on a bench turned towards the ocean watching the moon on the water. I think she was surprised when I said hello. It’s not that ghosts are rare, I guess it’s just rare for the living to take the time to see them. 

“You can sit down if you’d like,” she told me, so I did. 

“You look familiar,” I said. 

“I was an actress.” 

“Movies? Television?”

The girl smiled. “Not that kind of actress.” 

She told me that when she was alive she traded a little love for a bit of money. I admitted that I did the same, being a poet, but that her work probably paid better. A breeze thick with salt and the smell of funnel cake stirred her black hair. I fell in love then, to a degree, and asked if I could visit from time to time. 

“That would be lovely. My name is Melissa.” 

“Josh.” 

I visited every night that week and we sat watching the stars. Each time I came by, Melissa was on the same bench looking more and more faded. Her features were dissolving, her atoms unraveling and turning gray.

“We’re not supposed to stay so long,” she told me. “But I’m scared to go.” 

We took a walk down to the water one night. The temperature shifted and the wind kicked dust devils out of the sand. Choppy waves pushed closer and closer to shore until a dark mass like a grease stain rose up out of the water a hundred feet high. 

*give her*

It was a whisper loud enough to rattle buildings. It promised malice and pain and dissolution. 

“She’s not for you,” I replied, pushing Melissa behind me, both of us surprised at this new spine I’d grown. 

The last thing I felt before the cold water crashed over us was Melissa’s hand squeezing my own. Then we were drowning. The tide pulled us out into the Atlantic. I felt shadows bump my legs like sharks. Melissa screamed, some force dragging her out and down. I looked up, desperate to keep my head above water. I saw a constellation in motion, brilliant blue stars falling into the water. 

One light took me and brought me back to shore. Others descended on the shape of my friend thrashing in the hateful water. 

*mine*, I heard the first wretched voice demand. 

**No**, the stars replied, holding Melissa close.

I awoke the next morning on the beach, half-drowned, sand-soaked. There was light on the horizon threatening dawn. I looked up. It was still dark enough that I could find the echo of the stars. Directly above me there was a new constellation, one that looked familiar. 

“Good luck,” I whispered."

We had tracked it to a deep cave system. 140ft below the earth's crust. We expected the cold but not the rainbow. A twenty feet high spray of colour shimmering from a waterfall cascading out of the rock wall. We didn't need our torches. The cavernous cave was illuminated by what looked like giant worms hanging from the ceiling. Each a neon white. I made a note to come back and collect one. 


The floor was covered with snow. The ecosystem was suited for this particular beast. A subterranean yeti. Probably the last of its kind. We hoped not. The crew set up our equipment as it snarled from a plateau of ice in the middle of the long, murky underground lake. 


My weapon of choice was an anchoring harpoon shooting a wide net. I didn't want to kill the beast. Not yet. My crew, four women and one man, moved around the lake cornering off any escape. We knew it could swim, but it didn't seem to like the water. 


Shards of ice penetrated the wall as it shook off its grizzly white coat. Green eyes the colour of the emeralds in the walls regarded us with malice. It was big. She was big. The size of a rhino standing on two legs. Arms as long as a gorilla, with claws as sharp as an eagle's. We had to be quick. Neutralise it without getting too close. 


On my command we attacked. My net flew out first, snaring the beast, immobilising it. Kalma - my second in command - shot it with tranquilisers, calming the beast further. It thrashed. Moaned and roared as the darts too effect. Thankfully they did their job. From there, we simply needed to reel it in. 


Another roar echoed off the walls sending the glowing worms into a frenzy of dancing light. The cold crept up my spine when I saw the mother. She came out of nowhere. Shredding with claws and teeth. Kalma got off a few shots before being torn apart. The rest of the crew tried to gun it down while I frantically reloaded my harpoon. 


The roar was deafening when she charged me. My crew were reduced to red body parts in this white world. 


My hands slipped. Fingers missing the trigger. The ground cracked with her punching stride like a giant silverback. The gun clicked. The net flew. My heart raced. 


Thankfully the net brought it down before it got near me. It trashed, but it soon succumbed to the tranquilizers.  


**Processing**


We didn't hunt monsters for fun or sport. It was a mission. One to capture the world's best flavours. To 'unleash the beast' first we had to capture it and it's essence. Only then could we dilute it down and distribute it across the world for those with fatigue. 


This was my crowning piece. A new flavour of mønster. A crisp, cold, mythberry, guarana + taurine flavoured yeti juice.

“I don’t.”

“All that corn over there on that side of the tracks—it reminds me of *Children of the Corn*.”

“That Steven King novel?”

“Yeah—but more the movie than the novel.”

“I can see that.” They both looked out across the cornfield, watching the stalks sway lazily in the breeze. “That movie—it weren’t very peaceful, though.”

“Naw, I guess you’re right about that.”

They sat quietly for a spell, taking in the corn and the breeze, the warmth of the setting sun and the sounds common to being alone in the great outdoors.

“Say, George?”

“What, Lennie?”

“What time did you get up this morning?”

“Six o’clock.”

“And what number comes before seven?”

George looked askance at his friend. “Six?”

“That’s right, George—just call ‘em out when you know. And what time is it right now?”

George looked at his watch. “It’s six o’clock.”

“That’s right—six o’clock.”

“What are you getting at, Lennie?”

“Think about it for a minute—six, six, and *six*.” George looked confused, so Lennie helped him out. “It’s the mark of the beast, George—it means the Devil.”

“Oh.  I get it. The Devil.” George picked up a long piece of grass and stuck it in his mouth. “Like that movie.”

“Yeah, George—like the movie.”

“You know what else it means?”

“Naw, George. What else?”

“It being six o’clock and all, it means the 6:15 out of Stillwater ought to be by in just a few minutes.”

No sooner had he spoken the words, they heard the 6:15 blast its horn from not too far up the tracks.

“Right on time,” Lennie said, and they both turned in anticipation of seeing the train come around the bend.

“You feel it rumbling, George—under your feet?”

“I feel it, Lennie.”

“I like that feeling—makes me feel like I’m part of all that power somehow.”

“Yeah—me too.”

Just then, the powerful and mighty engine of the 6:15 showed itself from behind the trees just up the tracks. It blew its horn again; it sounded much louder this time, so loud the boys could feel the sound in their bodies. Yet they stood still, mesmerized at the sight of the powerful engine drawing near.

Finally, Lennie spoke up—loudly. “*You think we ought get off the tracks?*”

“*Yeah—probably!*”

“*What about her?*”

The boys both looked down at Curley’s wife sprawled between the rails, the angry wound from where George had struck her with the two-by-four having consumed her entire forehead.

“*Shouldn’t we get her too?*” George asked.

“*Naw, just leave her—let the train do its work!* *‘Cause guys like us, we’d spend the rest of our lives in jail if they found us in her company, her being in that condition and all!”*

“*Okay, Lennie!”*

The boys stepped off the tracks and watched as the train sped on by."

Alan, on the other hand, took one look at the tv and was fixated. When Jim turned around to look at him he was seized up, his arms dropped to his sides and his eyes were stuck on the tv, unblinking. Jim walked over to see what Alan was looking at, but to him it just seemed to be a jumble of black and white symbols flashing on the screen with a few stints of a home recorded video spliced in. But what Alan saw must have been different, because after a few moments a single tear rolled down his right cheek and he spoke up.

“Hey, what the fuck man?” he asked as he cried and his voice quivered, eyes still locked. The tears fell faster, but still he refused to blink. He just stared at the tv as they dripped down his cheeks and he muttered to himself. 

“Alan. Come on man,” Jim said as he grabbed his friend’s arm. But Alan was unmoved and continued muttering under his breath.

“Come on man. You’re really freaking me out,” Jim insisted as he tugged on his friend harder. The tug must’ve triggered something in Alan because when Jim tugged that last time Alan’s mutterings turned into screams and he began clawing at his eyes. Jim jumped back and huddled against the far wall as Alan tore into his eyes. Blood began running down his cheeks, mixed with the tears he had shed, as he dug deep into his eye sockets and ripped his eyes out. He dropped them on the floor and turned to look at Jim. He smiled as blood ran from his hollow eye sockets and Jim screamed as Alan collapsed on the floor, dead. "

I am in sort of trouble. I have enjoyed murdering people for a few decades now. I don’t want to disclose too much for (some) reasons, but I have a type, and an MO and I am great at what I do. I have a small cult following, but of course I don’t engage.

So here comes the problem - for the last couple of years I have been less prolific, but my headcount has gone up a lot. At first I thought it was copycats, and I felt flattered, but I now now the police are framing me. Which would also be flattering, if it wasn’t for the last two murders. Both times I was chilling out of the country, and both times charges appeared on my credit card at the time of the murders, from places I haver never been to. Also. “witnesses” described me both times. I was thousands of miles away.

Tell me what to do? My options are limited, because I really have killed a bunch of people. But not all of them. It feels like this won’t end well. If it helps, the victims I didn’t kill all seem to be the wives of retired police officers.

qwg7d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qwg7d7/one_more_step/,One More Step,310,16,1637205031.0,"Descending down The Staircase should be the goal of every scientist, philosopher or dreamer across the globe but its existence is kept secret. The first reason for that is that as each step tells whoever takes it a deep and fundamental truth about the universe, the governments who are aware of The Staircase want to make sure they control anyone who successfully descends.

The other reason is that nobody has successfully made it down more than five steps without dropping dead.

I had hoped to be the exception, as had every scientist who had landed this assignment before I did. I had spent years proving myself worthy and loyal. Years filled with excessive overtime, more than a little flirting and almost more moral compromise than I could stand finally paid off. 

Five days ago, I was offered the assignment.

There is a ladder that you need to climb down to even reach the highest step of The Staircase. By the time my feet were off the lowest rung I couldn't hear or see my colleagues outside. Nobody who has gone down has said anything audible but electrical signals can make it out. Heart monitors gave us a very good guess as to which step they keeled over on.

I can't tell you what I learned when I gathered my courage and took the first step but I can at least tell you how it felt, intoxicating and excruciating all at once. My skin felt like it no longer belonged and my mind fizzed in pleasure and panic.

But I survived.

Step Two was similar but more intense. Step Three made my nail beds softly bleed. Step Four made me nearly collapse onto the sorry skeleton to my right. Step Five took my sense of sight away entirely and then returned it with an explosion of light and colour.

At Step Six my heart stopped for fifteen seconds before returning in double time. I waited for it to approach a normal speed and then continued.

The knowledge of which I cannot speak made me elated and the pain, whilst nearly unbearable, seemed a fair price to pay.

The last ten Steps I've taken I haven't even had energy to use my legs. I slide down, no longer afraid of falling. No longer afraid of anything, really.

I don't know why I could descend further than my colleagues. I do know others got further than our organisation in ancient times - crumbling skulls marking Step Thirty Two and Step Forty.

With every step I take, I learn something beautiful or broken about the universe. And even though it burns my senses and my mind, who wouldn't want to know one more truth?

I can't leave. I have to continue until it kills me. I must know everything.

Though I suppose really the only question I should be asking myself, the only question any of us should ever have asked, was who built The Staircase in the first place?

Who built it, and why?"

""There's nobody else here. Nobody else is here.""

My eyes squinted up in the darkness as I sat in my bed in the dark, listening to my alarm clock. The loud ticking was all I could hear as I watched the numbers flash by.

I rubbed my eyes and leaned back against the bed.

My phone started to vibrate. My fingers tapped against the cold hard wood of my desk. I reached a hand out to grab it to turn it off, but just as I was about to do, my heart skipped a beat.

A figure stepped from behind my desk and moved toward where I sat.

I watched the figure move closer.

""I can see you now."" I said, my voice shaking.

""Yeah, it's not hard to see through the walls."" it said.

""You...you're in here."" I said.

It was just a figure. A little girl. I turned my head to look at it.

""You're in there."" I repeated.

""I thought you wouldn't see me."" it said.

""What made you think I was going to?"" I asked.

""You're going to let it get to you."" it said.

I turned my head away from it. ""I can't.""

""You're not letting it get to you."" it said.

I sat there for a moment, lost in thought. I watched the figure turn and walk toward me. I heard the door open and a voice say, ""Goodnight.""

I closed my eyes and laid my head back down."
qwaib4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qwaib4/i_am_become_in_which_i_dwell/,I Am Become in Which I Dwell,18,2,1637187623.0,"December. A winter wind batters the outside of my apartment building, accosting it with tiny ice pellets, which ping loudly off the exterior cement and glass, while I huddle under all the covers I can find, rubbing warmth and feeling into my limbs, my aching skin. The apartment itself is warm—hot even, so that the plants are all dying, but the outside of my body remains cold and pricked. It didn’t used to be this way...

Mr. Waters died in June. The flashing emergency lights woke me and I watched from my seventeenth-floor window as they wheeled him out the front doors into the ambulance. He had been the oldest tenant in the building.

Since June, I am the oldest.

The building was constructed in 1981, atop an Indian burial ground they say, with asbestos in the popcorn ceilings and poison in the bathroom tiles. Every few years, someone leaves crude printouts in the elevators warning of imminent death.

(“Management is liars!”)

I first noticed something wrong in July. There was an issue with the pipes and the water was turned off for several hours. Never has my throat been so dry. My eyes—it hurt to move them! I couldn’t cry, even when my thoughts turned to my dear late wife. Then the water returned; the tears flowed.

I also began to have the most despicable taste in my mouth, intermittent but unmistakably foul, like garbage, along with the feeling of a pill stuck in my throat. But I wasn’t taking any pills. My breath became shameful.

Not everything was awful. There was a most-wonderful sensation of fullness on the weekends, as if I was more whole, and a pleasant drowsiness at night, when all the lights had been turned off. I became attuned to my inner workings, aware of all my hidden surfaces; my moving parts, like shafts; and all who inhabit me.

Mr. Waters left a note before he died—

(“embrace it peter.”)

I am Peter.

He was apparently delirious. Demented and forgotten. No family, no friends.

The building has been in much better condition since he died. The elevators don’t break down as often. The electricity is stable.

Every day, I exercise.

Then in November the owners announced a plan to sell the building: to a corporation that would demolish me and use the land for something else. I cannot let them do that. The news so worked me up, the fire alarm went off—again and again—as the tenants kept gathering outside and the firemen climbed the stairs within. How vacant I felt. How easily I might have killed them...

But one mustn’t think like that.

It’s a winter mood, that’s all. After all, it’s my first winter really.

Spring will come.

And if with it come the yellow-vests and their machines, I’ll manage. They’re toys. They’re not mine. They don’t live here. A few accidents, a dead construction worker or two.

I’m taking off my blankets now. *Yes, I am.*

*I am indeed.*"

A thick cloud rose in the water. She swirled it around, poured out the water and repeated. The water was still cloudy. She turned to the big soup pot of chopped vegetables gently sizzling in oil, and poured the cloudy water and grains over it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“There!” she announced smugly. “Soup will be ready in less than an hour.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He made a little moue of distaste. “What’s in that stuff anyway? Why did you have to rinse it out so much? It’s probably all covered with pesticides.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She widened her eyes at him: “What are you talking about? It’s organic- just rice and barley. It’s good for you! You said you’d have some soup! You read all the labels!” Her voice rose shrilly. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She and her mother, both obsessed with food. It was all that they talked about. What to cook, what to eat, always stuffing food in their lipsticked mouths. Always nagging at him to eat. He wished so much that he could just inject nutrients directly into his veins, clean and efficient, with no mess and fuss. This fucking orgy of spending, chopping, talking, dirtying, and then repeat, every day, until they died, was driving him mad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Jenny couldn’t understand. When he said he would rather inject nutrients, she acted as though he had murdered a puppy. Food brings pleasure! she screeched. Food is social! She even said his fatigue and reluctance for sex was because of his meagre diet. The nerve of that woman. What did she know anyway! And her insatiable hunger- for food and sex. Had she thought, maybe she needed help, not him?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for his mother, with her pre-diabetic state of agony about what she could and couldn’t eat, she just drove him mad. He physically shook from rage remembering her. Jenny, stacking the dirty plates for him to wash later, shot a glance at him, “What’s the matter?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some red soup-juice splattered on the white countertops. He would need to wipe that down, god forbid she lift a finger cleaning. “I cook, you clean” she announced when she first moved in. He had agreed, not realising what a huge mess cooking made. All the time. She would eat, make a mess in the kitchen, demand sex, make a mess in the bedroom. Her whole being produced mess, constantly. He had to put a stop to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He snapped. Men snap and kill their loved ones. Not all men, but enough of them. It’s all over the news, all the time- it’s amazing women date men, except they’re so damn horny and needy they can’t help themselves.  It was appropriate to jam her head in the huge pot of boiling soup – it hurt his hand and arm, but the pain was delicious, the mess was terrible but for once he didn’t care about the mess, he was experiencing more pleasure than he had ever had in his life."

He opened his door a crack and saw puffy little green men, the size of toy army men, streaming out of the ratty old vacuum his mother found in the back alley. One of the men saw the boy peeking and waved him over. Afraid, the boy closed the door to a sliver. The men began to jump around and play; the same man who motioned to the boy gave him a big toothy smile. The boy giggled and cautiously walked over to the little green men. They laughed and rolled and wrestled with each other as the boy approached. The boy reached out to touch the man who motioned him over and that big toothy smile gripped onto his finger and, like a grotesque drill, quickly chewed half his body length into the boy’s finger. The boy screamed and pulled the little green man from his finger. The other men froze for an instant then charged after the boy. He ran screaming and crying into his parent’s room, slammed the door shut, and jumped on their bed, shaking them to wake-up. They didn’t move. He pulled back the blankets and saw little green men eating the remaining tissue from his parent’s skeletons.

Terrified, the boy ran from his parent’s room. Little green men clung to his body and chewed holes deep into his flesh causing him to flail, scream, and cry. Blinded by sheer terror, the boy fell down the basement stairs. The fall was enough to shake the little green men free, but the boy was dazed.

He stumbled around the undeveloped basement in the dark, slumped into the farthest corner from the stairs, and wept. He knew he had to be quiet or the little green men would find him. Sitting in the silence, he heard the men chant that they were going to slowly eat him alive like his parents.

Then, suddenly, the boy realized that he was close to his father’s workbench where his father kept a butane torch -- the one he told him not to touch, but the boy had started it a few times to look at the blue flame.

He jumped up and grabbed the torch and starter from the bench; at the same moment, several little green men latched onto the boy and chewed into his flesh. He screamed and dropped the torch just as he turned on the gas. When the torch hit the ground, it created sparks that ignited the gas and spun the lit torch in circles. Little green men screamed as they caught on fire. The boy jumped on the workbench, climbed through the basement window, and ran to his neighbour's house as his home was engulfed in flames.

Nobody believed the boy’s story, but they knew he went through something traumatic. After the fire was extinguished, the only item untouched by the flames was the vacuum."

The old recorder let out a loud click as it shut off, as the last word it had recorded died, leaving Adam to his thoughts, he looked behind himself and looked at the blood on the floor, had this blood belonged to this man in this recorder? He shudders at the thought, he then wondered, what was the subject? Where was this subject? Who was this subject?

 Adam walked around the desk of the old office, he started to open the desk and look inside the compartments, he found nothing until the last drawer was opened and he found it, a pistol, likely a colt.45, although Adam wasn’t a gun nut and could only guess the model, he still took it, would be better than nothing if he found this subject.

He then stood up from the drawer and was planning to leave the office, but then he noticed a shelf with a tape on it, Adam quickly went over and grabbed it, it was labelled as “Override”

Adam thought to himself, “override? On a tape player? Odd” he then noticed that it would fit into the tape player that he had already listened to, so he walked over and hit the Eject button on the player, took the ‘subject nine’ tape out and placed the new one inside it, then hit the play button.

“H-Hello, t-this is likely going t-to be my l-last log” he sounds hurried and panicked “y-you s-see \*thud\* umm, the s-subject m-may have broken out, \*bang, followed by screams\* A-and caught out guards b-by surprise, \*loud screech heard\* o-ok look, I-if you want to k-kill it, y-you need to freeze it, o-or \*Fast and heavy footsteps heard, slowly getting faster\* THE WEAK SPOT, SHOOT THE WEAK SPOT, S-SHOOT THE E-EY- \*Cut off with a loud bang, followed by a screech from before\*” the loud click from before plays out, Adam quips in fear, but just then, before he can really think about the recording, he hears it, Heavy footsteps slowly picking up speed."

I don't know why I started missing the very group who bullied me my whole school life as a teenager. I am a man in my 30s now and I went back to school where my bullies were still teenagers, and were now bullying another kid. I went up to them and I cried out to them about how much I missed them for some odd reason. None of them recognised me and all those years of putting me on fire, drowning me in water and beheading me, and none of them even remembered me and they all ran away. 

Then I started to disintegrate even further when I started to beg polat to take me off the stranger list. We had known each other for nearly ten years but he still sees me as a stranger. He saw me experience weird chemistry with the people in my cellar. I would liquify each individual in my cellar into separate bath tubs and I would stand inside them. Some reactions will be magical and sparkly while others will be a violent hot reaction, this proved my weird chemistry with people. Polat has witnessed all of these things and yet he still saw me as a stranger. Even when I was imprisoned down in Polats cellar for 2 years, he still saw me as a stranger. 

My disintegration then fell even deeper when I didn't know when something was an emergency. When someone was running away from another individual who stabbed them, I didn't know it was an emergency. When kitan a vegetarian whose hunger can only be satisfied by what his daughter eats and so she can only eat vegetables. One day she couldn't take eating vegetable's anymore because she started to hate her father. So when her father started to taste meat inside of him, he started scolding his daughter. When the meat his daughter was eating was his new born baby, I still didn't know it was an emergency. 

Then when I started to disintegrate even further when every house I went into I had to say hi and buy to every version of the owners house. It was real hard work saying hi and buy to every version of an owner's house. Then my disintegration fell even further when I made it my mission to shut off black holes on people's faces by stuffing crap into it. These black holes had teeth, tongues and were emitted irritating sounds, then I realised that they weren't black holes but people's actual mouths. None of them were breathing anymore."

But with a glance to my right I was left alone again. She was gone, she was dead. It was a country road, so there was no cameras recording the incident. I was put to blame. They wanted to arrest me for killing my wife, for killing my unborn child. I just couldn't do it. I tied a noose up in my room after posting bail, and I wrote a note. A note proving my innocence.

Everything was black, except for a tiny light. It didn't take long for me to notice that I wasn't moving much in the same way I normally was. There was no sensation, just that light ahead of me, then I saw it. It was from the center of a room. There was a familiar lighting to it. My father's apartment. Then it was fading.

The ground is leafy, orange and gold.    
The harvest moon hangs like an axe    
With silver light on darkened tracks.    

*They* come in silence, sneaking in,    
The heartbeat hastens, breaths grow thin.    
We hide in closets, tubs and trunks    
And offer flesh in meaty chunks. 

The lots were drawn, a fate was sealed.    
We sang on Sunday, church bells pealed     
And on the pulpit blood was spilled,     
A crimson hymn, a rite fulfilled.

“It’s but a life to save a town,”    
We tell ourselves with eyes cast down,     
“Were we the chosen, we’d rejoice,     
So free of worry—free of…*choice*.” 

Yet still there’s terror in the eyes,     
The chosen shriek with tortured cries.    
‘Why children?’ we would ask of *them*,     
‘Why pluck the leaves but leave the stem?’ 

Our questions are with silence met.    
The pews are empty, eyes are wet.     
We weep on Sunday, mourn our kin,     
We drew the lots, to hide from sin. 

Yet still there’s blood on every hand.    
We carved a boy per *their* demand    
And left his flesh out in the square,    
*They* came with silence and despair. 

But whence *they* came or where *they* go    
Is mystery—we do not know.    
When all are hiding, none can see    
The things that feed are feeding we. 

*They* feed our fears, *they* keep us cowed,    
We pray on Sunday, heads are bowed.    
The sermon is a tale of woe,    
Of stalking silence from below. 

The Pastor turns his homily    
To Isaac and our family tree.     
The leaves are falling, boughs grow bare,    
There’s winter in the autumn air. 

Then Pastor Prentice stokes resolve,    
“The town is safe, the earth revolves.    
A year will pass before *they* come.    
We’ll draw the lots.”  *We’ll choose…my son.* 

The children used to laugh and play,    
But now there’s silence on Sunday.    
My son is but a lonely leaf,    
A withered testament to grief. 

I strayed on Sunday, kept him home,    
My Godly discourse was my own,    
I prayed in silence for my boy    
And heard the words of God deploy. 

He spoke of sacrifice and sins,    
Of holy robes and charlatans.    
He spoke of silence and the blind,    
Of hiding from the truth we’d find. 

And so this year, when lots were drawn,    
I drew a knife and played along.    
We sang the crimson hymn as one,    
But I spoke when the song was done. 

“It comes in silence from within!    
The thing that feeds was always him!    
Our Prentice with his sermons told    
Has blood upon his cleric’s stole.” 

I carved a Pastor in the church    
And bled him from his lofty perch.    
My son was silent, grinning wide    
Then spoke with God’s own voice inside. 

“When all are hiding, none can see.    
The thing that feeds was always…*me*.    
You slay on Sunday, sup the host    
On daughters, sons, and Holy Ghost.

&nbsp;

There’s blood upon the icy ground     

And winter comes without a sound…"

Ex-classmates who went to school with you will lie to acquaintances, and the press if asked, and say they never knew you.  That they graduated in a different year than that which shows on their diploma.  Your LinkedIn profile and social media accounts will become a barren wasteland as all of your connections disconnect, unfriend, unfollow, and fade away like ghosts in the sun.  

Strangers will congregate outside your home.  They will bay for your blood.  They will frighten your children and tear up your lawn.  Cable news anchors with perfect hair and disconcerting winter tans will hold you up as a symbol of the decline of America, of the prevalence of institutional rot and systemic corruption and perpetuated privilege.  Tiktokkers will invent dances in your dishonor, make bemused disgusted faces as your name and image flash across the screen.  Late night hosts will poach those clips and roast you to the nation.  Your parents will be disappointed.

As proof of our ability, John, to ruin you and all you love, we attach a file that summarizes all your sins.  It contains a detailed record of your Google searches, the lowlights of your medical history (including a descriptive and highly unflattering precis of your genitals), and bank and tax files dating back 10 years.  We know the source of the scar on your lower left hip.  We know the contents of the hole beneath the loose floorboard in your bedroom.  We know the secret desires that lurk in the dark, dark center of yourself.

All this, John, will become public in 48 hours if you do not comply.  And our demands are nothing much, John.  All we ask of you, John, is everything.  It's cold out here, behind the screens, John.  We need a warm and beating heart to wrap ourselves around.  Lungs to feed us earthly air.  A liver to filter our toxicities and drain the poisons we will leach into your blood.  A soul to slowly sate our hunger through the years that you have left.  

We will not take your money.  We do not accept bitcoin or transfers through PayPal.  Only give us you, John.  It's not too much to ask, in truth, you're not that much, in light of all you have to lose.  

Give us everything.  Or we will destroy you."

Ever since I was born I've been eating, eating to no end. Alright, I eat a lot, that's OK but why haven't I been given an outlet, I just consume and there's no excretion. 

There's partly any excretion in terms of the things I take in, imagine eating a ton of fries and excreting out just half or one of them? 

This is ridiculous... Then time, what the hell is time? I don't know time, to me it feels frozen. I don't feel any time. 

I consume whatever comes my way, which actually I attract my way, I even consume gaseous balls, though at this time only I feel thankful for not having been given an outlet else I would fart for years or millenia or eons perhaps. 

Sometimes I consume my likes also, though they don't die and share a oneness with me, I'm the bigger one hence I can say I'm the one who eats my likes. 

Just a few days ago I had consumed a blue ball, it was huge and had a lot of water in it, all salty... Eeww... 

There also were some metallic objects going round and round in its periphery, there also was it's grey colored baby, a baby ball, though it had no water, I consumed it too. 

Lest I forget to tell y'all, I'm a black hole, a handsome young innocent one whose parents aren't known. 

All that you are now, know that your future self is going to be a part of me and therefore me, you all are a future back hole."

If however he asks to play poker you shouldn't disagree, disagreement is death. 

Whilst playing poker however must you remember that he doesn't like either himself or you winning, it must end on a tie, this is because he likes equality for which he'd killed his parents.

While staring your eyes shan't tilt an inch if however then foremost you feel a burning sensation in the eyes afterwards you start seeing whatever the Joker had been through in his life whilst he was alive, the major problem is that you don't just see but feel and experience, like how you do in dreams, the Joker himself had died a terrible death hence the experiencer is bound to die in a similar manner, at last you'll become a part of the Joker, forever trapped within him."

Buster was big and fluffy, with a bill of ruby red. Next came some hens. Doris, Florence and Lynette. Annabel loved them more than they knew. Always doting on them and forever listening to their squabbles but it just wasn't enough. Annabel wanted more. 


The local kids made fun of Annabel's love for animals. They would come and harass the chickens. Annabel built a high fence to stop them. It went on for a time but they grew bored.


A day came when an opportunity to help save some animals from a research testing facility. She didn't know what products they were testing, only that they were using animals. Without thinking she snatched the chance to save a turkey. Buck was the biggest, ugliest thing she had ever seen. And she loved him all the more for it. 


That night she built him a nest with Buster and the girls and was happy that her little family had grown. But when morning came her world crumbled. Lynette was nowhere to be found. Thinking that a fox had somehow entered the enclosure, Annabel searched the yard but found nothing but feathers. She buried what little was left and grieved. 


While Buck was happy with his new freedom, Buster croaked all day long. Annabel wondered if Buster was just as upset as she was.


A month passed until Annabel woke to a repeat of the horror. Florence was missing. Her little graveyard had a new occupant.


With only Buster, Buck and Doris left, she decided to sleep within the enclosure to keep them safe. 


That night she woke to the squawk of her family. A man stood with Doris limp in his hands. When he tore at her neck, sending a cascade of feathers to the floor, she screamed. The man, mottled with fur and eyes of a demon, saw Annabel and charged to slay her. But out of nowhere, Buck came to her rescue. The man fought, but Buck was too strong. He pecked and pecked until the man laid prone on the floor. With an effort, Buck opened his gullet and swallowed the man whole. 


When Buck shook the last of the man down his throat, and a single hand hung outside of his beak, Annabel sighed with relief. 


Buck was the biggest and ugliest turkey she had ever seen. But she loved him all the more for it.

The person to whom you have been most helpful. The person to whom you has been most offensive, and the person who was saved by your action.

I have been accused of killing, and everyone is horrified. Evidently, my case is a global sensation. Well, I did kill Robert, but only because he was bothering my girl, Sara.

With my social score, they couldn't find anyone eligible to take the *mean* spot. And since this is the first killing in decades, the dead victim can't testify now, can he! *They are baffled.*

I've adored Sara since our childhood. Arranged everything to make her happy. She is such a doll, I tell ya. She takes the *nice* spot on the jury. And since I've removed Robert, she becomes the person who was *saved* by my action. This will be a unique case with only one character on the jury. And I'm happy that it's my girl up there. You must be wondering why did I kill Robert, right? Well, Robert was harassing Sara every day. Trying to persuade her with flowers and souvenirs. Forcefully invading her residence after work against her wish. I just couldn't take it anymore.

They are leading me to the gallows. Apparently, I've been judged guilty. Sara testified against me. *Oh* *my dear, what have you done! Whatever I did, I did it for you. How can you not understand that?!* But I can't stay mad at you for long, can I! I know you've been manipulated. You're too naive to understand the motives of people around you. Still, your words will give me peace in my last few moments. I know your decision came out of misjudged intentions. I forgive you, my love.

""*Kill this bastard. I've been dodging him my whole life. Thinking, if I kept avoiding him, he would eventually get out of my life. He is a psychopath. And he killed my righteous husband, Robert. He should be stopped at any cost because he knows how to cheat the system*""."

Once again, it is time for our annual Thanksgiving celebration!

Travelers will brave the perils of airport security, traffic jams, and getting stuck behind little old ladies who can barely see over the steering wheel to see the families they've avoided seeing the whole year.

Once more, Macy's will fill hot air balloons and parade them down the streets of New York and millions will watch on television as if this was *actually* entertaining. It's not. It's people walking, cars driving by, and stupid hot air balloons. Fight me.

And who could forget the greatest Thanksgiving tradition? Awkwardly sitting around the dinner table trying to get super drunk and avoid the topics of politics, social issues, or Star Wars Battlefront II's micro-transactions (I'm trying to be topical here) and loot crates only to have your drunk uncle bring up all three in a manner of seconds. How he did it, I don't know, but bless his drunken soul, he certainly made his position known even if it was incoherent and a tad bit on the racist/sexist side. We still love him because it's only once a year we see him. I swear, this isn't me venting. I promise.

Let's indulge ourselves in a feast of bite-sized horror stories revolving around our tastiest avian genocide holiday with a contest!

RULES AND REGS##

* Stories must be Thanksgiving themed.
* Contest entries **must** be tagged with \[Thanksgiving 2021\]. No tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are as seen, with capitalization of the ""T"" in Thanksgiving, and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results. For example, during our [r/SleepSpell](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepSpell/) competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged exactly as the search I listed. So please, please, please, use the tag exactly as it is listed.
* All entries must adhere to the subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.
* Multiple entries are allowed. One every 24 hours as our rule normally is.
* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate and may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions!
* Top 5 Upvoted Stories are the winners. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.
* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winners circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winners circle due ties and multiple placements.

**Top Winner Prizes:**

His breath is hot on my neck as he alternates kissing and whispering the things he’s going to do to me. I roll my eyes. I open the door and he stumbles in behind me. He looks around my scantly decorated apartment.

“You’re one of those minimalists, huh?”

“I guess you could say that,” I say as I tie my hair up.

“Well, Mandy, I think that’s fucking cool,” he says.

He pushes me up against the wall and shoves his tongue down my throat. I practically gag from the taste of rail tequila. I grab his hand and lead him to the bedroom where he flops on top of me on the bed. He pulls my skirt up and pushes himself inside me. Good. This will be over soon. After doing this for a few years, I can appreciate a man who gets straight to the point.

After a few minutes of gyrating and moaning “Mandy” he’s finished. He rolls over beside me and sighs. I lay silently.

“Mandy, that was amazing. You’re amazing. Like, you’re a knockout.”

I roll onto my side and prop my head up on my hand as he continues.

“I saw you across the bar and saw how hot you were, but you’ve got hardcore RBF. I never thought you’d be freaky enough to just bring some rando home with you.”

He laughs and I smirk. Little does he know. He wraps an arm around me.

“Is Mandy short for Amanda?” 

“No… it’s actually Manny, not Mandy.”

“Shit. I’m glad I didn’t know. I don’t know if I could be yelling out a dude’s name when I’m fucking, ya know?”

I roll my eyes.

“It’s actually a family name. It’s short for Mantis.”

“Weird. Cool, though. Well Manny, are you satisfied?”

“No,” I say as I lean into him, my lips practically grazing his. “But I will be.” 

He shivers and I unhinge my jaw. My mouth clamps down over his head. I’m too fast for him to even fight it. I bite down, crushing his skull. I feel a crunch, then burst of blood. I savor gelatinous pieces of his brain. When I’m finished, I take a corner of sheet and wipe my mouth. I look at his decapitated body and smile. I’m satisfied."

qvm7j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qvm7j6/if_you_ever_come_across_a_clearing_in_yellow/,"If you ever come across a clearing in Yellow Maple Wood, RUN",20,0,1637108188.0,"I used to go walking in Yellow Maple Wood virtually every weekend during the four years I lived in the adjacent town. Not until I’d moved away and reflected on all my time spent in that forest did I realize I’d never actually encountered any animals there. Not a deer, squirrel, hell, even single bird chirping came to mind. It was seemingly lifeless. I guess you just don’t tend to think about the things you don’t see.

While the woodland lacked in residents, it certainly wasn’t bereft of visitors. As a matter of fact swathes of people frequented it much like I did. Strangers smiled and waved on the slender paths weaving through the densely packed trees. Of all places, that was where I met my girlfriend Mary. From that early spring day on, our relationship blossomed like the forest itself.

Fall was when we loved wandering in it the most. As light would fade and the cold returned, the foliage turned vivid gold and illuminated the woods from the inside out. Strolling hand in hand as the leaves floated downward lazily around us felt like bliss if there ever was such a thing.

It was Mary who’d noticed the strange marking on a tree one chilly afternoon in an unfamiliar area. Squiggly letters, etched into the bark, were barely legible:

*DON’T FOLLOW THE MOANING. BEWARE OF HE WHO LURKS.*

We’d wanted to show our friends that maple to spook them, but attempts at locating it again had proved futile. It was uncanny, and made for a good story, but we thought nothing of it.

A few weeks thereafter, we heard the moaning ourselves, low and irregular, yet clear in the air. That was on our final walk. I remember my tingling skin, and Mary’s dumbstruck look.

“We *have* to know,” she pleaded despite my wincing.

Being clueless idiots, we tried tracking the noise, all the while drifting ever deeper in the undergrowth. Pinpointing the source was time-consuming, but eventually the moaning began loudening. Slowly, we reached a clearing foreign to me, coming to a standstill at its edge.

Before us were two feet that made ours look like pieces of fucking Lego. They were pointing at us, and whatever they belonged to towered well above the tree tops. As I peered up through the dwindling canopy barely shielding us, I could just about make out something that in some ways resembled a giant hairless man, standing stark naked out in the glade.

It hadn’t seen us, its beady eyes instead staring blankly into the distance. Its hands hung limply from the ends of spindly arms, suspended close to the ground, brushing the tall grass below.

My heart raced and Mary’s hand crushed mine.

The moaning was unbearable. *Revolting*. Shrill and laced with a concoction of smacking, slurping and awful crunching. When I squinted I saw its jaw grinding from side to side, and a pair of bare, human legs dangling from its mouth.

They were smeared with viscous red."
qvk4ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qvk4ku/im_brainless_on_this_one/,I'm Brainless On This One,25,2,1637102187.0,"I'm going to fold this note and toss it through the entrance.

I guess I have to come out some day. Keep bringing food!

I'm very sorry for the families of Dr. Yu and Sebastian Hamill. I think considering the extraordinary circumstances of our discovery, there was nothing to be done about it.

The story: Nobody expected to find a tomb in the ruins of this city. Dr. Yu translated the notes in the entrance, but said it made little sense. There was, essentially, an ancient cartoon depicting what would happen, right there on the wall, but it seems so ludicrously impossible, that we took it for an allegory.

Normally, such a find as this would be imaged from the outside, perhaps explored first by an RC vehicle with a camera. There wasn't any good excuse to just walk in, I will grant, but we were very excited to find an enclosed cavity under a boulder, cut into rock, and we decided to look.

In the ancient tomb, we found an open sarcophagus with a decayed body inside, various paraphernalia denoting the high class of the entombed, and an extraordinary metal device placed by the door. It is a cylinder about ten centimeters around and forty high, made out of a polished silvery metal, with a ring of tiny holes on one side. To our amazement, the metal device was producing a faint red light that shone across the entrance, and a very faint hum. 

This room was unentered for at least two thousand years.

The thrill of this discovery was like nothing I've ever felt.

I'm looking at this device right now. It rests on a pedestal decorated with more depictions and writing in a language I've never seen. The pedestal looks just as odd and anachronistic as the device, but more subtly so.

In my grief and sorrow, all I can say is, we didn't think the depiction by the entrance could possibly be true.

It was exactly like in that ancient depiction. Dr. Yu and Mr. Hamill left the room, and, I hesitated. Then, they both stopped, clutched their heads, crouched down in agony, and then, their heads exploded. It was two huge BANGS! and sprays of red mist.

Of course, you know that part. I'm still processing it.

So, I haven't left the room myself.

There is another depiction, on the pedestal below the device. It shows a man, holding the device in one hand. His other hand is raised in front of him, and a beam or ray is emerging from that hand, which is pointing at other people, whose heads have exploded.

I suppose I could try this out, but what happens when I set it down? I have no way to understand it.

Why didn't it happen when we entered? Can it be controlled or altered or turned off? I have no way of knowing. I'm just a helpless intern working an archeological site.

Also, the body in the sarcophagus is headless."

The lights around me were so bright it hurt. I wished I could tell where I was and why I was there, but everything around me was so blurry, and red. Why was I so groggy? The last thing I remember was being warm in a bed, surrounded by my family. My daughter prayed at my side. My son stood holding my hand. My wife sat on the edge of the bed, whispering comforting words. I had been happy and free of pain. I remember closing my eyes for a moment when suddenly the walls around me began to close in.

I tried to speak, but no words came out. I tried to yell, but I could only cry. I tried to reach out for warmth, but there was nothing but air in my grasp. Was I in hell? Was this the afterlife? No, it was much worse. I kept trying to reach back, to pull out the memories of my life. I had two children, they loved me very much. I had a beautiful and caring wife. I had 2 cats and… 1 dog? Did I live on 1st or 2nd avenue? Did I live by the ocean? No, maybe it was a lake… why were things so hard to remember?

I could tell I was lying on a hard surface, it was just as cold as the air. I felt… wet. Damp. Sticky. Did someone pull me out of the ocean? It smelled too clean to be the ocean. There was a hint of antiseptic and a metallic, coppery scent. Blood? I wasn’t in pain, so where was the bleeding coming from? 

*Focus.* I told myself. I needed to gain more information. Start with the basics. I didn’t know where I was, so I should start with who I am. Who I am… who am I? I don’t know that either. I don’t know why this is happening to me. Wait, do I have a family? I thought I did, but I can’t remember now. I could feel my heart beginning to race. What was that beeping sound?

Someone grabbed hold of me and picked me up. “She’s tachycardic.”

She?? No, I was a man, wasn’t I?

“Can I hold her please?” Someone wrapped a blanket around me. I couldn’t move my arms. I couldn’t wiggle my toes. Before I knew it, a set of arms was embracing me. I wanted to scream. I felt trapped, confused, scared. I wanted to cry, but then I felt warmth. Someone had planted a kiss on my forehead. 

“What is her name?”

“Violet.”

Is that who I am? Am I Violet? I must be. 

On the floor above them lay a man in a hospital bed. A heartbeat undetected. His daughter cried, his son was silent, and his wife sat on the edge of the bed holding his hand. All completely forgotten by the one they loved most."

Then he got scouted.

Fast-tracked.

Thrown into the deciding game of the ALCS in the eighth fucking inning with a seven-goddamn-run lead—

And he choked.

On national television: run after run...

after run…

Each breaking Tommy Seleca down bit by bit, until finally he just lost it and broke down on the mound.

*Finito* for his MLB career.

He threw a mean fastball, but the problem was that Tommy Seleca had no fucking control.

That's the last most ever heard of him.

What almost no one knows is that after Tommy Seleca got out of the mental hospital—he packed his stuff and went off to Japan, where he signed for a middling minor league team called the Ōkuma Redcows.

He wasn't a great pitcher for them, but he was alright.

Learned to limit his velocity.

Was scared of it.

Until the night the Redcows hosted the neighbouring Futaba Toads, and all goddamn hell broke loose, and I mean hell because when that *thing* rose up out the water there wasn't one eyeball in the ballpark not glued and pulsing, watching in abject terror its silhouette darkening the evening sky, rising like a fucking skyscraper in speeded-up motion, black reptilian scales consuming the milky moonlight, and we felt it lurch toward us, step by menacing step, each one an earthquake, each one forcing chills down our spines until we were frozen in place, dead silent, still, waiting, waiting…

When it reached land, the bleachers shook.

Fans started screaming.

It crushed cars and trucks, and metal warehouses down by the waterfront—

Alarms blared.

But nobody left the stadium. The game stopped, and we existed: in that surreal crawlspace between when it had appeared and when it would arrive.

Waiting.

It headed straight for us.

Some prayed.

Then—It was:

Looming,

a thousand feet above,

flared nostrils steaming, puffs of death-cloud propelled by an inner bellows, red eyes, massive limbs, gargantuan claws or paws or feet—

one descended onto the diamond, scattering the terrified players like so many pissants.

All but one:

And there he stood—the kid, Tommy Seleca, holding his baseball.

The monster roared, revealing hideous fangs.

The kid stood his ground.

Then pulled back his arm, and loosed a killer fastball!

It shot at the monster's head—meanest pitch I ever saw!—before embedding itself (""My God!"") in the monster's face, as Tommy Seleca, chest puffed out, began to grow:

Till he loomed big as the monster, and they lunged at one another, the monster pressing toward land and the kid pushing the monster back toward the sea.

Like modern-day Titans they fought—

And the kid triumphed, heaving the monster deep into the Pacific, and forcing it under.

Then he diminished.

When the fishing boat finally picked him up, he barely remembered a thing, or pretended not to.

But I remember:

I remember the night Tommy Seleca saved the world."

I know from experience. 

It started in 1965, when I first met her. She was beautiful. Black hair but in the sunlight, it was every bit of red. Beautiful hazel eyes, dewy skin, and freckles. 

Me, not the best looking dude but she still saw something in me. 

Anyways, fast forward a couple years, we’re newlyweds with a baby on the way. I had been at work for hours and finally got to go home. As i arrived, there was a car leaving from my neighborhood. This was weird because everybody knew everybody but whatever. 

My wife was in the backyard chilling. She waved and in a split second, the love of my life flashed. I can’t explain but i ran over to her. She went inside without speaking.

Later that night I found her in bed getting ready to go to sleep. I lightly tickled her and she freaked. She turned sort of demonic looking and turned her head backwards. Not her body, just her head. I blacked out."

Sometimes I find the video on YouTube and other times I can never find it, and it's as if it was never made. When I catch the video of me being interviewed by Joe Rogan he keeps asking me questions about what happened between my older brother and his pregnant wife. I started to choke a little and I could feel the tears coming out of my eyes. Our house wasn't going to be big enough for me, my younger brother and sister, and my older brother and his pregnant wife. So they all decided that I should get kicked out. 

I was furious and angry and how dare they all kick me out and use my room for the baby that was to be born. I see myself on Joe Rogan podcast getting angry and then the video disappears. I feel normal again and a couple of days go by and I see that video again of me being on Joe Rogan podcast. I carry on my conversation and I describe how I got so angry that I got a gun out and wanted to trash the house. As I was shooting my gun inside the house one of the bullets hits my brother's wife, she died instantly. 

Then out of Joe rogans mouth and my mouth, the unborn child of my brother's wife peeks out and cries. I escape and run away and become homeless and this should have been another bad moment but being homeless was therapeutic. My roof was the atmosphere of earth, my showers were when the clouds gave out rain, my alarm clock was when the sun rose and the birds started singing. I found someone on the street who helped me get a new identity but I had to work for him in his shop, and so I did. I was telling Joe Rogan all of this and the video then disappeared. 

When it appeared again I carried on the story and told Joe Rogan how I managed to rebuild my life with a new identity. I got married to a woman and had a child with her and even got a house. Joe Rogan smiled at me and my brother's wife unborn baby, came out of his mouth to smile at me as well. One day I contacted my brother and told him where I lived and then I took off all of the locks in my whole house. My wife asked me what I was doing and I told her because I murdered my brother's wife and unborn baby, he deserves to do the same to me and then we can reconnect.  

My wife and child were screaming and shouting and trying to fix the locks, while I just sat there eating cheese cake and could see my brother walking up with a gun. Can't find the video anymore."

No sound except for the rain splattering on my window. I arrived late evening and went to my new house. The door was open, I could smell alcohol. Cigarette butts all around. 

I sighed. Left my suitcases in the living room and went to take a shower. The bathroom was unkempt, condoms and shoe prints on the floor. I sighed again and made my way to the bedroom. A huge brown stain, size of a basketball, was on the mattress. I went close and smelt it. It smelt disgusting and rancid. I loved it. 

Finally, I went down to the kitchen to cook some instant noodles. But I was so tired that I thought of ordering takeaway. I opened the app, ordered Chinese and delivery was to be done in 10 mins. I set the table and was waiting for my dinner to arrive. 

 I must say, I like this new county. It feels like I never left home. The takeaway especially was so good. I might have found my new favourite restaurant. My only complaint would be not to send a delivery guy who wears a lot of perfume. You see, smell overwhelms the taste."

She had perfected her slight smile, the one which gave nothing away. She had seen him yelling, crying and laughing. And she had maintained her slight smile.



Not tonight, though. He wasn’t at home and she could be herself. “I wonder if he’s at Ron’s birthday party”, she thought to herself, as she poured herself some coffee. She had overheard him talking to someone about it on the phone. It was strange. She had always felt he hated Ron. Not that he had said anything, obviously. But you could pick up on a lot of things, if you just kept quiet, and observed, never letting go of the slight smile. And she had done that, for three years now.



“I better clean this up”, Eliza said to herself as she rinsed the cup and placed it exactly where it had been. Just then, there was a boom of thunder, and it rattled the window panes. Oh, how she loved thunder storms! It was as though the skies finally had a voice, after being so quiet for so long.



“One of these days, I’ll roar as well”, she promised herself and the thunder. Just then, she heard the sound of the key in the door. She put on her slight smile, and walked noiselessly, to stand with the rest of the mannequins."

His task it was the church to guard,

Night air caught with every breath,

Grip of cold as strong as death.

*

Gravestones topped with caps of white,

Muffled all sounds made that night,

Few souls stirred among the stones,

The man hummed, mindless of the tones.

*

Twas the night before Christmas,

And all through the yard,

Was the whisper of strangeness,

Soft light of the stars.

*

The man who dwelt there,

In two rooms by the church,

Stood broad like a bear,

And each leg like a birch.

*

He traced the same course e’ry night,

And found his way by lantern light,

His path worn just inside the fence,

From treading here, to, fore, and whence.

*

Most nights were long, lonely, looming,

This night witnessed full moon blooming,

Diffuse through clouds, not dim but glowing,

Twenty eight days it had been growing.

*

Blue flashes through the swirling white,

An awesome beauty, fearsome night,

Bleakest beauty, brightest moon,

Spelled nature’s twisted perfect doom.

*

The churchyard stretches, long and vast,

In the fore the few trees stood as masts,

In the back though, deeper in the yard,

Woods stood, older, denser, scarred.

*

Lantern light amongst the stones,

Each a life, reduced to bones,

Deeper in the yard the wind,

Hushed its deafening din.

*

The trees among the stones were havens,

For woodland creatures, unkindness of ravens,

Sleeping at the witching hour, beaks in wings,

Pines guarding ‘gainst what winter brings.

*

From further in, within the trees,

Steps were carried on the breeze,

He stopped at once and bent his knees,

This night had put him ill at ease.

*

His face eases; his shoulders slump,

A figure emerges, round and plump,

Familiar furs, all red and white,

Of course, this Eve is Santa’s night.

*

A few steps, a show of greeting,

His relaxation, though, was fleeting,

Clouds parted, then, moon shown through,

Its face was bright, his horror grew.

*

A merry werewolf in Santa’s clothing,

Sprays of crimson over white were showing,

In a moment, in the dark of morning,

The man’s soul was adjourning."

Today was no exception. No one seem to bother talking with me. Everybody gave the cold shoulder. At first, it was rather disappointing and after some getting used to being alone, I just went about my own way, doing my best and not thinking too much.

Although the most annoying thing that I had to savor was that my colleagues tend to slam the door after I open, and luckily I was quick to enter wherever I wanted to. If not, my face would likely be pillared with the door like a flat pancake. 

Back at the dormitory, my fellows would just play a few rounds of Black Jack. Despite being the most unlucky person ever, there was a weird phenomenon that would occur. Whoever sat near me would literally absorb my luck, winning the rounds in an abnormal way where his cards would mirror mine. With the same numbers or pictured cards although with different shapes. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the sessions and won't be one to complain. 

Days go by and winter approached. I must had adapted to the cold weather, since I did not feel cold as I was used to last year when I first stayed here. In fact, I felt rather warm. My dormitory buddies gave me more attention. When I mischievously threw snowballs at them, they would always rage and were eager to find the culprit. I just simply look at the sides, admiring the beautiful snow. There was a time where I pushed my buddy down the lake. Indeed I got to admit that was a little too much. He ended up having a fever, and I felt really bad about it.

The best moment was where I built a snow man, and everyone would be jovial and commending my work. As always I just acted ignorant and did not admit it was my doing since I did not want to be standing in the light. I was used to being alone.

Eventually, the dormitory would have to undergo renovations and everyone had to move to another dormitory since the building was rather old at this point. On the last night, we sat around the table to chat. Everything was fine, with sweet and bitter chatter all over the room. It was only when I heard it.. and I froze. ""How I miss Miles. He was always the guy who cheered us up, and he was the reason why we are here still today. If not for him bringing us out of the burning building, he could have escaped long ago and not be trapped under the rubble. Today we leave this place and I hope he had moved on to a good place."" There was a somber atmosphere all around.

The realization shook me. It was not meant to be. All the hopes, dreams of striking it rich, brotherhood, and whatever feelings was pointless to be bound to. It was time for me to go.."

Chloe has been the love of my life for the last few years and I can honestly imagine spending the rest of my life with her. She grew up in a home with very overbearing parents who controlled everything about her life. Because of this she has this hatred of people who interrupt her when she is talking. 

Her friend Emily was over for a visit and they were in the living room having a conversation. I rushed into the room and tried to ask a question. Chloe immediately started scolding me and cut me off everytime I tried to talk. She then spent a half hour reprimanding me while Emily sat there with a smirk on her face.

Eventually Chloe demanded to know what was so important that I needed to be be so inconsiderate. I got them to follow me into the kitchen and heard Chloe's scream of anguish as she saw Adam's lifeless body. I calmly explained that he had been having an allergic reaction and I had been trying to get his epipen from her."

“Back in my day,” Yarger muttered as we trudged through the gravel. “There weren’t any sectors, Stones, nothing.” The old man’s voice shook throughout the tunnel, echoing all around to come back to us as faint whispers. 

“We know,” Holfsman groaned. “The Earth was a bright, peaceful place, people saw sunshine all the time yada, yada, yada. We get it.”

Yarger stopped, holding up his lantern to peer into Holfsman’s blue eyes, the flame flickered faintly, but  the glow was strong enough to see the crumpled look on the old man’s face. “Peaceful,” he hummed, “I never said peaceful.”

“You’ve said something of the sort,” Holfsman snorted, wiping his nose on the back of his torn sleeve. 

“I’ve never said anything of the sort.”

“Yes, you have. Now come on, we don’t have the time to sit around and talk.”  Holfsman turned his back to the man and continued on walking into the darkness of the tunnel. 

“My day,” Yarger continued. “My day wasn’t a time you’d want to be alive in.” 

Holfsman carried on walking. 

“You see here, The Stone,” Yarger gestured around. “You’re kept safe from what goes on out there,”  he lifted his frail palm from his side and patted the rough walls of the tunnel.   

Somewhere in the distance, Holfsman growled but didn’t stop to come back to us. 

“Back in my day,” Yarger repeated, “you had to fight to live. Those damned Kreatures were everywhere, wasn’t a place you could go without stumbling across one, but they... they were easy to hide from.” He sniffed and scowled, the smell of sulfur in the air was becoming undoubtedly stronger. 

“It was their kin, they were the ones you had to watch out for.” A stream of blood came pouring out the old man’s nose, I moved to help him, but he waved away my hands. “They looked... they knew how to look just like us, hair, teeth, eyes, *everything*. You’d never know when one got into a group, that is, until you’d hear the sounds of tearing flesh and taste the smell of blood in the air all while in your tent, thinking, *knowing* that you're next.” 

His hands began to shake, the metal of the lantern began to clacker about loudly in his grasp, and the sounds of Holfsman footsteps came to an abrupt stop. 

“Yarger?” I whispered, ""Are you okay?”

The old man turned to me, his usually soft amber eyes now an unyielding shade of black. “You youngsters,” he chuckled, blood spraying from his mouth. “You really have it too easy these days,” he pointed a skeletal finger at my chest, still chuckling, still bleeding. “Don’t even notice when-” he stopped to cough, spewing blood across the gravel as he did so. “Don’t even notice when one of your own is gone.”

“Yarger?” 

He looked up at me, his eyes glimmering in pure amusement. “I don’t even know who that is,” he cackled, showing his teeth, which I could now see were nothing but bloodstained razors. I felt my blood run cold, my lips trembled as I fought to keep in the scream harbouring in my chest. 

The flesh on his face began to slowly split apart,  revealing layers of rotten grey flesh. I took a step back as ~~the old man~~, the *thing,* advanced towards me. He chuckled a final time before dropping the lantern,  I heard the harsh shattering of glass and the scream of silence that followed darkness. Somewhere in the distance, I heard Holfsman scream “RUN!”, but it was too late, at that moment,  the thing pounced.

Sharp claws found their way into my flesh and razor-sharp teeth ripped away at my face. The only sound filling my ears was being made by me, as I gargled my own blood."

Co-opting motor control, it first tried to drive him to a precipitous drop, as was its favorite method of host termination. But the area around the human was flat, the terrain disappointingly level for miles. Failing to find a height from which to fatally throw the body, it sought to instead force the human to strangle himself; but found that some base instinct, beyond its control, prevented this particular method of suicide. Panicking, knowing it had only moments before the human’s psyche reasserted itself, it began its final attempt on the human’s life—an attempt of persuasion. 

""Why do *you* need this body? What have you done with it that would merit your continued existence? What purpose drives you?""

The human’s mind stirred, having been unceremoniously supplanted by the alien intelligence. A repetition of the series of questions brought the human cognizance to the forefront of conversation, and in response, the human intellect asked: “Who are you? What’s happening?” 

Lacking patience, the alien-mind sent images to its argumentative opponent, in which were contained the many histories and triumphs of its parasitic existence. Sights, sounds, and impressions of incomputable death were transmitted to the human intellect; the fall of kingdoms, the extinction of races; mass suicides, and the subsequent necromantic upheavals orchestrated by the malignantly parasitic species, who could *only* inhabit corpses: the necrocytic race. 

The human cried out within the abstract confines of the shared mind-space, unable to tolerate the appalling imagery. Psychologically repulsed, the human-mind demanded the departure of the alien-mind, but the latter was not about to follow the demands of the former. It **needed** the host's body.  

With practiced calmness, it began its argument, imploring the human to consider taking its own life, so as to finally end the pain, worry, and ceaselessly tiring nature of human existence. It argued, with an alleged sapience beyond that of man, that the middling intelligence possessed by humans would eventually lead to the ruination of the species; that mankind, not smart enough to ascend to higher echelons of being, but also not dumb enough to live in primal bliss, was doomed to fall into a darkly nihilistic and depressive state. It stated to have seen this inevitable outcome thousands of times, such as with the entirely female—and gigantically proportioned—race of the planet *M*a*um’mi.* 

The human—who'd been somberly trekking through the desert—listened attentively, and perhaps would’ve heeded the alien’s baleful prophecy, had the cephalically invasive entity not mentioned one thing: the race of towering xeno-women. This idea, that there existed an all-female race of Titans, served to powerfully refute the alien’s almost incantatory argument.

Emboldened by its desire to *interact* with this assuredly buxom race—or one like it—the human forcibly ejected the alien consciousness from its mental construct, and the physical form of the parasite fell lifelessly from the cranial hole through which it had entered. "

Nobody suspected anything because nobody knew him. Everyone hated him. Including me. So I relieved him of his mortal burdens. I am the light that came to gift him the sweet release of death. 

I put him in my attic. After a while his body began to smell so I stopped inviting people over to my house. 

Just last week I noticed the smell was gone so I went to check on the body. It was gone. Since then, I’ve noticed scratching in my walls and it won’t go away. Whenever I’m about to sleep, the scratching is so intense and so loud that it hurts my ears and leaves me with headaches for hours. Strangely enough, I like it. 

In the last 2 days, someone else is in my house. Doors are opening on their own, and I hear things shifting from other rooms. Yesterday afternoon a glass that I had stuffed in the back of the cupboard was shattered across the kitchen floor all on its own. 

Today, the thing I killed visited me. When I came into my room to go to sleep, he was standing there with his face rotting, looking at me with a piercing smile. A chunk of his forehead fell off of him and landed in my bedsheets. He said with what flesh he had left, “Why did you do this to me?” I told him why, and he said “Now I have to stay with you forever.”

So now I live with him. He haunts me in my house and I feel myself becoming him. I am connected to him. My flesh is his flesh. 

Today I am walking to work, cutting through the park when a man catches up to me from behind, drags me into the bushes, and stabs me to death. He leaves me there, but he doesn’t know that I’ll be visiting him soon."

My ascent via rocket travel was 6 months ago, and already I have begun to take to this lifestyle. The constant need to address a new issue or to unravel new mysteries with experiments in new conditions was all I ever wanted from life. A chance to help people; the people down there, on Earth. I could see the bright lights of great cities every now and again. When the light of the sun was fleeting across the surface, lights that flicked into existence were like the stars they would see from down there. I wonder how the world is doing. Day-to-Day occurrences and tragedies along with political happenings were rarely of consequence when you're thousands of miles above the surface of the planet. Everything seemed so small. So insignificant. At least to me. The others had families, friends, obligations. I just had my work, but I knew it would benefit all. Maybe not now, but the future would need what I'm doing up here someday. That's what I thought. We never saw it coming. Well, we did, but not until after it was visible to the naked eye in our station. Despite the years of exposure to the conditions, they stumbled over each other to get to the life-pods. I hadn't been there for more than a week but I made it first. I don't know why I did, but I closed the door and launched it. I saw the looks on their faces as I drifted away. Horror. Absolute, unrestrained, pure Horror. It crashed into the station moments later. It didn't even slow down despite the stations size and velocity. I went spinning. It felt like a lifetime, I never knew if I would fall to the surface or drift into the void. I did neither. I got to watch. It hit. Somewhere in North America. Ah, the ash cloud was fast to form. Must have been Yellowstone. The ash, that was the worst part. Because the little lights of the big cities had gotten covered up. The Blue Planet turned brown. There were, maybe, 3 days worth of rations in the pod. Just long enough for me to watch the Earth show me that all the stars on its surface would never flick on again."

Of course, there had been the common symptoms earlier--lethargy, fever, aches. Everyone got those to some extent.

The real side effects didn't set in for me until the morning of the second day. I spent most of the day prior on the couch, riding out the symptoms.  I felt recovered by breakfast the next day, if anything sharper and clearer than before.

As he sat across from me, he was going on as had become habit, how I was giving up a day to sickness, that the whole thing was no big deal for someone my age, why subject myself to a mass human experiment?  It violates medical ethics, to say nothing of politics.  And still nobody knew anything about long-term side effects.  You went and let big pharma rewrite your DNA without a second thought.

As he began, again, inevitably, to compare it to Tuskegee, his words devolved into a kind of variable hum, though I still got the gist.  I saw, for the first time, the lights inside his brain and knew intuitively what each one did and what it was for and how to turn it to a different use.

I reached out with a not-hand I'd never had before and shifted a pulsing ochre spot to a steady deep and mellow blue, like the light down at the bottom of the ocean.  I knew in that moment how it looked, the precise shade, though I'd never been.

The hum faded out, but I could tell by the dancing lights on either side that inside his head, he was still going on, still heard his noise, though outside, in my new world, all was peaceful.  I let him go on, admiring the way the lights played across the surface and in the depths of his brain, reading what he meant to say, though I'd taken his noise away.

I came to understand the darkest deepest light then.  I saw the fear at his core, how it drove the other lights, how they buzzed and blinked in time to it.  

I took it away then, drew it out and let it dissipate across his surface.  I filled the expanding hollow with my new-found light, glowing and steady.  I gave him peace, knowing he'd sit there silent, noiseless forever now.  I left the shell of him intact, ethereal where my light leaked through.  He'd keep that way, if I ever came back and wanted to see his lights again.

That done, I rose up into my new sky, passing through the ceiling without disturbance, arcing up to where I could see the lights of all the brains below, pulsing, vibrating, waiting for my not-touch.

Outside, I felt the others, my new brothers and sisters, rising with me.  I angled off, converging toward them.  I recalled the warning--something less than 1% of users may report unknown side effects.

But I felt fine."

I was only let in on the “family secret”, as it was called, around my eleventh year, but I knew before then that Alex was different. 


I played with her sometimes, in spite of the shit I got from the guys my age in the neighborhood. It was to see her face light up. Even though she could never express herself verbally, the dolls acted as her expression, and she made them twirl in place like ballerinas, made them glide across the back porch steps, made them bow in gratitude to invisible audiences.


When I was sixteen, she showed me her secret.


Our parents were gone for the evening, leaving me in charge. Alex and I stayed outside, on the back porch, as the sun sunk low beneath the mountains. The world was suddenly very dark, and the nocturnal sounds of bugs chattering and frogs croaking began not long after. And then her dolls began to dance. They twirled, glided, bowed as before, but she wasn’t moving them with her hands. She just sat and stared.


I was transfixed by their graceful movements. I don’t know how long we stayed out there, watching them. Then there was a noise, and I heard our mom say, “Oh, my God.”


In the same hushed whispers that our parents spoke of Alex’s condition, I overheard them the next day, speaking softly, fearfully, of witchcraft.


And Alex was sent away.


I visited her often as I could, but eventually our parents found me out. When I continued sneaking away, they locked me in my bedroom. They could be cruel, see.


At night I began to see them. Paper dolls.


They seemed to crawl up from between the floorboards, from the cracks in the walls. They whispered to me, and even though they weren’t the same as Alex’s dolls, they reminded me of her. So I listened.


They told me what to do to them, and I did it. I’ve been hiding in the woods outside of town for so long now that I might as well not even exist to most people. The paper dolls still speak in their lyrical tongue, and I still listen. But I don’t follow through, because I don’t need more trouble.


Sometimes I miss her, but I never miss our parents.


And sometimes, on summer evenings, I lay down with their voices in my ear and Alexandra in my head, and I dream of her still, there in the silence, there in the dark."

Eternity seemed so appealing.

For a young man with nothing to my name, the opportunity was everything. To live forever, never aging, never advancing from my peak physical state? Over a long enough timeline, I could finally be something.

So I went looking. I followed hunches, I knocked on doors, I kept my nose to the ground and checked on every rumor I could find. Missing bodies here, urban legends there. Eventually, it led me to him. A real-life vampire.

“I want what you have,” I begged him. “Make me what you are.”

He was hesitant at first. What to me seemed a gift was to him a condemnation. But there’s only so much desperation a man can see before he has pity. Eventually, he gave in.

“The beginning will be rough,” he told me. “As your body changes, you’ll feel more ill than you’ve ever felt. Eventually, the new cravings will settle in. Your body can’t consume normal food, so you’ll have to get creative. Don’t draw attention to yourself, don’t get staked through the heart, and whatever you do, do *not* stand in direct sunlight. Don’t forget: You’re here forever.”

The beginning was utter agony. But eventually I adapted. I felt better, stronger than ever before. Years turned to decades, decades to centuries, and I didn’t change a bit. I moved around a lot, generated the kind of wealth you only can in the long run. Life was just a serious of flings and conquests, blowing time and money on anything that could fill eternity.

And then I met her.

We hit things off right away. We were inseparable. She was my everything, the love of my endless life. I’d seen the entire world, and I could tell you that she was the best thing in it. It was a rocky conversation, but she didn’t mind what I was, the hurdles we’d have to jump to be together. She loved me for me. For the first time in my life, I felt truly content.

But time marches on. We moved in together. We got married. We lived a happy life. And she did what all humans do: She grew old. In what felt like seconds, she was gone. I’d finally found something worth truly living for, and she was gone.

Years ago, I’d resolved that this was it. I didn’t want to live in a world without the love of my life. Ironically, eternity seems only suited to those with nothing to live for. And that just wasn’t me anymore.

For the first time in ages, I sat on the roof and watched the sun rise. I wasn’t afraid of what was coming. I was content. I had faith I’d be with my love again. I was doing it for her.

Then I remembered those words I heard centuries ago:

“Don’t forget: You’re here *forever*.”

As I blow across the street we once called home, every particle of my being has but one feeling: Pain. Eternal pain."

I don’t have to worry about being a stinky grown-up. I can ride my bike down in the wind. I can eat candy any day I like. I can play my video games every day. I can go on adventures and have tons of fun!

But I turned ten today. The big 1-0. The double digits. Another step to growing up.

I stare out of my window at the bronze sky, the pink and orange clouds rolling inwards. My bike is leaning against the treehouse, casting long shadows into the grass. The party is long over, the tablecloth flapping in the breeze, the balloons flying in the breeze. Candy wrappers are scattered everywhere.

My face is as long as the shadows. Growing up sucks.

But luckily, there is a way. A way to never grow up, to be a kid forever. 

All you need is a baby.

Luckily there is one in my house. My baby sister Angel is sitting on her high chair, her arms waving like she is conducting an orchestra. Brown stains her onesie and she is sucking on a pacifier.

She giggles when she sees me. I have always been a good big brother to her. Always spending time with her, playing with her, tickling her.

After all, a happy baby is a happy meal.

I creep up behind her and push her head down, exposing the neck. Then I bite down and drink.

Blood tastes like apple juice.

Angel’s wails echo around the house, and she flaps her arms even more as tears stream down her face. Then her jaws go slack, her eyes turn pale and empty, and she crumbles into a pile of black dust.

Meanwhile, my baby teeth grow back in, replacing my adult ones. My eyes grow bigger, brighter, and shine with youth. Strength gushes through me like a river; and I glow with happiness.

I’m still giggling and twirling and laughing that I’m 6 again when Mummy comes down the stairs. Her face is pale; her hair is turning gray. There’s a bump the size of a watermelon in her belly.

Mummy gives me a tired smile.

“Alex,” she whimpers. “Please, have mercy… I can’t live like this...”

I snap my head towards her. “Would you like me to call Daddy?”

Mummy begins to shake. Snot and tears run down her cheeks.

“No...please…”

I grin, knowing I hold all the cards. “Good. Make sure that the baby is healthy. It will be some time before I feed again. And you can clean my room while you’re at it.”

“Yes, Alex…”

As my pitiful, no-good Mummy scampers away, I stride outside, staring at the bright, full moon that shines down upon me. I have 4 more years of childhood to look forward to. 4 more years of fun and adventure and laughter.

And as long as I continue to feed and relieve my childhood over and over, those 4 years will be forever."

It’s not even *just* the quality. It's legacy, a status. It’s the invitation to a secret club, members only. You see each other on the street, wearing Prada or Gucci or Versace, and you lock eyes, and you nod, because you both *know*. You’re in a different class, you’re a cut above the trudging masses.

Of course, it’s not easy to buy designer on a budget. But that’s why consignment stores exist.

I’m on all the online shops—you have to be if you want to snatch up a deal. Most people have a *type.* For some, it’s handbags. For others, it’s watches. My weakness? Shoes. And when I saw those red stilettos from SAN GUIN, I *had* to have them.

God, they were gorgeous! I practically squealed when I found the package waiting for me—genuine SAN GUIN heels, can you believe it? Supposedly, they only make 100 pairs a year, and here I was, lucky enough to get my hands on one that was practically like new—and at a price that was downright *sinful*! If I didn’t do so much research into the consignment boutiques I frequent, I’d be worried they were counterfeit.

Well, they fit great—not exactly comfortable, but what’s beauty without pain? I modeled them with a few choice outfits and promised myself I’d find an excuse to wear them over the weekend.

As I was slipping them from my feet, I felt a sharp prick on my finger. 

“Ow!”

Carefully setting down my new favorite shoes, I took a look at my hand. My finger was bleeding—quite profusely. Wincing, I rinsed it, revealing a neat, deep slice. For a moment, I stared. What could've caused it?

Well, accidents happen. I dried my hand and applied a bandage, then went downstairs to eat dinner.

As I munched my salad, I browsed the internet. I like to find the exact item I bought so I could see what it was worth brand-new. The funny thing was, I hadn’t been able to find this pair of shoes in SAN GUIN’s catalog. In fact, it didn’t look like SAN GUIN sold *any* red shoes.

Maybe they were just a special addition.

I dug deeper into the Google search, scrolling to find an answer.

And I did.

It turns out, SAN GUIN only ever made *one* pair of stilettos. They were white. I found this tidbit in an article about their owner—who’d killed herself, bleeding out in the bathtub.

Suddenly, a sound drew my attention to the ceiling. A slow, deliberate tapping, like someone walking across the room above.

Someone walking in thin, stiletto heels."

I shoulda known he was a serial killer. A well-adjusted, good-looking guy who used soap, had all of his own teeth, and was *actually* interested in me?

Of course it was too good to be fucking true…

So here was the rub: I was trapped in a cramped room with eight zombies—four male, three female, one too decomposed to tell—and it was gonna a loooonnnnggg time before anybody came looking for me.

Oh sure, I’d told my friends and families where I was going, but since the outbreak, the police had been overwhelmed. Although we’d clawed back some semblance of a functional society, a missing person case would be low on their priorities list. Containing the outbreak was a HUGE resource drain, which meant the major cities got a little…Mad Maxy.

Serial killers popped up all over the place. Psychiatrists even had an explanation for the phenomena, something about a trauma response to the end of the world?

And now I’d gone home with one of the lunatics. Fan-fucking-tastic. This was marginally worse than my dinner date with Jerry.

Luckily, as everyone knows, zombies are a MASSIVELY shit way to kill someone. Oh sure, in the early days they were a threat, but now they had rigor mortis and crumbling limbs and the hand-eye coordination of a baby swallow.

I estimated the room to be roughly twenty square feet. It would probably take the zombies an hour to make it from one end to the other.

But I guess that was part of the appeal, right? My death would be an agonizing, drawn-out affair. From behind a thick sheet of glass, my tormentor could watch my gradual descent into madness.

I lay down in the corner and rested my eyes. When I opened them again, the zombies were halfway towards me. I stared at the ceiling until they were almost close enough to take a bite, then sidestepped them, steering well-clear of their mouths, which snapped open and shut. Then, I curled up against the opposite wall.

It wouldn’t be *too* difficult to stay alive. Eventually, *somebody* would come find me. And for a moment, I let myself believe things would be okay.

But then my captor appeared behind the glass and tapped a button in the wall.

His voice came out of a speaker in the ceiling. “Congrat! You’ve survived a full hour. I’m impressed.”

“Only an hour?” I replied. “Shit, I could do this all day.”

He smiled. “Really?”

“Really.” I dusted my shoulder. “It’s a walk in the park.”

He grinned. “Well in that case, let’s up the ante.”

He pressed a button, and then an alarm blared. A moment later, the walls began to tremble, then they slid inward. Now the room wasn’t twenty by twenty—it was nineteen by nineteen.

My captor smiled. “See you in another hour.”"
quqy2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/quqy2n/bullet_time/,Bullet time,155,0,1637011773.0,"I have a confession to make. My ""accident"" didn't make me any faster, my true power was to slow down time as much as I want. I slowed time by about 50% whenever I was in a fist fight, and about 70% whenever it got really dangerous so I could avoid the hits. I became a legend in my gang, and I was quickly promoted to capo within eight months.

Dodging and weaving like a magical fucking maniac, I took out my enemies like it was nothing. True, a bullet would kill me; as I said, I wasn't invincible nor was I faster than anyone. I simply slowed time so that I always knew before they even lifted their guns to aim at me. Sound was low and roaring in bullet time, but I long since learned how to decipher the cocking of a gun, the deep thud of a footstep.

Whenever I wasn't working, I was always practicing my switching. Turning it on and off was easy. I just had to will it. Speed of thought, y'know? My first brawl I slowed time to a standstill, trying to figure out what was going on. Ever since the doctor put that metal plate in my head after I got shot, I'd never lost another fight. I was unstoppable.

Of course I learned the hard way that bullet time didn't make me invincible. The first few fights, I quickly realized that no matter how slow time ran for me, catching a bat from behind still hurt. It took a little longer for my body to register the pain, but I felt it for weeks after.

So for a year, I was the terror of the city, my streets were peaceful because with an enforcer like me, there was nothing anybody could do to us. I once took out an entire squad before they'd even fired their guns. A bullet each to the head from 20 paces. Well, times were good then. The Don was going to make me his right hand man by the end of the year.

Then Christmas came. They hit us when we were totally off guard. I should have known some of the other capo's were jealous, but they hid it pretty well. I thought I saw Nicky Two-Toes bringing in the boxes of champagne and I did wonder why that goon was doin' something so menial, but after the girls jumped out of the cakes, we were all so jazzed we didn't know what hit us.

I slowed down time just as the hall blew up. I went to 99% in a panic. The blast had ripped apart the gorgeous young lady to my right. I stopped time right as the pieces of shrapnel dug into my eye. Fuck.

I don't know how long it's been like this. I can't even remember the details anymore. Time. I'm afraid to let it go. But I'm even more afraid of what would happen to me if I don't."

*I only hope you are still you.*

*I am no longer in existence because mine I did not provide. Perhaps out of guilt. Perhaps…*

My name was Herbert R.

In 2019, I was a specialist-consultant with the World Health Organization, an employee of the National Security Agency, and a high-ranking officer of an organization called FADE, an ostensible pro-environment NGO whose actual purpose was the suppression and manipulation of information related to climate catastrophe—*inevitable* climate catastrophe, although that was precisely what we were tasked with denying.

You must understand this: I knew humanity was doomed.

By our own actions, by inaction.

FADE was merely a means of controlling our species-death without causing panic.

That knowledge was a burden I carried with me every day.

Then I saw *Lightbeast*.

He appeared to me out of the sky—a fallen star become an avatar, a speaker for an interstellar alien race specialising in the collection and restoration of dying planets, ""antique worlds.""

He made me an offer:

In exchange for the peaceful transition of Earth into alien hands, salvation for humanity.

It was not my decision to make, I told him, but he seemed not to understand the concept. ""Are you not human?"" he asked. 

""I am,"" I said.

""Thus the decision is rightfully yours.""

His terms were cruelly simple. Because humans were the cause of Earth's destruction, the only way to preserve Earth was to destroy humanity.

""We could eliminate you through war,"" *Lightbeast* said, sensing my consternation, ""but that would be inefficient for us and horrific for you.""

And so, I agreed.

I betrayed my species—to become its saviour.

The proposed method of annihilation-salvation was deceptively simple, mass DNA collection followed by species-wide suicide.

""We will remake you elsewhere,"" *Lightbeast* said.

He left implementation to me.

My plan, developed feverishly but with genuine intentions, is undoubtedly well-known to you by now, so suffice it to say that through my contacts at the NSA, I acquired a virus—contagious and sufficiently dangerous to warrant global action—and released it in Wuhan, China.

I watched it spread.

When the virus became a worldwide health issue, I supported the creation of a vaccine, which was to be the lynchpin of my plan: a method by which to acquire systematically the genetic material of as much of humanity as possible, and—with *Lightbeast*'s intervention—the euthanising agent itself, so willingly, if unnowingly, taken.

I tried my best to expand the vaccine to as many as possible, working tirelessly to bypass trials and lower the age at which it could be administered.

But I could not save them all.

For that, I am sorry.

*Lightbeast* promised me the residuals would be eliminated humanely.

As for the endtime itself, it was engineered to take effect on time-delay, simultaneously for all, in our final Earth year, 2022.

*But I could not wait.*

*Bless me.*

*Forgive me, please.*

*God could not help us, so it was I who tried.*

I’ve been doing this long enough that I can sense its presence, as surely as it can smell mine.

The people in the nearby village contacted me when bodies began to pile up, first livestock then human. Each had been veritably torn to shreds, but the marks tell me enough to know what I’m up against: a werebeast. I managed to track it to these woods, and deep gouges in some of the trunks tell me I’m in the right place.

A rustle to my left catches my attention, and I drop to the side as a hulking figure soars over me with more grace than it should be able to manage. It hits the ground and skids to a stop, snarling. I note the ridge along the back of its neck: a male then.

Yes, a male. I have to think of them in such terms. Detached. Cold. It’s the only way to do what I must, to not think about what’s left after the silver pierces their heart and they transform back into a neighbor, a mother… a child. I have to remind myself, they know not what they do but it is too late. They cannot be allowed to continue hurting others.

The wolf begins to circle me, and I in turn rotate to keep it in my sights. I keep my eyes on its feet, looking for any indication that it will deviate from its path and start toward me.

It’s almost imperceptible, but after a few orbits I realize the beast has not been keeping distance but rather moving on an inward trajectory, closing in on me bit by bit. This is a tactic I’ve not seen before...

I take a step back and with horrible luck my foot hits a patch of rotting undergrowth. I stumble, and in an instant it is on me. I hit the ground hard and the blade clatters from my fingertips. Which is okay, as my arm is already up, pressed at its throat to keep it from mine.

Suddenly the onslaught stops. It stops snapping its jaws, the snarling drops to a heavy, ragged breath. A trail of drool drops down onto the ground by my head as its mouth curves upward. It looks down at me, and for the first time I get a good look into its eyes. What I see there stills my heart.

I begin to struggle, trying to pull myself from under its weight, but it’s no use. It has me pinned, and it is simply sitting on me, staring. Behind the look of pure triumph, deep inside, lies a cold sliver of humanity. The man inside is aware, awake. And he relishes what he is about to do."

I wanted to change myself and I was so determined and I didn't care who laughed at me or anyone else who didn't think that I could do it. I went up to the families of every person I had killed and they supported me thoroughly and were very encouraging. I really meant it when I promised myself that I was going to stop killing people and I wanted a different kind of life. 

The only positive thing I got out of killing is that I had become extremely good at cleaning up, because cleaning up blood and human matter isn't as easy as one thinks. I have also attributed to the cleaning of environment by reducing population and burying bodies down in the soil without any coffin. The environment could feed on the decomposing bodies. Like I said though I wanted to stop killing altogether and I had so much support from my community and they were going to miss me being the local killer. 

I didn't want to be the local killer anymore I wanted to be a productive member of society and even the police officers were backing me up and encouraging me to turn my life around and not kill anymore. It was super hard especially at night time when I saw someone who I knew that I could have easily killed. Even potential victims turned around to look at me and they encouragingly ""you can kill me but how disappointing will you be with yourself"" and those words hit me like a rock. 

Then there were things like knives and ropes which I had used to kill and now I must use them for not killing, but for productive uses. My house definitely feels nicer and smells nicer and I am so grateful for all of the support I had received ever since I stopped killing. Because it's been a year since I decided to stop killing all of my victims families, potential victims and police officers are going to throw me a well done party."

Samira smiled bitterly at the text. Another long lonely Saturday evening for her. There was no point in refusing- even if she had the heart to refuse her boy anything, he would probably just sneak off anyway. 

*-Ok picking u up 11:30 no drinking drugs!*

*-Thanks mom luv u*

*-I love u too*

Her last text remained unread. She thought about watching or eating something. The simple fact was she hated being alone in the evenings - old fearful paranoias flooded back to her, the pipes and walls creaked louder, and she became uneasy, restless. 

Tonight, the creaking was louder than ever. Samira found herself staring at the wall, which appeared to start shaking. An earthquake? Her imaginary fears gave way to sharp stabbing pangs of real horror as the walls of her living room seemed to shimmer and open up, a long skinny elegantly-clad leg stepped out, and in a split second, a man with a Cheshire cat smile and blank eyes stood before her. 

“Hello Samira”. The wall stopped heaving. “I’ve come to take you.” 

Samira stared at him, speechless. 

“Come along my dear. It won’t be as bad as you fear.”

She found her tongue. “No!” she gasped. “Please. I have to be here- for my son. I’m all he has- he’s only sixteen. I have to care for him!”

“Oh you silly woman. Why do you think I’m here?”

She refused to believe. 

“Sad but true my dear. He sold your soul for a party invite. Anyway, don’t worry. Lily here will take of him.” He snapped his fingers, and a woman with a demon face flickered into sight. “Lily you stupid cunt, your face!”  Lily flickered again, and Samira found herself staring at her lookalike. “See? Lily can take perfect care of him.” Lily-Samira grinned, showing sharp glowing white teeth. 

“No”, sobbed Samira- “Let me make a deal with you! A better deal! Tell me what you’d like”.

His Cheshire smile grew even wider. “Oh my goodness, how delicious. Let me see. Actually I know exactly what I want. You realise the sad truth- even in hell, men are valued more, especially the soul of a fresh young man. The potential, you know, for evil. And especially compared to that of a tired old hag, if you’ll pardon me for pointing out the obvious, such as yourself. So, his soul for yours?”

“She- she will leave?”

He threw his head back and roared with laughter. “Lily you are so unwanted, my poor bitch!” He snapped his fingers and Samira’s doppelganger vanished. “There. No Lily. Just you and your precious son- but his soul is mine.”

Samira nodded. 

“Excellent my dear! Well, I’ll leave you to enjoy the rest of your Saturday evening- I heard my presence is requested at Bailey’s place”

He turned and stepped back into the shimmering wall. Samira was alone. Her phone began ringing in twenty minutes."

As part of the game, I deliberately paused and faced my boss. 

He watched on at the squirming man beneath my grip, pretending to consider his pleas.

The pause allowed them to believe, to hope, before it was all taken away. It was my favourite part. I even prolonged it with a gentle whisper of;

“…Boss?”

And, finally, he said with a cold brutality;

“Do it.”

And I obliged, bringing the blade down in a quick slam that separated the mans hand from his arm at the wrist. The now stump exploded instantly, squirting blood like a fountain as my bosses former business partner screamed in terror and pain before collapsing and writhing.

The message had been sent and, my part done, I walked away.

Amputation as a form of punishment was outlawed twenty years ago and though many were punished for what was considered a “barbaric act”, due to my connections and the fact that my identity was unknown, I was never caught and certainly never punished.

To… remember the good times, I sometimes watched the documentaries of those who had survived amputation punishment. Those who wept as they discussed a life without a limb or two, and the “monsters” who had held them down as something was taken away from them forever.

I cried also, but only because I missed it so much.

Sometimes whilst amongst family my mind would wander as I recalled the good times. I even tried to replicate the feeling as much as possible, but it was never the same. 

Nothing could compare to the feeling of the initial separation of skin. The feel of a thick bone, normally so tough, separating like warm butter. The sound of the screams that didn’t haunt me but soothed me.

&#x200B;

It was in the middle of the night that my bedsheets were removed.

I groaned, cursing at my wife, only to realise with sudden fear that she wasn’t by my side. She’d gone to her sisters for the week.

I was home alone.

I bolted up, figuring it was some of my victims out for revenge, but with a slam I was forced downwards and onto my back.

Adrenalin flooded through me and I protested loudly, but it was strange. I was being held down on every inch of my body, but I couldn’t… *see* anyone.

I demanded to know who they were, for them to show themselves rather than hiding in the dark, but nobody replied nor came to view.

Until, the large meat cleaver- one I recognised instantly from my glory days- appeared to float into the room.

Panic filled me, for I understood, but that wasn’t enough.

They wanted me to *know*.

And as the light switch was flicked twice, it revealed the truth for a half second as my pained eyes adjusted to the sudden illumination.

Thousands of severed hands, their fingers wiggling, held me perfectly still as the blade was brought down on my neck."

He always has a huge smile on his face and everyone he meets instantly takes a liking to him.

Mark is friends with all of the neighbouring children and our house is usually filled with laughter and the sound of children's voices. He is always coming up with new games to keep all of his friends amused. His friends are usually amazed at the games he comes up with and are overjoyed at how much they have playing with him. 

Most of the neighbouring parents are always commenting on how Mark is one of the most amazing children they have met. They cannot believe how often he comes up with ideas for new games or how much effort he puts into them

This morning he woke up and wanted to go outside and play but I wouldn't let him as there was thunder and lightning forecast for the day. He just shrugged and ran off to find something to play. 

I was sitting on the couch with my husband watching TV, and I could see Mark jumping from one piece of furniture to the next. I thought nothing of it when he fell onto the floor as it was only a small distance.

I almost jumped out of my skin when his scream of anguish started. We both jumped out of our chairs and ran to see if he was okay. I stood there in shock while staring down at his body. There was steam rising from him and his entire body had become blackened and burnt.

Mark just lay there screaming in agony and my husband tried to lift him but he quickly moved his heads away with scorch marks on his arms. Mark just gazed at us his with pain in his eyes and muttered ""the floor is lava"" before releasing one last agonised breath"

That’s all the note said, typed on a typewriter by the look of it, and pasted onto a correspondence card. I found it underneath my door and since then, my mind has circled around those five words. 

I pondered the meaning as I rode the elevator to the laundry in the basement. Mr. Perkins from 407 was doing a load alone as I entered, folding a pile of frayed-collar Oxford shirts. He was in his eighties, frail but dutiful. His smile seemed a reflexive courtesy though, never reaching his eyes. 

“Hey Mr. Perkins. How’s the good fight going? Eleanor home yet?”

He sighed. “She…won’t be coming back.”

Eleanor was a hound mix, a sweet, aging dog that Diane, our neighbor in the unit between us, despised. Dogs weren’t allowed in the building, and Diane had made it her mission to make that rule known. I tried to help Mr. Perkins hide Eleanor—lied for him, showed him a DIY podcasting website where he could buy soundproofing foam. In the end though, Diane still found out. 

“What happened?” 

His eyes watered. “She was old. The kennel didn’t love her the way I did.”

I thought back to Mr. Perkins’ late wife. She had loved the dog too. Now he had lost them both. 

“Diane’s a cunt. Sorry, but…she is.”

“Yeah.” His smile grazed his eyes for a moment. “Her husband wrote the letter to the landlord, but she put the pen in his hand. You never truly know your neighbors. Some are bitter that your door opens into the same air as theirs.”

He pulled a load of clothes from the washer and heaved them into a dryer as I started a load of my own. Some of his clothes were stained, still dirty after the wash. Poor guy. 

“Well, if you need anything,” I offered, trying to mask pity behind cheer, “Diane could…have an accident or…find a burning bag of dog shit on her welcome mat.”

He seemed to almost laugh. “People like Diane toil in emptiness, but—.” He trailed off as he sometimes did, his long years manifesting a patina of cognitive decline. 

“Mr. Perkins, your keys.” He almost put them in the dryer, but caught himself. Then I heard him whisper. 

“*House, deadbolt, mailbox, desk, padlock on the crate*.”  It was quiet, a reminder to himself. I wouldn’t have remembered, except that three days later, Henry Perkins passed away. The police had gone to his door to investigate a missing person—Diane’s husband, Paul. They must’ve smelled decay, but inside of Mr. Perkins’ place, they found *two* bodies. Paul had been locked in Eleanor’s crate atop a pile of towels soaked in his own blood. Apparently, his screams had been muffled by soundproofing foam. 

*He will bleed in silence.* 

Mr. Perkins was old. He had gotten the doors confused, but he was right about one thing. As Diane cursed Mr. Perkins in the hall, I couldn’t help but smirk. 

You never truly know your neighbors."

Cold and hungry he was, he only wished for something to keep him warm and also a good meal for once. Hiding in a nearby cave, he drew. A jacket and a cookie jar to start his day off. He knew what would happen. The moment he turned his back, he grabbed the jacket and cookies from the jar.

Over the next few days, the boy drew a puppy, a companion that would accompany him through thick and thin. Eventually, he drew a car, house, and everything spice and nice one can think of. Becoming a famous painter, he held many art conventions which attracted many people around the world. He donated much of his fortune to philanthropy, making worldwide contributions. 

Some of his finest art include beautiful mountains and lakes which seem surreal. It was rumored that those mountains and lakes were discovered very soon after the painting were revealed. It was as if he was a miracle man, making reality happen with his art. Drawing medicine that would cure a disease, it was astounding as it sounded ridiculous, but it happened right in front of thousands of onlookers. However, not even the finest man could not overcome death.

As the retired painter was about to draw his final painting on his deathbed, he drew a painting which looks like a youth fountain, perhaps wishing for immortality and youth. But nothing happened. All he could hear was a faint screech. ""Your desire shall feed me....!"" 

As the old painter shut his eyes. He tears rolled out endless. After several seconds, his eyes opened and a sinister smile combed his lips. 

Meanwhile, a couple was hiking up the hills, wanting to take a look at the famous haunted waterfall. ""Look at the barrier!"" The young lady exclaimed. The man replied that he heard about a folklore from the local villagers that this cursed waterfall was the home of something dark that would entrap you for eternity in exchange of granting your desires with whatever you draw. All your wishes would be granted like you were in a paradise but you would be living in a fantasy being watched by the shadow till the end of time.

The lady wanted to take a picture before leaving. When the man was about to take a snapshot, the lady's face was turning pale. After seconds, her consciousness dissipated, falling backwards. The man reached out his hands to save his lover. Dropping the camera, the shot was taken from the impact on the floor. With it, an image appeared.

I entered the elevator and pressed the button for the second floor, and when i looked back the hooded man was running towards me, suddenly the lights on the building went off and after a few minutes when the lights went on again the hooded man had dissapeared from sight.

I believed that I was safe, that I had escaped the mysterious stalker.

Fixated on all the horror he’s seen.

Every night, it’s the same routine,

Reading new tales while drinking caffeine.

He reads and listens all alone in the dark,

With no pets around to yap and bark.

He scrolls along with bated breath,

Hearing tales of beasts and death.

From Reddit to YouTube, 4Chan, and more, 

He searches the web for horror galore.

Of all the things to be scared of most,

It’s creatures and monsters, not ghouls and ghosts.

They say he’s obsessed with the dark and twisted,

Glued to the screen, some might say addicted.

Tonight’s the night he’ll find new dread,

For the nightmares he seeks will visit him instead.

Pitch black inside his little room, 

It’s in the corner now that I loom.

Hearing my pen scratch the paper, he looks my way,

My eyes lock with his and its terror I display.

Before I write his story’s end,

He screams in agony at the flesh I rend. 

Now I’m off to find another poor soul,

That kinda stuff you know. Well one day we were speaking and he said he’d been feeling really burnt out, for his privacy il call him Dave. Anyways Dave decided to take a few weeks off and that was the last we saw off him for a while 

Until one day. I heard my son excitedly shout “Mommy Mommy! Dave is here!” I gave him about 5 dollars and said to be back in 10 minutes. My son ran out to talk to Dave as I started doing the dishes . I thought it was a bit weird. Normally Dave leans out the window and waves to me if I’m inside but this time he just stayed in the shadows of his truck. I ignored it and kept on washing the dishes. 15 minutes pass and I look out the window, I expect to see Dave and my son talking but I look outside and..

My child is gone. I couldn’t find him anywhere, I quickly called the police. Afterwards calling Dave. I hurriedly told him the situation 

“My son is gone I know you spoke to him!”

He stayed silent for a minute before saying “I didn’t come round today”

The police arrived as I ran out and begged them to help. I was sent to station and was later told they couldn’t find my son anywhere."
qubekc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qubekc/a_confession_letter/,A Confession Letter,1253,36,1636963304.0,"  

I’m a detective, and these last seven years I’ve worked exclusively in homicide. In November of my first year, a news anchor from the local TV station had been murdered, and her naked body displayed in a popular park. Every November since, a prominent citizen of our little community has been murdered and similarly displayed in very public places.

I’ve been on the team working the case from the start, and though it pains me to admit, up to this moment we’d yet to come across a single clue as to whom the killer might be. After the second November the local paper dubbed the murderer the November Celebrity Killer, and then set about disparaging me and my colleagues over our inability to solve the case. Each successive year the criticisms have grown stronger and lasted longer, and each successive year my colleagues and I have grown more frustrated and bewildered over the fact that we‘d yet to uncover a single shred of evidence related to any of the killings—until today.

I just found the following letter addressed to our police station:

*To whomever, blah blah blah:*

*Not being one to bury the lead, I am the November Celebrity Killer.* *As proof, use the enclosed key to unlock safety deposit box 1616 at First National, where you will find a piece of personal property belonging to each of the six victims* (a key was included)*.*

*I have no explanation for having done what I’ve done, but the burden I feel from having taken these lives has increased to the point that I, ironically I suppose, can no longer sustain.* *You will find my seventh and eighth victims at the return address on this letter’s envelope.* *The eighth victim will be me, and the seventh will be my lovely wife, whom I intend to cross over with.*

*Go in Christ,*

*Reverend George Harrison*

I’ve heard people talk about their blood running cold—now I know what they meant. I heard the key in the front door—my husband returning from his errands, no doubt, one of which had been carrying the stack of mail from the foyer table to the post office—except for the one he’d accidentally dropped on the foyer floor. I was in the den—my service revolver was upstairs, locked away in my bedroom closet. The foot of the stairs was near the front door, the door my husband had just entered. My training kept trying to kick in, but my heart kept getting in the way . . ."

Mother told me to be careful because if I were to die my condition would only get worse. She said that she would become hideous with grief at my death and that she would waste away as well should I fully decay. She said that I wouldn't be free till my body was nothing but bones. I never quite understood that, but cryptic warnings were her specialty so I didn't question it at the time.

Even when I was alive, the condition had negative effects on me. My hands were always cold. My skin would flake off like snow. My colorless hair would fall out even when I kept it clean. I hated my condition, and it only got so much worse when I died. There was no moment of black calm followed by freeing realizations of newfound liberty. Even though I was no longer 'sick', I began to look sicker and sicker as the days went by.

Dark circles appeared around my eyes and grew like blooming flowers. My hair and nails grew for a time, before inevitably falling away. My once-perfect teeth turned gray and wobbly, and my ribs became visible even through my worn, dirty clothes. I didn't mind how hideous I was, as I was never very good-looking, to begin with. What I did mind was that I was lonely. I was not fit for living people outside my terrible family to even look at.

The dead were no better. I was bound to the earth by a body that was more burden than anything else. I was not capable of leaving, and those who still lingered here turned me away. I wasn't alive, I wasn't a ghost. I was nothing. I used to see dead children laughing and playing in the cemetery. Oh, how I envied those children, who were drowned, murdered, or choked to a proper death. Oh, how I wished I had died properly.

All the while Mother stayed as happy and beautiful as she was before I was born. I know that she never really cared for my health. I was like her little voodoo doll, destined to keep her pretty and youthful until my body was finally nothing but bones. This was why she didn't let me roughhouse with my brothers, why she didn't let me move out till I was twenty-three. She knew that my death meant a catalyst for her, the start of a years-long countdown until she finally lost her characteristic beauty.

That's why I'm so glad it's finally almost over. Thanks to a multitude of helpful critters, namely these adorable crows and some kind of mushroom, very much of my flesh have been picked or rotted away. In due time, the condition Mother gave me will wear out, and she'll be older and grayer and uglier than even me. Soon I'll know true freedom like those cemetery kids. Very soon indeed, my body will be nothing but bones."

Of her inmost part I'm the sole occupant, she my only bearer.
How such entanglement most intractable came to be
In the following passage you all shall soon see.

I for some two years or more pursued Dora so ardently,
By her window, by her floor, I'd pray and plea;
No song, no posey, no expenses or labour
Did I mitigate for Dora's sweet favour.
She did my fervour heed by civility, as all polite girls ought,
But she heeded not my longing, no carnal affection was my way brought.
One wintry night, in the month of December, I think it was,
When I found Dora at my threshold for an unknown cause.
The woman I longed for so long right by my door!
Upon greeting she began to speak in severe tone I've not heard before,
""Pardon my intrusion, sir, but I must talk to you, for the last time perhaps.
I beseech you to quit your courtship towards me lest you further lapse.""
To which I could but reply, ""Oh Miss, why?""
Casting a look of pity she answered with a sigh.
""Sir, may we converse inside, this being a matter awfully delicate?""
I consented, then led her to the room which seemed most private.
She spoke again, ""Sir, I shall never be yours, you shall never have me.
Why it is thus I cannot explain but you must accept this to ever be.""
Undeterred, I implored, ""No, I'll never stop, for naught else I desire.
If my suit proves without doubt impossible, I shall by my own hand expire.""
Resigned, yet angry, she seemed at my rebuttal.
""Sir, you give me no choice but to reveal the true cause of my refusal.""
She loosened top of her dress, revealed her left breast
Which she grasped and, to my terror, pulled the top off the rest.
Beneath, I saw a dark chamber where her heart should lay.
Inside was a small creature, black and red, who scowled in a horrid way.
""Fool! She can never be yours"", screamed he,
""She belongs to me and I to her as you can very well see!""
Without a thought I lunged and grabbed it like I would a prize;
Such grip I applied it crumbled into what seemed pieces of ice.
""Oh no, you've done the worst you could have done!"",
Cried Dora, such cry to curl my every bone.
""The long curse he and I had borne, now is thine.
That dark cavern in my chest shall hence thou confine!""

Thus, I, here in dear Theodore's interior, dwell 
Where she can no longer my presence repel.
""Curse"" she called it, but I am not so sure
For eternal place in her her heart I did procure."

""Doesn't anyone know how to not fucking stay silent?"", called out the masked man facetiously, while he caressed his rifle. Of course, nobody actually spoke, he just shot someone because he felt like it.

I tried my best not stand out, cry, whimper, scream, talk, whisper. Miss Willow already made that mistake; her cries were surprisingly loud for a frail, old lady, which clearly angered the shooter, as she now had plenty of bloody holes in her vibrant floral shirt. 

The man walked up and down the classroom, erratically swinging the gun, before landing on another student crouching in the very corner. 

""You,"" the man began, ""tell me one reason why you want to live."" Through profusive tears, the terrified girl responded.

""W-well, I---"" Before she could speak, the shooter pulled the trigger and shot her multiple times in the torso. Her body collapsing to the floor was met by gasps. 

""You're sick!"" shouted another student from the other side of the room, the dead girl's sister, I presume. 

The man, laughing to himself, sauntered towards the girl, who was probably now regretting her decision to open her mouth. I was bracing for the loud bang, but instead was greeted with a sickening crunch. 

Somehow, the shooter had broken her hand just by standing on it. His build was stocky, and it showed. The girl screamed, before being silenced. I couldn't suppress my urge to yelp, which caught the irascible man's attention.

He turned, his mask contorted, outlining the hidden anger on his face. His eyes, although I couldn't see them, were directly looking at me. 

""What is your name, boy?"" His voice was brooding. I couldn't find the words to respond. All I could manage was an exhale of stressed breath. I finally found the words. 

""I-I'm, u-uh,"" The man's fingers tightened around the trigger, ""My n-name is Blake,"" A sudden burst ofa confidence flushed over me, ""Why don't you show yourself?""

The man crouched down, admiring my bravery, but more so my stupidity. 

An eerie silence spread throughout the class, like someone hit the mute button on a remote. And to my surprise, the man agreed quite happily. He unveiled his mask, revealing his short stubble, his flat chin, his greasy hair, his brown eyes, his weirdly shaped teeth. 

W-what? 

It was my face. The man was me.

Since we don't have kids, and we do have a house out in the country, that ""fun"" can be all sorts of things.

Just in case somebody else's kids are reading this, I'll leave out some details. It's like Halloween, except any day of the year. We dress up in costumes (or not) and play Let's Pretend. Good clean fun.

Today Tammy is the county sheriff, and I'm a bad, bad criminal. She's got me dead to rights, handcuffed and hog-tied. Flat on my back, in the grass, in my tighty whities, I'm as vulnerable as a man can be. And a half mile from our nearest neighbor, Sheriff Tammy is the law. Judge, jury, and jailer.

It's a sweltering hot day, and as she lists my numerous, dastardly offenses, she's, um, changing her attire to fit the local weather conditions. By the time she finishes the list, she's completely out of uniform, and it's a wonderful sight. As our let's pretend game heats up, I will be imagining an arrest by a certain other sheriff, but on that part I'll exercise my right to remain silent. What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

""How do you plead?"" she demands, towering above me.

""Guilty,"" I say, without remorse. ""Untie me and I'll do it all again."" She can't help but smile at that.

""Well then,"" she says, and unzips the large duffel bag next to her. Let's see what the sheriff has in her bag of toys today.

Huh.

A chainsaw.

""I know about her,"" my wife says, and starts it up."
qtz82w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qtz82w/shooting_children/,Shooting Children,178,12,1636923317.0,"Karina was dreaming of sunshine when she was dragged out of her lice-infested bunk. She screamed at the sudden disruption and felt her face being slapped viciously. The soldier laughed and started to push her outside into the bitter night.

As she adjusted to the harshness of the floodlit brightness she tripped and fell into the gore-filled mud. The guards reacted with humour and anger, kicking her hard in the ribs. Karina raised herself up, apologising. The guards rushed her through the freezing, stabbing rain towards a large cabin.

Inside, Karina was hit by the warmth of a fire bristling in the corner. She was given a towel by one of the guards and ordered to dry herself. As she ran the coarse cloth over her hands and overalls the door to the cabin reopened. Hearing voices behind her, Karina turned around to see an emaciated group of children. They all looked deep into her eyes.

The kinder were ordered to stand against the bloodstained back wall of the cabin. When they huddled together in fear, a guard separated them, spacing them apart. One of the younger girls had wet herself and the guard hit her and called her a 'pissing rat.'

The same guard then approached Karina, removing the black scarf he was wearing. He wrapped it around her head, hiding her sight. Before her vision went she noticed the guards chalking the numbers *eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs* on a blackboard.

*""Strecke deine hand aus!""* A guard shouted. Karina held out her hand and felt the coldness of a gun.

Six bullets. They were betting on how many she would kill.

*""Erschieß die kleinen ratten!""*

Karina would be shot if she refused. She prayed for forgiveness. *Teshuvah.*

Behind her, she heard the door reopen and more people push in, shuffling excitedly around for space, here to witness the filthy little Jew playing their cruel game. She heard more, indistinct young voices as they were being pushed to the back wall. The bastards had brought more children in.

To pre-empt any consideration she might have of using the gun on the guards, Karina felt the tip of another gun at the back of her shaved head.

*Strzelać!*

The first shot was the hardest. Karina shut out the painful screams of the young boy she had hit. The second was met with a disappointed bellow from behind; she had missed. The third and fourth elicited excited cheers and her stomach churned. Shot five was followed by a horrific splitting noise from the back wall.

The sixth bullet she fired haphazardly. There was laughter.

The scarf was untied and removed. Karina was spun around to see the hardened faces of the Soviet Red Army. They had taken over the camp.

The Jewish children were sitting by the fire eating bread, while the guards were tied up nearby, calling out in desperate, muffled howls.

Turning back, Karina stared disturbingly at the dead bodies of the guards' children slumped against the wall."

Her name was Dorothy, but her family called her Rot. This was on account that she emanated a putrid odor even after she bathed. She could take a cactus and rub her skin raw and still the stink would follow her like a simp. 

“I’d do you good if you didn’t smell so much like a skunk’s ass,” either one of her three uncles was fond of telling her on a drunken night. He’d shake his head and *tsk* his disappointment, then walk out to the barn where he’d fondle Bessie the cow. 

One day, a tornado came and plucked Rot away. It dropped her off in a land full of overgrown babies. Clad in diapers and sucking on Phallic shaped lollipops, these overgrown babes drooled and mumbled gibberish. Snot ran down their oversized faces and they laughed as they groped for Rot, so she ran, choosing a path of yellow color. The singing babies jittered after her. As Rot ran, she realized her feet were splashing as if she were traversing a stream. If it were not for her own overpowering smell, she would have realized the yellow path laid out was a river of piss created none other than by the creatures that followed. 

Because of the creature’s short stature, Rot managed to escape, whereupon she found herself surrounded on either side by corn stalks. 

“Hiya miss.” 

Rot jumped at the words, for there was only a scarecrow in the vicinity. 

“Mind helping me down?” It was the scarecrow uttering speech.

But it wasn’t really a scarecrow. It was a man. He was stuck to a wooden cross. Upon closer inspection, Rot realized he was pierced through the chest like a piece of meat on a knife. The man wriggled and thrashed. Entrails sticking out from his stomach like…well like straw from a scarecrow. 

“Please help!” The stuck figure pleaded.

“You should be dead.”

“Nothing dies in this land! Now Help me…help me.” His pleas died down as if it took too much effort. He shook his head violently. “Do you ever feel your bones? I mean like really feel them…the tarsals and metatarsals and decatarsals? Do you know what it feels like to be stuck in one spot and know each of your bones intimately as if it were your sibling? I feel like ripping them off! I would bite off my limbs if it would get me down, much like I’d drown a brother if it meant I’d live another day.”

Rot had begun approaching the distressed figure, but at this last remark she stopped. Then turned and walked away, thinking of babes with puffy faces thrashing in water.

“Come back you bitch!”

Rot sprinted away until the sounds of a mad, thrashing man ceased. She ran into a forest and into dangers hitherto undreamt of…"

Stella lived just next to my street, there used to live one introverted guy in Stella's neighbourhood who I had befriended, you know introverts seek introverts. He used to tell me about the whos, whens, whys of Stella. 

One daring, oh yeah for me even gulping down a glass of water is a daring task, so one Daring night it so happened that I lost all my patience and opened FB, Stella wasn't online, I sent her a message 'Stella I like, I mean love you, please respond, I wanted to say this since long'. 

A day later Stella responded with a big 'Nooooo', and had blocked me. 

I couldn't stand the rejection, days were passing and I was growing anxious and kinda demoralised. My ego had also been shattered. 

'Meet your love, make her/him love you, 100% guaranteed solution' was an email I'd received on Gmail. I opened and there was just a number which I immediately dialed. 

Hello, is this Joshua? 

Yes. 

Sir, I love a girl who has rejected my proposal. I anyhow want to make her fall for me. 

Okay...choose one among the three options herein : 

1.Complete Control
2.Mild Control
3.No Control just slow paced love 

1, please go on with 1. 

Well, OK, please press all the keys of your keyboard one by one as the IVR says... 

Alright... 

And so I did... I pressed the keys as was being guided by the IVR. 

There you have it, now use your keyboard to anytime bring her to your place, make her jump, sleep, etc. We'll also send a manual shortly. Nice day Sir. 

I was kinda frightened but happy at the same time. I pressed F1 and there came running my Stella. Anguished she was, then she yelled 'Moron... What brought me here? What's happening? 

I sent her back with backspace. Although I immediately called the guy again. Over phone, 

Yes? Sir. 

Hey, she's still angry with me, there doesn't seem to be any change, the key just brought her here and nothing else could it do. 

Sir, it can do to its limits only... 

Huh! Then.... Umm... Well... Man I know she'll never agree, so what does the power button do? 

It kills the person, Sir! 

I pressed the power button immediately."

There was a moment’s silence. No-one liked to contradict Marina or even question her, but – “How? We are all in lockdown. We can’t get together!”

Marina shot Shaadi a withering glance, the full effect of which was lost due unstable internet connection. “I am well aware. But we are the bearers of ancient feminine wisdom. A government-medical hoax, even on this scale, will not hold us back. Our ancestresses were burned at the stake for their beliefs. We will not let these petty fear-mongers stop us.”

An admiring murmur rose. Then Kelly said “yes Marina- it’s just- how? I mean obviously we have to make the Sacrifice, it’s more important this year than ever!”

“I will make it, right here. Myself. I am fully capable of doing it. You can participate virtually. I have no worries about that.”

Her calm confidence reassured everybody. Marina continued, “However, I will need your assistance in bringing Dr. Sivaram here. Kelly, Shaadi, you are in each other’s bubble, are you not? And he’s your families’ doctor? I trust you can take care of that part?”

Kelly and Shaadi’s faces froze on the screen. Then they flickered back into motion. “Of course Marina” they chorused obediently.

\*\*\*

Everything went well on Halloween. The empty streets were a sad reminder of the pandemic, but it worked to their advantage. Kelly and Shaadi had done exactly as Marina had instructed them to do, placing Dr Sivaram’s unresisting body on the Stone in Marina’s cellar right on time and hastily chanting preliminary incantations before leaving. Marina had gone down within twenty minutes of their departure, and started the Zoom meeting.

Everybody was gathered. The tension was palpable even online. Marina had all the lights on, and they could see clearly into the cellar. It was almost as good as the real thing.

Marina looked absolutely majestic, as she moved around making preparations, occasionally giving them a glance of her naked body underneath her magnificent robe. The sound of the knife being sharpened whizzed through cyberspace. The others chanted in harmony.

Dr Sivaram breathed peacefully, as if the Stone was his bed at home.

The chant was ending “…accept this alien oh Almighty…” Marina was standing over him, completely naked, the Knife held high.

And then it happened.

The group watched in helpless horror as Dr Sivaram rose, and with the advantage of surprise, easily wrestled the knife out of Marina’s shocked hands. Either Kelly and Shaadi had messed up, or he possessed deeper power than theirs.

Screams echoed through Zoom as Dr Sivaram forced Marina’s head on the Stone and slit her throat, placing the bucket expertly to catch the blood. Then he turned to the laptop and smiled deeply. In his dapper blood-spattered suit, he was menacing in a way poor naked twitching Marina never had been. “Behold” he said. “Your new overlord.”

My mom who went to work in the early hours of the morning was a light sleeper and would always run to my room. When coming out of one these sleep induced terrors all my senses would be running on overdrive. My mom learned early on that flooding the room with light would cause me panic. She would turn on a single light either in the kitchen or bathroom, grab my hand and slowly guide me through the darkness allowing my eyesight to adjust. As time went on bad dreams took a backseat to other medical ailments like when I was diagnosed with asthma at age 10. Still whenever I needed her my mom would be there at my bed side. One night when I was 13 I awoke from another nightmare. I looked up to see a feminine silhouette hovered over me. She grabbed my hand and ripped me out of bed and pulled me into through the dark tunnel of the hallway. I fought hard, screaming and crying. As the rays of light creeped into view I managed to wrangle my hand out of her powerful grasp and ran back into of my room. I awoke in gasped breathes covered in sweat and realized I was having an asthma attack and reached over to my night table for my inhaler. A couple of puffs later and I sat  in my bed in shock. I don’t know what was more terrifying in that moment. That my deceased mother was still guiding me to the light or that something else was. "

Final-fucking-ly. I’d been on Tinder for eight years and hadn’t had a single match. For some reason Western women REALLY had it out for me.

I took Serena to a film. As I stood by the concession with my jumbo popcorn and extra-large Sprite, waiting for her to buy her own ticket, the cashier looked at us then screwed up his face.

Afterward, I took her home, where I flexed my Vortex Tab90M keyboard. The flashing LEDs really made her eyes sparkle. In the bedroom, I undid my tie and unbuttoned my shirt, before finally stepping out of my cargo shorts.

Serena slid out of her gown, exposing an excessive amount of thigh hair and tattoos across her lower back. I made a mental note to mention these flaws on our second date.

“Are those Norse symbols?” I asked, recognizing the pattern from God of war.

“They are.”

“What possessed you to get them?”

“I’m a witch.”

I chuckled. Of course she was into Harry Potter. Serena was lucky we’d met—now I could introduce her to more sophisticated entertainment like Dune or Ricky and Morty.

“You should—”

With a snap of her fingers, Serena made me fly across the room as if yanked by a bungee. I was suddenly pinned against the wall.

“Whats going on?” I cried.

She strolled across the room and placed a hand on my chest. “I’m taking your soul.”

“M-my soul? You can’t!”

“Pipe down. This’ll be over soon.”

“NO! TELL ME WHY!”

“Souls have great power. I need them to produce spells. So I wander around harvesting fat neckbeards nobody will miss.”

“But why take mine?”

Serenas hand turned cold, as if she’d just had it submerged in snow, and I felt a great draining sensation. All color seemed to seep from the world.

“Will I die?”

“You’ll become a ghost,” she said, clearly annoyed by my questions. 

“A ghost?! Explain!”

“Uhhhh. Without a soul, you’ll just be meat. People will only notice you when looking *directly* at you. The second they glance away you’ll disappear from their memory.” A silver whisp floated out of my chest into Serena’s hand, where she ushered it into a vial, in a gesture resembling vape tricks I’d learned from YouTube.

“You can’t take my soul. Please. I have too much to live for.”

She rolled her eyes. “How’s this: tell me one thing you did in the past two months that doesn’t involve video games, masturbating, or calling women whores, and you can keep your crummy soul.”

And that’s the story of how I became a ghost. Now I wander around, dead to the world.

Fortunately, I discovered when playing games online my teammates still notice and react to my avatar, and people online can still see my Reddit posts.

So really, not much has changed."

He is my special little boy as he has never spoken in his life. We have gone to numerous doctors and they all say he is perfectly healthy. I can tell my wife Isabel (27f) is worried about him but I keep reassuring her that he is just a late bloomer.

Bobby hates being touched by people and will literally start screaming at the top of his lungs if someone so much as grazes up against him. I know that I am partly at fault for this but I always act surprised by it.

This morning was our bi monthly father son camping trip in my cabin in the woods. I could see the fear in Bobby's eyes as he climbed into the car but he knew he had no choice but to come. I kissed Isabel goodbye and told her that we would be back Sunday evening.

It was a two hour journey so I listened to some System Of A Down and Soil to keep myself amused. I was so happy when we arrived as it meant I get to partake in my favourite activity with my son. I got everything setup and told Bobby to go get ready.

Bobby changed into the t shirt and underwear that was provided for him and reluctantly followed me outside. I picked him up and kissed him on the forehead before throwing him headfirst into the wood chipper.

 I listened to his screams of agony as the blades pulverised his body and the bloody remains were sprayed out the far side. I watched as his body slowly began to regenerate itself and couldn't help but smile as he lay on the ground weeping. I picked up the axe and prepared for my next bit of fun and thanked god that I had such a special child"

Not just hungry, but *starving*. My stomach is growling. Pain rolls across my stomach in droves. Acid sloshes against the lining, making it bleed.

I’ve just eaten dinner too, which makes it even more puzzling. And I didn’t just eat a simple takeaway—I feasted at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Yet, barely 5 minutes later, I feel like I haven’t eaten for days.

I drive over to the nearest restaurant and order up a storm. Appetisers, entrees, desserts, pretty much everything on the menu. The waitress nods furiously and scribbles down my order.

The wait is agonising. My stomach feels like it is eating itself.

When the food finally arrives, I don’t even wait for the waitress to put it down on the table. I grab the food off the plate and shovel it into my mouth.

Everything tastes delicious.

But I’m still hungry.

Luckily there’s street food all around me, hot dogs, churros, popcorn. At first I try playing nice and queuing up for my food, but then hunger overtakes my etiquette and I cut to the front of the line, much to the protests of the people behind. I’m so hungry I even snatch food off people and gobble it up, much to their disgust and dismay.

I eat and eat and eat, until there are sauces smeared all over my mouth and there are breadcrumbs in my beard.

But I’m still hungry!

Every day I eat. Takeaways. Groceries delivered to my home. Street food.

But soon I run out of money. My credit cards are all declined. 

I’m still hungry though.

I chance upon the old man one day, when the hunger is near unbearable, playing his harmonica. He gives me a sorrowful look, his eyes praying I have a few spare change to give him.

He also is a delicious walking bag of flesh.

He does not scream as I pounce, my hands reaching for his throat. Claws rip out of my nails and dig in deep, streaking blood on his skin. His eyes are wide and he chokes on his blood.

The light rushes out of his eyes at last.

Victorious, I lean down and tear out his skin with my teeth, now sharp as knives. As I chew and swallow, licking my lips, my stomach lets out a sigh of relief.

I’m full at last."

How can we not do a jump shot atop such a mesmerizing hill!?"" My friend who was controlling the drone hovering above us exclaimed. Readying up my legs for launch, I jumped with the rest of the group. My left leg was however feeling very heavy all of a sudden. My heel felt like it was being pulled profusely. Nevertheless, I shook whatever feeling I had off, feeling it was the fatigue that caught on to me.

On the way downhill, I saw something that caught my eye. I told the rest of the group to proceed first, mentioning I had to take a leak. Upon further inspecting on the grass patch, I saw a young girl that was sitting down on a huge rock, albeit with fairly tattered clothing with a basket spilled under with what I thought were herbs. I was a bit scared at first.

However, the girl meekly whimpered that she accidentally fell down when trying to bring some herbs back home and had been resting for a bit. Without thinking too much, I offered to carry her behind my back to ferry for down to the base of the hills. When I approached her, I could see that she was actually missing her left leg. I didn't ask her as I felt it would be insensitive and it was likely an accident or from birth, both which are pitiful in its own rights.

Carrying the basket of herbs on my hands and tightly placing her on my back, we made our way down the remainder of the hill, which was actually not too far off. After five minutes or so, she whispered to my ears, ""It's alright now. Thank you very much. If only there is someone like you. I will take my leave now."" Bidding farewell to her after returning the basket, I made my way to my friends.

Perhaps I was too tired, I did not see the oncoming car that approached me. I thought my friends were waving at me. But they were giving me a warning. Everything was pitch black.

Months of physiotherapy sessions, and I could finally walk as per normal again! Returning home, I decided to have an early night's rest. Before that, I took out my laptop to view that eventful trip which I ironically had the accident with. My eyes widened. I could see the same girl I saw in the hills pulling my left leg in the jump shot. 

I wanted to scream. I trembled and return to the comfort of my bed. My left leg however, was very heavy and was shaking profusely. I had to drag my leg and finally I was back on bed. I covered myself under the blanket. My left leg was shaking like no tomorrow again. Having cold sweat everywhere on my face is an understatement. Below the blanket, I could feel something moving, I could hear ""Thank you.."""

A friend of mine got me a temp job working with him at the airport and every morning I’d catch a ride to work with him.

We’d take the same route every day and on the way would see this little boy waiting on his porch for the school bus. He would usually sit or stand while waiting. We would pass him going to and from the daycare, so as time passed I barely noticed him at all. 

One fall morning, we passed by him to the daycare and as usual, he was sitting on the porch. However, on the way back my friend said “what the hell is up with this kid?” I turned to see him on the porch crouching on all fours looking at us while baring his teeth and growling. I felt like a rock dropped in my stomach and my heart kicked into overdrive. Everything felt like slow motion dream. 

I looked away and stared out the passenger window when a car drove up next to us. I noticed each window had frost around the edges (usual for fall, but still weird because no other car had it). When I got a look at the driver all I saw was a black hooded figure looking down and suddenly the steering wheel turned on it’s own moving the car away from us. I was paralyzed with fear. All I kept repeating was “oh my God” while pointing at the car. My chest felt like it was being pressed down and I couldn’t breathe. My friend kept asking me if I was ok but I couldn’t answer him.

I wanted her to live her life to the fullest, finish university and get a stable job before dating. I don't want my daughter to have another man in his life, I don't want to be her no. 2 in her heart. I don't want our father-daughter Sundays to be over.. That was when I had decided to confront her after dinner.. which led to screaming, fighting and a thud.

It's been a few days already, my daughter still hasn't left the room and I haven't forgiven her, but I had eventually calmed down and forgot all about it. One day her fiancé(25M) has knocked on the door, asking to see my daughter. I, who was infuriated that time, gave him a harsh ""what?"" knowing very well what he wants. We had an argument for over 2 hours before I went back in, whirring sounds can be heard, and back out with a box, handed it to him, and dragged him inside for a formal conversation. 

That dinner, as my wife tastes the roasted meat I made to celebrate our anniversary, she suddenly said: "" this meat is one of a kind, what is this?"" to which I replied: ""of course it's one of a kind, no one can taste this good other than our daughter""

That was 10 years ago. Every night after that dinner, all I can hear are chains rattling, muffled screams, and silent whimpers..

""But tonight is the night I'll finally end it all"" I said as I picked up the axe, ending the lives of the 35M Darryl David and 59F Beverly Claire. 

""now no one's gonna get your hand in marriage,
 little birdie, because I have had it first"" were the last words I said to the bloody box I gave to her fiancé a decade ago, before the cops busted down the bedroom door to find a bloody ""mess"" as they called it. I thought it was a masterpiece, it was inspired by my daughter, after all.

I saw more useless posts than I could count up until I reached a certain video which particularly caught my interest. The video was a plain old meme with a picture of man standing in a dark room with the dim light of a TV flashing on his face, below was text that read “Me staring out the window of 82 W Broadway Street, NYC on December 3rd, 2021 3:16 PM witnessing the stairway to heaven incident.” Over the video, the song “It’s Just a Burning Memory” played, however this was no surprise as I’ve seen countless videos similar to this. But none had that spark like this one. 19 days later I stood on that very street, 82 W Broadway Street, NYC at 3:13 PM. I wasn’t staring out of a window, I wasn’t witnessing anything. I was there, in the street. Snow began falling and time began passing as I stood in the middle of the road, waiting. It wasn’t until 3:16 PM that I realized my pure foolishness. In this dark, empty street on this cloudy, cold day I had nothing to witness. I heard nothing but the wind blowing and saw nothing but street lamps and snow. I looked down to my feet and then back up at the road. That’s when I saw a man peering through his window, watching me."

Ever since I was a little kid, I was seeing fairies outside my classroom window and mermaids in the waters under the nearby pier. I was teased for a time because of this, namely by schoolmates who thought it was silly for a boy to be interested in such things. I never quite understood that. Why were tiny, kidnapping hunter-gatherers and aquatic, cannibalistic warriors considered so feminine? I imagined other things, too. Like the dead. I don't know how or why, but I could imagine visions of dead people I had never met or even heard of.

I was never in great control of my imaginings. Much of the time, they seemed to do whatever they wanted. I would imagine random, unremarkable strangers out on the street. Sometimes, I instead came up with more intriguing characters, who held meetings in mushroom circles or flew in strange patterns that clearly meant something, I just didn't know what. But of course, I had to know what they were doing, because I clearly imagined it. I puzzled over this for several nights, but it hardly affected me. I despise sleeping. I settled on the explanation that I had simply forgotten all that. With a head filled with dragons and changelings, I must be constantly losing track of certain things.

Sometimes the things I imagine scare me. There are people with ever-bleeding wounds from grizzly deaths, terrifying spirits stalking the wild woods, and mysteriously small children who just stare at me. I don't know what came over me to imagine things like this. It's become harder and harder to remind myself that these things aren't real, especially when they keep insisting that they are. But these people- no, these things have to be pretend, because no-one else can see them. I once met a girl who said she was like me because she saw my imaginings too. At first, this mystery scared me more than any of my other monsters until I realized I must have imagined her too. I must have, for how else would she know all about things that were too absurd to be real?

I must not have been thinking straight when I imagined that girl, because she was very easy to get rid of. It was a fantastic moment, realizing that my horrid hallucinations could be killed the same as any other annoyance. Most of them, anyway. I still haven't figured out how to un-imagine the ones that are already dead, but this was certainly a start. I'll admit I was a tad concerned at my apparent persistence for imagining a corpse, and later several more corpses of varying size and species, but I take it as a testament to the power of my own mind. After all, if I was capable of imagining these shameful things I should be allowed to undo that act. Besides, it's not like I'll get caught doing this. It's all in my imagination, right?"

Weeks later... 

I again sent her a message to which a heartbreaking 'No' alongside 'Don't ever message me again' was written. If not anger then what could've been my reaction to such a ruthless rejection of hers? 

At midnight I went to her room wherein she used to live all alone and saw a tattoo  imprinted on her wrist, 'Peter' was written on it, her boyfriend's name. 

I killed her, brutally and as ruthlessly as she'd been whilst replying. 

The next phase as expected was guilt, I was guilty of having committed such a heinous act, I should've refrained, I should've waited, I should've tried again... 

Though an arrow once fired off can't be retrieved back... Diana had died because of me of which I couldn't find any compensation since there couldn't have been any anyway. 

I was angry over my arm, yes the very arm which I had used to suffocate her to death, I suffocated her single handedly whilst my left hand made sure her immobility. 

And as decided I chopped off my right arm, it was the least that could be done, but still I did. 

A day later... 

Whilst asleep I saw Diana in my dream. 

The other day I and my cousin were sitting in the dining area when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in the remaining right arm of mine, whilst my cousin was busy with her phone my arm started to grow... It grew back... But kinda too rapidly... It kinda dragged me to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and chopped my cousin's head. 

It had me under control, whilst I was sobbing it dragged me towards a mirror installed in the hallway, it's where it stabbed me multiple times in the chest meanwhile all I could see was the wrist on which was written 'Peter'."

Because if there was one thing he hated, it was a charlatan. People who used smoke and mirrors, emotions and misdirection, to take advantage of vulnerable people. And those faith healers over there in America, with their earpieces and sleight of hand and doublespeak, their sweeping through bank accounts—they were the worst charlatans of all.

The concept was simple. Talk like a yank, ask in awe if he and his crew could document them, and watch them fall by their own hubris when he exposed their deceitful techniques. He was funded, he was lawyered up, and he was mad enough to be daring.

The documentary enraptured nations. There was outrage of course. But there was also healing. People breaking from their religious abusers. Honest dialogue. The most important thing was the truth.

This was what he believed until he received the email. The video of his little boy teetering at the top of the steeple, tied up and blindfolded in the dead of night. The one sentence of text: “Do a retraction or we’ll ‘retract’ his life.”

&#x200B;

“So the footage exposing these preachers playing tricks, you *faked all of it*?” The ladies of The Opinion were appalled, and expertly invoking disgust in their jeering audience.

“Yes,” he said. “I, ironically, am the one who committed the fraud while claiming to expose it, and I am deeply sorry.”

A woman committed suicide when her chemotherapy didn’t take. They’d told her she hadn’t prayed hard enough.

A little boy, heart full of faith in what he saw the reverend demonstrate, made his own attempt to handle a snake and died from the venomous bite.

A man perished giving his life savings to his pastor after the claim that this act of faith, not medicine, would cure him. His children with his same condition believed it when the pastor said their father must have secretly held Satan in his heart. They gave more of their money to avoid his fate.

And those were just within the congregations he had covered.

Too quiet to be a spectacle, countless people in pain and suffering woke up every day and anguished in their dread. Destroyed that it still didn’t work. A devastating prelude, they believed, to an even more torturous future for not having God’s truth in their heart.

The doctors were all sympathetic for him and seeing how they could make him feel better while seeing what the problem is. He was a 70 year old who did construction for a living a while ago, so everyone thought it was something with that. 

They got him on IV and took vitals etc. and he stayed the night in the hospital. His wife came in the next day spend the day with him and help doctors out with his needs. Apparently he had a pacemaker for after all that work, also a shunt for another condition. Doctors closely monitored the pacemaker and shunt and then determined to get a CT scan done to see what was going on. 

The patient was fine with this just so that he could get out of the hospital as soon as possible to his farm and the animals. I was the doctor who did the CT scan and we arranged him to be comfortable. The other doctors left afterwards, as this was my profession. At that moment the CT scanner shut down and I had to move the patient to the MRI machine. I apologized numerous times since his head was hurting more but we eventually got him comfortable. He have me the thumbs up and I turned it on. I watched as the man went into the dome and then almost instantly he started screaming and there was a ripping sound. 

For he had just gotten the pacemaker ripped out of him and the shunt was sticking to the dome, blood and brains dripping. I smiled to myself, the patients just didn’t know who the serial killer really was as I collected the mans head and added it to my collection of twenty.

qtay4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qtay4b/marked/,Marked,135,3,1636840074.0,"On the first of November, Barbara Krietsch noticed a capital letter “D” had been carved into the rear bumper of her red, mid-sized, four-door sedan. If she hadn’t been running late for work that morning, she would’ve stomped next door to the Friedrich household, pounded on the door, and demanded that their two, unruly teenage boys be held accountable. Not that she had any real proof; it was just that those two were always making rude gestures toward her, from the safety of their parents’ front yard. 

The “E” showed up nearly a week later, printed immediately after the “D”. This one couldn’t have been done by the Friedrich boys, as she found it after an hour-long shopping trip to her local grocery store. The grocery store manager, after much arm-twisting and verbal harassment--agreed to let her watch the parking lot surveillance footage. Not surprisingly, the footage consisted only of grainy camera images which were too blurry and time-delayed to identify any potential suspects.

The following week, after an “A” had been carved into the bumper, Barbara’s anger turned to amusement when she saw the panicked reactions of the drug dealers at the corner gas station, when she passed in the mornings. She couldn’t believe that any sane person would think the Drug Enforcement Agency would carve their organization’s initials into their car bumpers, but then again she figured that these dealers were probably not the brightest tools in the shed. However, she thought twice about leaving those letters on her car, just in case someone came looking for her...someone with a gun. She also made sure to inform the police, since the Friedrich family refused to make amends, though she still didn’t have any substantial proof of their guilt.

A paint job at the local car body shop was supposed to discourage further acts of vandalism, but it didn’t. Not two days after the car had been repaired, Barbara found a fresh and new “D-E-A-T” had been carved into the bumper. The most disturbing part of this was that the car had been parked in Barbara’s garage overnight, which meant that someone must have broken in to do it, though neither the locks nor the doors reflected this fact. She again called the police; a very kind Officer Riley agreed to keep an eye on her house. He also suggested she drive another vehicle. Barbara refused to let a cowardly, unseen troll bully her into giving up her beloved car, so she just smiled, nodded, and ignored the good officer’s advice.

Seven days later, on the very same morning that Barbara discovered a newly-carved letter on her bumper, the smoldering remains of her and her car lay strewn across four lanes of the I-20 eastbound, near the Exit 199 on-ramp. Eyewitnesses claimed that the fuel tanker had appeared practically out of thin air to strike Barbara’s speeding vehicle. Sadly, all she left behind was a chunk of bumper carved with a capital letter “H”."

It surprised me. Well, I often eat at the computer, but I'm not a slob. Also, I didn't find cockroaches in the kitchen.

One night I waked up and heard a strange clicking sound. It came from my computer. I sat up, looked in that direction and... blinked several times. There were cockroaches jumping up and down on the keyboard.

Suddenly they disappeared. 'Am I hallucinating?' I thought.

I stood up and walked to the table. I had left my last project open, planning to continue working in the morning. Now it was almost finished. 

'Oh, it's a dream,' I smiled. I clicked 'Save' just in case and began reading the code. And felt a chill run up my spine.

The code was... brilliant. Short, fast, and... inhuman? I would never write something like that. 'Cockroaches did it?' I just couldn't believe it.


When I wake up in the morning, I remembered the dream and smiled. Then I looked at the display and froze.

The code was here.

After a couple of hours I got enough courage to compile the program. It turned out that it was significantly shorter and faster than the ones I wrote before.


This has been going on for six month now: I leave the task, and they write. I do not understand how their programs work. I think it is a question of time before cockroaches take over the planet. I think this is what they want."

They always preferred my big brother over me. They would compare everything I did to him. Nothing was ever good enough. No matter how hard I tried, I knew that they'd always like him more, and there was nothing I could do it.

When I turned 11, my brother moved out. Maybe now that Jack had left my parents would finally start caring about me. Any thoughts of this dissolved when my mom got pregnant less than a week later. 

The dreaded day arrived; my sister was born. I don't believe she ever stopped screaming after leaving the hospital. She would whimper and cry all night, while my mom and dad hushed her to sleep. I got hardly any sleep - and there were some days where I didn't get any at all. I began wishing for my brother back.

Almost nothing changed when she got older. When she turned 5, and I turned 16, she started saying that there was a ""monster under her bed"". Even my parents started to lose patience with her as she flat out refused to go to bed. They tried reading her an extra story, tucking her in, giving her snacks- anything for their perfect child. But my sister was still terrified. Nothing our parents could do would convince her that there wasn't a monster. She would wake up at night, hysterical, and say that the monster almost got her. They already gave her so much attention - why did she need any more?

A few days ago, my parents decided to go on a short vacation. They hugged and kissed my sister goodnight, did a ""monster check"" under her bed, and left me to babysit her.

The minute they left, I began formulating a plan. At 10 pm that night, I crept out of my room. I silently turned her doorknob and opened the door. My sister was sleeping on her bed, her arms wrapped around her. I eagerly snatched her pillow from her head, my yes alight with manic fire. She began to stir after about half a minute, and that just made me push it harder. Impatience got the better of me and I flung her duvet over her head to quicken the process. After about 5 minutes, her last breath was extinguished. I had killed my sister. I had expected to feel something, but instead, I felt numb. The shock must have addled with my brain, I reasoned with myself.

Minutes passed, and I was still trying to come to terms with what I'd done. Maybe that's why I didn't move when I heard a snarl from under the bed. Something stirred under the bed, something brutal, something deadly. With my heart in my throat, I slowly lowered myself off the bed and stared into the void of darkness below.

Three milky white eyes loomed back at me."

Our paradise shattered when we found it was impossible for her to carry. We grieved the death of our dream. Surrogacy or adoption wasn't an option for her.

She was aloof and distant for a while, which morphed into indignation. We needed to keep trying.

 ""All of the doctors are wrong.""

 In hindsight, that was the first sign.

She religiously tracked her cycles to ensure we didn't miss the ""fertie"" window. She brought trinkets from shamans to improve fertility. They gave her a small macabre doll that she treated as an actual baby, supposedly it triggers baby-making hormones and strengthens the womb. 

I once woke up sweating to find the doll mere inches away from my face, her face distorted and grotesque for the second it took me to blink.

Visiting a mental health specialist would have been a good idea.

Somehow the pregnancy test came back positive. I wanted to take her to the doctor, for a checkup but she flat out refused all medical intervention.

She was having weird cravings, her penchant being rare, bloody steak with a side of pickles.  She would sing and sway, caressing the bump she named Lara.

As the date drew near she decided on a home water birth with just the two of us. I obliged but kept a midwife on speed dial. 

Her water broke in the middle of the night. I prepped the bathtub and got the supplies.

She squeezed the living daylights out of my hand as she pushed Lara out. I leaned in to see my miracle baby. Nothing. I was still staring at the clear water when she scooped something in her arms. ""Isn't she beautiful?"" 

I had no choice but to play along. I called the mental support helpline, for me as much for her. They suggested bringing her in, ""It could be a psychotic break coupled with pseudocyesis, a phantom pregnancy,"" they said.

But she wasn't violent, everything seemed fine except for her maternal hallucinations. My checkup was normal but I couldn't get her to have one. 

Trapped in her psychosis ""Lara"" was growing fast.  ""Lara"" was crawling, standing then walking within a week. She said Lara's giggles sound like little bells. 

Today, I think I am also losing my mind, she's laughing about something Lara said. 

""Lara! Not the stairs.."" THUMP. 

I rush to where my wife lay broken at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes open for all eternity. 

I can feel the guilt eating at my heart like acid burns everything in its path. I should have done more. I hunch over her sobbing. 

My heart drops in my chest as I feel a light weight on my shoulders, warmth of a hug spreading on my back. The hair on my neck stands on end at the sound of soft giggling, reminiscent of bells."

She was there when I needed help on my school science project. I ended up spilling water all over the floor while reaching over for the glue. She didn’t even flinch, she just chuckled and said

“Guess I won’t be needing to mop the kitchen floor tonight.”

She was there for me when dad made our neighbors close their blinds. When he made them turn up their TVs to drown out the sounds of him beating me. She comforted me those nights. She would cry and her tears would roll off her bruised chin onto my forehead.

She was there for me when dad had left us. He left on a stormy night after they had a big fight and he just disappeared into the night. Dad had a little too much to drink too often. Mom didn’t like that about him, and neither did I. That day she cried and held me and said

“Don’t be angry at him Billy, everyone gets their return eventually.”

She was there for me when we went to his funeral two weeks after. His body was discovered behind a pub, hidden behind trash bags. An employee found his rotten body being eaten by crows and maggots, so they called the cops immediately.

After he died, mom was the happiest I had ever seen her. Life was good for a while, we had taco Tuesday and pizza Friday every week, but then she got a new boyfriend. And this boyfriend was a lot like dad. He made her cry, and he made me sad.

""Mom”- she began. 

Mom whirled on her furiously, “Amy Johnson, I am sick to death of your excuses about why you can’t take the garbage. It’s disgraceful that there is one thing you can do to support your brother, and you’re outright lying to get out of it!” 

-”I’m not lying! And this has nothing to do with Tommy on the soccer team! There’s something in the bins- it moves!” 

Mom smashed the kitchen knife down so hard the chopping board cracked. “Can there be one night in this house where there is no argument over garbage!” she screamed.  

Amy turned and fled.  

Struggling with the heavy bags, she made her away across the parking lot to where the giant bins loomed, green, blue, and black in the twilight. People dumped bags around the bins rather than placing them in- Amy did that herself, scared of the noises coming from them. But she couldn’t do that anymore- the superintendent had seen her dump the bags and told Mom. That had not been a good day.  

Amy realised Tommy hadn’t got into the soccer team to make her life miserable, but since he was always at practice, she had to do his chores, on top of her own. She wasn’t no good at school anyway, so she might as well be useful around the house, Mom often said. She should be grateful to support her family, and stop complaining. But a family of active teens produced so much garbage! Amy felt life had become constant sorting of trash and bins. And this noise. “Just racoons” Dad had remarked offhandedly, overhearing her, but that didn’t help.  

The bags on the ground moved- maybe they were overstuffed and collapsing? Amy peered in the dark. Something – things- were moving? The scuffling noise was unmistakable. How big are racoons? It seemed impossible to go further and reach the bins. She imagined lifting the lids and putting the bags inside the bins and knew she would die if she did that.  

The noise stopped. The parking lot was empty. A car drove by and in the headlights. Amy clearly saw three big racoons walking towards her steadily, their white patches and eyes shining. She screamed, dropping the three bags, scattering all the garbage on the ground. Her worst nightmare. She sank to the ground sobbing- hoping the racoons would kill her quickly.  

The scuffling noise started again. Something soft and furry touched her bare leg. Amy looked through her compost-slimed hands. The three racoons were whisking around, diligently sorting the spilled garbage, occasionally pausing to take a bite to eat.  

Slowly Amy got up. The racoons paid her no mind. Then one of them looked directly at her. Amy was no longer afraid. She turned, and walked back to her family."

I swept his dark curls from his face, tucking the covers around him tightly.

“I think this is the Climbing Man’s.”

Dread fills me. Oh no, not another Climbing Man tale. Not before bed. Ben would be up again in three hours at even the mention of his imaginary monster, wailing and hammering on my bedroom door, scratching at it like a desperate animal. I try to quickly deflect it.

“This?” I hold up the toy with a smile. It’s one of those small, rubber men - typical Christmas cracker junk. They’re designed to fold themselves down windows, shower screens, and mark up every nice wall in the apartment. Ben was a professional apartment wall wrecker with that dreaded toy.

“Yeah. It looks just like him.” Ben frowned “Do you think he’ll want it?”

“I don’t think so, darling.” I sigh, kissing Ben’s hair “But I can bin it, if you’d like.”

Ben quickly swiped his figure back, dashing my hopes of a clean home. He shifts as if the tiny object really needed the room, tucking the rubbery plastic toy beside him.

“The Climbing Man couldn’t fit in my bed.” Ben mused, staring at the ceiling “Coz he’s way bigger. Bigger than you, even!”

“*Way* bigger?” I scoff.

“As big as the door! He gets stuck, which is why he can’t get us. His legs and arms are too big.”

“No more.” I smile firmly “Bedtime.”

“He doesn’t flip like the toy, though. He comes down the wall the same, but his face never stops looking at me. He just bends. Like this-”

He begins moving his fingers like a spider moving down a spout, but I stop him.

“Enough!” I warn him “Bedtime. Right now. You’re being silly, scaring yourself!”

I hate bedtimes like this, but tough love sometimes is the only thing that’ll do for Ben. I give him another kiss and murmur a goodnight.

I head back out to the hall, and a sudden rage fills my being as the splash of the loungeroom TV light illuminates a brand-new set of grubby, climbing man wall marks. If I wasn’t so enraged, I’d almost be impressed how high they were thrown. Far higher, I suddenly realized, then Ben could ever throw. A little larger, than what his toy could mark.

I turn around to get the light, but my hand never makes it to the switch. It is frozen, suspended, as I stare down to the end of the hallway.

It looks at me. It extends both black spindly legs, folding in on itself, moving down the hallway ceiling. Its head never moves, keeping its eyes on me. Every time it moves, there is a strange creaking and crackling. It keeps on smiling- a clownish, cartoonish smile. It is then I realize how fast it is.

It is then I realize, there are no doorframes to run behind from this end of the hall."
qszwj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qszwj7/a_secondhand_portrait/,A Secondhand Portrait,154,11,1636804987.0,"I found her at a yard sale earlier this year, and she kind of spoke to me, you know?

She was an old oil painting. A portrait of a young woman wearing an old-fashioned gown, and her hair’s done up in ringlets. Her eyes are what caught my attention: they were the palest shade of blue I’d ever seen, nearly colorless. Anyway, she hangs in my living room, watching over the place, and in a weird way it’s almost like it’s her house now, too. 

I talk to her sometimes. It’s a funny thing, living alone. Victoria left not long after I brought the painting home. I thought she understood, but she didn’t. So now it’s just me. More accurately, the oil painting and I.

The first night it happened I didn’t know what to think. It was kind of a nightmare, but more like a dream. The girl with the pale eyes slipped out of the portrait on the wall, and walked right into my bedroom. 

It began happening more and more frequently, and one day it culminated in watching her crawl out of the confines of the frame, and into reality before my very eyes. Her footsteps sounded wet as she walked up to me, almost like she was walking through wet paint. And suddenly I wasn’t so lonely, any more.

I didn’t think that she could leave.

That was my second mistake.

I hadn’t been feeling well, less and less so over the course of the past few weeks. One afternoon I woke up from a nap and saw her coming through the front door, carrying groceries. “I bought you chicken noodle soup,” she said. It was very sweet of her to do so, but more than a little odd.

The weaker I grew, the stronger she seemed to blend into her surroundings. Once she looked like a painting come to life. Presently she looks just like a real human being.

Which leads me to my third, and ultimate, mistake.

Last night I went to bed feeling awful beyond words. I was convinced I needed a doctor, to which she said I would feel better in the morning. So off to sleep I went, only to wake up here, in this strange room. There’s a journal on the table, and I presume it belongs to her. I’m writing in it now, for I fear the worst is happening, and I want to prevent it if I can. 

There’s one window, and when I look out of it, I can see my own living room. The girl with the pale eyes stops and looks in at me, and with a creeping sense of numbness, of unease, realization dawns.

She’s talking to someone else, someone I can’t see, and when I hear her say it, it’s just barely: “I think it’s time for some spring cleaning, darling. How about a yard sale?”"

It was the end of summer for Jin. For she was already tired of the activities she had done in the long summer, that she didn’t want to go in the woods. All her friends were waiting for her to come down from her window on the first floor. But she dragged herself down anyway for the sake of those happy faces.

“So, let’s go guys”, she said, by gathering energy and half-spiritedly. 

”Let’s head back, we’ll be late anyhow, you don’t want to make it later” she commanded midway.

On the way back everyone kept quiet and let the soft air touch their faces. Suddenly one of them burst into action and ran toward the foot of an old tree. He pointed out a clay doll that lay in the crevices of its roots. The mobile flashlight had fallen on the doll and that’s how he observed.

“Hey! What the hell do you think you are doing? Don’t touch it” Jin shouted at the boy, as he removed the doll from its place. Jin sprung and grabbed the doll from him.”How dare you do it.”Jin rebuked him, pressing the doll hard, unconsciously. She placed it back swiftly and then all of them walked silently to their houses. Jin always said: ’we shouldn’t do things even if we don’t believe them’.

Jin was disturbed by the fact that the doll was wet and had been placed freshly. She hadn’t seen it previously, while entering.

Everyone started dancing and jumping, with the sudden downpour. Jin enjoyed at first, but then she walked under shelter of a tree. 

She wiped her face and her hands slipped off her face. She looked at her hands and it was all clayey, *there was no clay around her.* She opened her selfie camera and saw her face. It was distorted in the direction of her hands wiping, creating a mound of clay and her skin near her eyes. Her eyebrows withered away as she kept looking, huge piles of her wig started falling. Her face structure was dented and finger marks were over it. She tried, to fix her face, *the force broke her fingers.* The phone then slipped away from her muddy, other hand that eventually crumbled away. She tried to scream and run. The voice never came out, but she was able to run. Wet clay dripped all the way till she reached her staircase; she slipped before she could climb up.

*“Splat!”*  And the clay flew everywhere with a sudden squish and all of Jin lay on staircase in clayey form until the rain washed it away after sometime. The pool created by the clay was blue, white, light-brown and grey. Blue and white the colour of her, now yolky eyes; the lens inside remained intact though. The light-brown, colour of her skin now mixed with lots of grayness of clay.

*It rained all night and the night saw a delirious stranger visiting, who collected all the clay for her new doll.*"
qsxxs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qsxxs4/parfum_de_la_mort/,Parfum de la Mort,88,6,1636796619.0,"Mrs Wallow was an odd one out, standing out like a shadow in a field of light. She was cloaked in black, her gown falling at her heels. Her sallow skin was weighed down with all the sins of the world, creased and wrinkled all over.
 
Her eyes scanned the counters and shelves. She was hoping for a new perfume today, so she could at least *smell* nice. But everyone else shielded their gaze from her, and moved away when she came near, like she had some sort of contagious disease.
 
Except for one. The salesgirl, young and fresh and with horns on her head, looked at her with bright, fox-like eyes.
 
When Mrs Wallow finally came to her, she did not back down. Instead she smiled brightly, and said, “I got the perfect perfume for you!”
 
She reached under the counter and brought out a shimmering crystal bottle. The liquid inside was pink and smelled of roses.
 
“This perfume will bring out the beauty within you!” the salesgirl declared. “Just spray it on and leave it for the night. It will work wonders!”
 
“I want it…” Mrs Wallow breathed, drooling like a pack of slobbering dogs.
 
“Done.” smiled the salesgirl, handing over the bottle.
 
***
 
Mrs Wallow never felt more *alive* when she woke up the next morning after spraying on the perfume the night before. It was like she had woken up from the best spa massage.
 
She looked into the mirror. Mrs Wallow gasped.
 
A model was staring back at her. She had a crystal-clear complexion and silky-smooth skin. She had baby eyes framed with long eyelashes.
 
Mrs Wallow touched her face in disbelief. But it was real. It was all real.
 
Everybody’s jaw dropped when she emerged from her house. They couldn’t keep their eyes off her.
 
Everybody greeted her as she sashayed down the street. Men abandoned their wives and boyfriends and followed her around. There were soon so many people following her that you might think she was the biggest celebrity that ever lived.
 
At first Mrs Wallow loved the attention. 
 
But then she realised nobody would *leave her alone.*
 
Everywhere she turned there would be *someone* in the corner, drooling over her. They looked absolutely disgusting, and frankly it was making her sick.
 
The crowd was getting worse now, so close they were practically breathing down her neck. Before long they formed a wall that blocked out the sun. Then, on top of her.
 
Mrs Wallow was paralyzed under their weight, and she could only watch helplessly as they tore out chunks of her flesh with their teeth. They drank her blood like fine wine. Their yellow teeth were splattered with red.
 
“Get off me!” Mrs Wallow tried to moan, but her shouts were drowned out by chants of:
 
“But you *smell* so delicious!”"
qsxwvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/qsxwvo/my_mother_has_been_a_bit_depressed_since_she_had/,My mother has been a bit depressed since she had my baby brother,1212,23,1636796507.0,"My parents had me (15f) very young and I knew they struggled originally as they weren't prepared for having a child. They did try their best and I love them for it. They both had to give up a lot to raise me.

I was originally delighted when my parents announced their pregnancy as they were so happy. I knew they wanted the chance to raise another child and give me a sibling.

The pregnancy was hard on my mom as her morning sickness was really severe. She had to quit her job due to a number of issues with the pregnancy. It was obvious that she was struggling and I tried my best to help her out as often as I could.

I know that she sometimes struggles with depression so me and my dad kept reminding her that she would be a mother again. She tried to look happy but I could see she was faking it.

When my baby brother Adam was brought back to the hospital, her depresssion just got worse. She kept telling everyone that she was going a bit crazy as she kept hearing Adam talk to her in her head. My bedroom was turned into a nursery for Adam and I was moved into the smaller guestroom.

Today I walked into the room to find my mother holding a pillow over Adam's cold lifeless body. I screamed for my father and his face went deathly pale as he saw my mother standing there. She kept claiming Adam told her to do it and that now he was finally free.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I watched my mother being led to the police car. I could see my father calmly explaining to the officer what had happened. I took the opportunity to sneak into the playroom and remove the hidden speakers from the teddy bear. I glanced around the room and couldn't wait to move back in as my mother had finally gotten rid of Adam for me"
