hkkxv81,t3_qtmllk,"# PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:

It is that time of year when many of us gather together with loved ones to celebrate that time-honored traditional holiday of Thanksgiving.

We'll commiserate and reminisce at the table as we gobble up moist, tender turkey. We'll wolf down heaping spoonfuls of mashed-potatoes slathered with rich, dripping gravy. We'll indulge in decadent pies of pumpkin and apple, and we'll gorge ourselves silly until we succumb to the post-meal nap.

Sadly, there are many out there who aren't quite so fortunate and will go hungry this year.

For a small gift of $1.99, you can help to provide a decent meal this holiday season to a pitiful and lonesome werewolf. For the price of a cup of coffee, you'll ensure that one neglected werewolf will sleep with a full tummy this Thanksgiving.

Your gift will provide a tasty homeless vagrant to a werewolf in need. You'll be provided a picture of your sponsored werewolf as they dine upon a hapless street-bum that we've prepared for them.

Our street-bums have been thoroughly bathed, free of the reeking stench of Olde English Malt Liquor, and they've been generously tenderized by our professional team of retired MMA athletes, who've pummeled them until they're pliable.

So please, consider donating only $1.99 today, and feed an unfortunate werewolf. Your gift is tax-deductible and greatly appreciated.",t3_qtmllk

hkkpd51,t3_qtmllk,"Finally satiated. What's that feel like? How long until you'll have to feast again? It's said that long pig is really addictive. Although I think most of us like it cooked, rare but cooked nonetheless.",t3_qtmllk
