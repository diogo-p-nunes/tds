hpa16em,t3_rkjmer,"If you like this and/or are a fan of any of my work, then please help to support me by buying my new book on Amazon, it's affordable and full of great horror short stories. I am trying to pursue a career in writing so I would really appreciate any support you can give. And if you buy it, let me know! and let me know what you think of it. I will be selling it for a discounted price for a short time, so if you are interested, I would buy it quickly. Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day.
