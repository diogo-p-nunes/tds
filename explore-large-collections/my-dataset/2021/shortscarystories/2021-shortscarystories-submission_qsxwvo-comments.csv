hkfyn03,t3_qsxwvo,Surprising twist. Cool.,t3_qsxwvo
hkgb5xj,t3_qsxwvo,"Another amazing story, I honestly think you may be one of my favourite authors on this site ðŸ™‚

I honestly thought the mother was having dangerous delusions brought on by mental illness, but learning the truth, and the unbelievable reason behind that truth, was something else. Well, I suppose now the daughter can get her larger room back, because with her mother presumably now being locked up for a very long time, I can't see any more baby brothers or sisters coming along to ruin her living plans... ðŸ˜¶

There is just one thing confusing me though. The dad. Was he aware of/in on his daughter's evil plan, or did he believe the surface story of delusions?

Either way, another brilliant read, loved it ðŸ™‚",t3_qsxwvo
