hncvuzo,t3_r9aucm,Why wasn't I prepared for that ending?! Oh my!,t3_r9aucm
hneeq2f,t3_r9aucm,"Wild turn at the end, I didn't see that happening! I would note that the womb, the uterus, returns to a size of about 9 cm (3.5 in) when not pregnant, so finding it would be alright, but it might be snug for a head. A human body cavity could do quite nicely though. Keep up the good work!",t3_r9aucm

hnefsk6,t1_hneeq2f,"Thank you very much for your comment! I'm glad you liked the story.

I should say that regardless how big/small the womb is, it's always worth to at least make an attempt to squeeze in. Even if the success is not possible in full, it's nice to at least feel the familiar smell and warmth of the place that served as your home for several happy months!",t3_r9aucm
