hln5wop,t3_qz202e,It seems Bryan is taking this game a bit too seriously,t3_qz202e
hlk0me3,t3_qz202e,"The idea of the story is great! 

If you don't mind me giving a tip. try not to repeat some words as much. For example, instead of saying ""Brian said no"" try saying: ""yet Brian told me no"" etc. It makes it a little easier to read. 

Overall it's a great story",t3_qz202e
