hm64n69,t3_r2lhct,I didn‚Äôt look at the subreddit before I read this and just assumed it was one of the entitled parent subreddits I followed and when I say I went ‚ÄúHUH?!‚Äù out loud at the end lmao,t3_r2lhct
hm5hzok,t3_r2lhct,üòÜ yeah!,t3_r2lhct
hm5ypg6,t3_r2lhct,Happy Black Friday and belated Thanksgiving! I love the story,t3_r2lhct
hm6tzkh,t3_r2lhct,I really should check the sub before I read. I honestly thought it was in an entitled sub. You got me goooood!,t3_r2lhct
hm59t8y,t3_r2lhct,"Happy Black Friday everyone! Have fun shopping!

Just don‚Äôt be a Karen. No one likes Karen‚Äôs. Be nice!

Happy Black Friday and remember *live, laugh, love*!",t3_r2lhct
hm6jg05,t3_r2lhct,"i saw the title of this and even though the subreddit name hadn't loaded in yet, i knew EXACTLY what subreddit this was (i've come to expect most of these types of stories to be sss) and i had a huge grin on my face when i read it (cause it's clever)

i haven't seen any ""entitled parent horror story thingy"" type of story on here yet, so you get points for originality!",t3_r2lhct
hm6xtb0,t3_r2lhct,awesome... I think everyone in retail knows the pain of dealing with difficult customers,t3_r2lhct
hm7hn58,t3_r2lhct,Now that was a fun read,t3_r2lhct
hm8b31i,t3_r2lhct,I got confused bc I literally just unsubscribed from entitled parents yesterday lol,t3_r2lhct

hm7sgf1,t3_r2lhct,"I rely a lot on subreddit colors to tell what I‚Äôm reading on I really thought this was just an entitled parents story, killer job my friend!",t3_r2lhct
hm8nq93,t3_r2lhct,The writing style here was perfect and I love how you captured the narrator's voice! I could seriously feel MC's exasperation oozing through the screen XD.,t3_r2lhct
hm8s40s,t3_r2lhct,"Love the concept but the Karen seemed a little too cartoonish and not believable. Case in point, I forgot what subreddit I was on and assumed the OP was lying for effect.",t3_r2lhct
hm89gue,t3_r2lhct,",.",t3_r2lhct
hm8imjm,t3_r2lhct,Smart idea. Another sub merges with another,t3_r2lhct
hm91tzx,t3_r2lhct,you aren‚Äôt the asshole- you helped us kill another Karen :D,t3_r2lhct
hm9bb9r,t3_r2lhct,You are a hero!,t3_r2lhct
hm9cmls,t3_r2lhct,You could make a small fortune selling those clay Karen dolls to the service industry.,t3_r2lhct
hm9dig5,t3_r2lhct,"NTA your needles, your rules",t3_r2lhct
hm9dzqs,t3_r2lhct,"> K (holding up the Switch): Your Switch is faulty. I DEMAND a new replacement immediately.

> Me: Ma‚Äôam. I saw your son CLEARLY broke it. Cameras can prove it. We can get you a new one, but you must pay for BOTH Switches.

> K: My little angel DIDN‚ÄôT break anything! GIVE ME A NEW ONE FOR FREE RIGHT NOW!

You almost had me, except for this section. The language doesn‚Äôt sound quite natural, like it‚Äôs being spoken aloud. It‚Äôs small, little idiosyncrasies that give it away. May I suggest next time reading the spoken portions aloud, it can help you identify awkward phrasing.",t3_r2lhct
hm9jguf,t3_r2lhct,nta Karen‚Äôs suck,t3_r2lhct
hm9jnp0,t3_r2lhct,Very good ‚Ä¶ good job keep it up!!!,t3_r2lhct
hmc3v68,t3_r2lhct,"Wait, Karen and Dlyan were actually impaled by needles instead of just feeling sharp pains and *then* dying?

Damn, I need to use clay sculptures. They sound *way* cooler than voodoo dolls!",t3_r2lhct
hm65rsz,t1_hm64n69,"I lurk a lot in the entitled people subreddits, so I was semi-familiar with how to word these things, but it is so drastically different from my usual writing style lol.

Though I also drew from experience working in service during my internship, and a few people were rather *interesting*.

Thanks for reading!",t3_r2lhct
hm6hp96,t1_hm64n69,"I thought it was talesfromretail and thought the ending of it was just someone venting/joking, didn't even realize it wasn't until I scrolled down to the comments to read other people complaining about their experiences - ope, no, different sub",t3_r2lhct
hm65roh,t1_hm64n69,that's awesome!,t3_r2lhct

Happy Black Friday to you as well!",t3_r2lhct
hm8wqi9,t1_hm6gum9,Agreed. For most customer-facing workers this isn't scary at all; it's almost wholesome.,t3_r2lhct
