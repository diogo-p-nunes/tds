hmhbhzd,t3_r4g4xd,"I LOVE THIS, I haven't read a story recently that's actually scary but also surprising.

I thought he was gonna be stuck in there forever, but the way he said the 'Hey man' line took me out of it a little because it sounds like the character has a flat affect, it might just be the lack of a question mark though LOL

It's cool that he didn't just get stuck in there forever because that's the obvious choice , this was actually scary omg",t3_r4g4xd
