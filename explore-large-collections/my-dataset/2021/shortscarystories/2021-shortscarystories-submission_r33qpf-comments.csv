hma068e,t3_r33qpf,So good OP. I love that he doesn't know what's keeping him rooted to the house.,t3_r33qpf
hm8uukn,t3_r33qpf,VERY cool,t3_r33qpf
hm8ljqs,t3_r33qpf,Wow the ending really surprised me! Didn‚Äôt see it coming at all. Great story!,t3_r33qpf
hm8r3cn,t3_r33qpf,S‚Äôthere gonna be a part 2 to this?,t3_r33qpf
hm9dmqj,t3_r33qpf,Haunt that bitch,t3_r33qpf
hm8zrop,t3_r33qpf,"Wow, I didn't see that twist coming! I actually had to go and reread the story. The hints you dropped and foreshadowing was so clever and subtle. I thoroughly enjoyed this!",t3_r33qpf
hmam59j,t3_r33qpf,"I was wondering why they were all living together...

Great story btw",t3_r33qpf
hmbb4mw,t3_r33qpf,Loved this! This has to be one of the best of this type of story I've read for a while. Well done my friend.,t3_r33qpf
hm93lty,t3_r33qpf,I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve understood this or not. Is the guy a ghost and the ashes are his? I don‚Äôt get how Brian fits into it or the food (which I‚Äôm assuming is actually human meat).,t3_r33qpf
hmaki9r,t3_r33qpf,"I guessed from the start that he was probably a ghost, but I didn‚Äôt guess her involvement! Nice!",t3_r33qpf
hm970lv,t3_r33qpf,Great work!,t3_r33qpf
hm9b2h5,t3_r33qpf,Amazing story. Great work!,t3_r33qpf
hm9uu9t,t3_r33qpf,Very well done!,t3_r33qpf
hm9va6p,t3_r33qpf,"Very well done! 
The end especially, as always. 
üòÅüëå",t3_r33qpf
hm9x6bg,t3_r33qpf,Love it!,t3_r33qpf
hma9rb0,t3_r33qpf,Love this!!,t3_r33qpf
hmav3kn,t3_r33qpf,"Wow, that was fantastic!",t3_r33qpf
hmawbma,t3_r33qpf,"At least you know they‚Äôre going to live unhappily ever after. Sometimes it‚Äôs not deliberate revenge but just keeping on that brings justice,",t3_r33qpf
hme7avc,t3_r33qpf,"I love how innocent he is, so sad and so sweet. Thank you for the good read.",t3_r33qpf
hma0ub4,t1_hma068e,"Thanks! Yeah, he's clueless. I really feel for the guy...gotta be hard to ""live"" in that situation.",t3_r33qpf
hm8n6n3,t1_hm8ljqs,Awesome! I'm always thrilled when I'm able to pull that off on this crowd. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment.,t3_r33qpf
hm9xrqg,t1_hm8r3cn,"There will not be. As Simba mentioned, there's a policy against it. I kind of enjoy that policy, tbh, 'cause I plain stink at sequels. Thanks for reading!",t3_r33qpf
hm8txzz,t1_hm8r3cn,Sequels are not allowed in this sub.,t3_r33qpf
hm9tm3l,t1_hm8zrop,I'm always happy when that works out. It's a fine balance on whether the story will be too obvious or obscure. Thanks for reading!,t3_r33qpf
hmann44,t1_hmam59j,"Thanks! I imagine it would be super awkward if they were all alive. A good sitcom, maybe?",t3_r33qpf
hmbdzb6,t1_hmbb4mw,Very kind of you. Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_r33qpf
hm94gjd,t1_hm93lty,"Christina poisoned him so she could date Brian in peace. He died, she buried his ashes in the yard. That's my understanding.",t3_r33qpf
hm94pu7,t1_hm93lty,I took it to understand that the narrator was poisoned by his wife. And he was killed so wife and Brian could get married.,t3_r33qpf
hm9tdn0,t1_hm93lty,"You're right about the ghost and ashes part. The steak was just steak though, with a little something deadly added. Brian (let's spell his name ""Brain"" because it will annoy him to no end) is the new man. Thanks for reading!",t3_r33qpf
hm9si8l,t1_hm9b2h5,Thanks! Glad you liked it.,t3_r33qpf
hm9vfzl,t1_hm9va6p,"Thanks, Chicki! Glad you liked it.",t3_r33qpf
hmbf3k6,t1_hmawbma,"That's a good point. He doesn't treat her very well, does he? It's probably just because he's scared, but whatever. Justice will be served one way or another.",t3_r33qpf
hm9mku7,t1_hm8txzz,"Thank fuck for that. I know it's disappointing to want more of good writing, but I am tired of nosleep being just neverending sequels",t3_r33qpf
hm8tzyk,t1_hm8txzz,"Ah, I see.",t3_r33qpf
hmanr9t,t1_hmann44,Yeah lol,t3_r33qpf
hmaze6u,t1_hm9mku7,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Some Scary Stuff: Part 47 - Who‚Äôs Still Fucking Reading This?‚Äù,t3_r33qpf
hmb3egg,t1_hm9mku7,"The only one I've ever followed from start to finish was the campground manager series by fainting_goat. You should check it out see if it might be of interest. 

I started this other one too - about the oceans being a killer rainforest instead. I lost track though. It was pretty good also",t3_r33qpf
hmb3b7c,t1_hmaze6u,Yeah I'm sick of that too.,t3_r33qpf
hmb7imx,t1_hmb3egg,I highly recommend the Left Right game and anything by /u/bloodstains,t3_r33qpf
hmb7j7d,t1_hmb3egg,I highly recommend the Left Right game and anything by /u/bloodstains,t3_r33qpf
hmbhoxn,t1_hmb7j7d,"Hey, thanks! Looking forward to reading that one",t3_r33qpf
