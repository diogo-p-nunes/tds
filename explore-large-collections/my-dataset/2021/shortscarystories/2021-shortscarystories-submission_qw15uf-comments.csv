hkztpkh,t3_qw15uf,"Had this crazy idea of talking turkeys, especially after reading a [poem by Benjamin Zephaniah](https://benjaminzephaniah.com/books/talking-turkeys/) which had been published in a poetry book I had as a kid, and [another story here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/5dnavm/the_presidential_pardon_of_the_national/)by u/cold--cocoon. My two main inspirations for this crazy, weird poem.

As always, feedback is very welcome! Come to r/SimbaKingdom for more stuff by me, and [SUBSCRIBE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&subject=Subscribe&message=SubscribeMe%21%20%2Fr%2Fshortscarystories%20%2Fu%2FSimbaTheSavage8) for more stuff straight from my head.

Have a nice day!",t3_qw15uf

This actually reminds me that I used to know an evil turkey, sort of...he had a massive attitude problem and all the other birds, even his lady friend, gave him a wide berth and even his owner was too scared to approach him without holding a long stick to defend himself 😶

Great work again, I was unnerved but amused at the prospect of the turkeys getting revenge for many years of slaughter for traditional meals. I'll be sure to keep a wary eye out for them nearer the time 🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃",t3_qw15uf
