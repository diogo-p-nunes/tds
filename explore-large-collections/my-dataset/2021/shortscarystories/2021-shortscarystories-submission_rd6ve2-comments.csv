hnzhgyl,t3_rd6ve2,"ouch. honestly, i would offer my arm to my cat, if i had one.

also, when you mentioned moshi monsters i immediately went spiralling down into my primary school memories. i never played the game (for some reason) but EVERYONE around me did. primary school is a sad period of life i’d rather not remember.",t3_rd6ve2
hnz638d,t3_rd6ve2,"*This story is part of my Video Game Collection, an anthology of stories based on my favourite video games. Inspired by u/hyperobscura’s album collection!*

**Inspired by: Moshi Monsters**

Moshi Monsters was **the** hottest game when I was a kid. Practically everybody in school had an account, and about half of those people have the paid membership. My sisters and I were big Moshi Monster fans too. We had the trading cards, the accounts, and everything.

When Moshi Monsters Rewritten came out, it felt like I was experiencing my childhood all over again…

**How It Inspired The Story**

At its core, Moshi Monsters is about taking care of your own lovable pet monster. But realistically, monsters are dangerous creatures. Unreliable even. No matter how much love you shower it, it is still a wild thing…

hnzl8ur,t3_rd6ve2,"i loved moshi monsters! my heart broke when it got taken down, i loved playing the moshi missions and doing all the chores in my house so my parents would buy me a membership card lol very good memories, also this story was great :3",t3_rd6ve2
ho01yjx,t3_rd6ve2,"I think this is an incredibly fun twist on famous games and would love to see more! 

However, for some reason I decided this was going to be about Puss in Boots from Shrek so you know if you ever need new ideas...",t3_rd6ve2

hnzimmu,t1_hnzhgyl,"Yeah, there were people playing Moshi Monsters in the school library in primary school. Like having a membership was the norm.

And I’m sorry to have brought up bad memories. Here’s a hug.",t3_rd6ve2

hnzo6gj,t1_hnzl8ur,"There’s Moshi Monsters Rewritten, which is a fan made recreation of the original Moshi Monsters. I’ll DM you the link!

And thank you!",t3_rd6ve2
ho069bd,t1_ho05lt0,Thank you!,t3_rd6ve2
ho7ksiu,t1_ho6v181,"Yup, it’s **hungry**!",t3_rd6ve2
hnzllqk,t1_hnzimmu,"I've never played, is it like pokemon?",t3_rd6ve2
hnznxsh,t1_hnzllqk,"No, in Moshi Monsters you take care of one of 6 monsters, by feeding it and keeping it happy. You earn Rox, the in-game currency by playing mini games or solving puzzles to buy furniture to decorate your monster’s room. There’s also Moshi Missions, which are basically story-based quests for you to complete with your monster.

It’s a lot more relaxed than Pokémon, which has a strategic, RPG element to it. There’s a lot going on in Moshi Monsters that I can’t put into words, so I’ll DM you the link to Moshi Monsters Rewritten, which is a fan made recreation of the original Moshi Monsters, which closed down in 2019. Make an account, adopt a monster, and enjoy the game!",t3_rd6ve2
ho07y4y,t1_hnznxsh,OMG! Thank you so much! It's a better tomagochi! (Probably spelled it wrong) this sounds like such a cool game. Having a pet monster. Thank you again for the info and the DM so I can play too. You're cooler and cooler everytime I talk to ya.,t3_rd6ve2
