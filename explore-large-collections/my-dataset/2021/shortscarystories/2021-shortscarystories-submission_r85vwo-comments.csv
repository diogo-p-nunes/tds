hn3tkse,t3_r85vwo,As a 52 yr old horror fan and avid horror book collector (just over 4000 books) why arent your works in book print? Clive Barker's books of blood are pure class and he is my hero....and I'd buy your book of short horror stories cos I know I'd be getting my money's worth. I take off my hat to you Hyper and I bow...well done sir,t3_r85vwo

If you haven‚Äôt already, I‚Äôd love it if you pop on over and check it out! All you need to do is drop me a comment with your favorite album(s) of 2021, and you‚Äôre in the running for some cool prizes.

**HYPER‚ÄôS TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#10:** Misotheist - For the Glory of Your Redeemer

**Genre:** Black Metal

I‚Äôd probably be exiled in a heartbeat if I didn‚Äôt add at least one Norwegian artist to my AotY, but this particular one would have slithered into it regardless of nationality. It‚Äôs raw, brutal, filthy, blasphemous, anti-everything, but also surprisingly melodic in parts.

This one took a while to crawl under my skin, but when it first did, it sprouted tooth-like appendages, burrowed into my flesh, cocooning now in my innards all snug and tidy, awaiting the day Misotheist drops a new pvre evil banger to purge my system.

The story was inspired by the sonic embodiment of hate I felt throughout this album, and I realised quite early on that I wanted a religious theme to it. Crucifixion seemed the obvious choice, and everything else just sort of fell into place after that.

**Album Rating:** 646/666",t3_r85vwo
