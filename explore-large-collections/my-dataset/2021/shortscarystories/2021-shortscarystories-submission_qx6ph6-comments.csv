hl7jxbo,t3_qx6ph6,True love.,t3_qx6ph6
hl8can4,t3_qx6ph6,Beautifully written and left me wanting more...the description of what was after them sounds bloody horendous and where it was from/what is its purpose needs another story. Well done,t3_qx6ph6
hl890tu,t3_qx6ph6,This story unfolded beautifully.,t3_qx6ph6
hl8s9sg,t3_qx6ph6,The monster you created with your imagination now lives in mine. That description was absolutely wet-your-pants terrifyingly dreadful!,t3_qx6ph6
hl91obq,t3_qx6ph6,"You have created a creature that I believe is the most terrifying thing since creepypasta began. I'm not calling this a creepypasta(unless it is, I don't know sometimes) I'm just referring to some of the ungodly things that comes from it.

The story was amazingly written. I felt the bond they had. The fear built up inside me as the story unfolded. I really hope you write more about this monster. Thank you for sharing your imagination and talent.",t3_qx6ph6
hl86tmz,t3_qx6ph6,"wow, this was great...nicely written. I really loved this,awesome readüëç",t3_qx6ph6

hla0bxn,t3_qx6ph6,"This is absolutely stunning!! Horrific descriptions, packed with emotions, great work!",t3_qx6ph6
hlasl5h,t3_qx6ph6,"wow, the description of the thing after them is so unsettling. this story is really somber and unnerving.",t3_qx6ph6
hlc1ow7,t3_qx6ph6,"I was picturing the woman as pregnant cause when it said about her ankle, I thought about how pregnant people get swollen ankles. So that made it even more sad for me",t3_qx6ph6
hlchdqt,t3_qx6ph6,This is one the best written stories I‚Äôve seen on this sub! God I love it so much. Immediately from the beginning it kinda gave me A Quiet Place/Bird Box vibes haha,t3_qx6ph6
hlhfp73,t3_qx6ph6,"This needs more upvotes, tragic and well written",t3_qx6ph6
hlp8ydh,t3_qx6ph6,This was beautiful!,t3_qx6ph6
hl94gl4,t3_qx6ph6,"Why did she have to die, though? 

Great story, I was just wondering if a bullet could stop it, 2 would have been even better",t3_qx6ph6
hl7rhq1,t1_hl7r9kv,Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it,t3_qx6ph6
hl7u0d3,t1_hl7trpt,It was a rough one.,t3_qx6ph6
hl8pv17,t1_hl8can4,Thank you!,t3_qx6ph6
hl8tikj,t1_hl8s9sg,This is cool to hear. I've always wanted to have my own creepy folklore monster.,t3_qx6ph6
hl942ww,t1_hl91obq,Thank you for such kind words and genuine feedback. It was originally just supposed to be a story of dark suspense but it has had a much more positive response than I expected. I will continue this legacy in the future in a more lengthy tale if people wish to see more of this monster. I greatly appreciate it. Thank you for reading!,t3_qx6ph6
hl8pqxj,t1_hl8fhfz,Thank you,t3_qx6ph6
hl8xoii,t1_hl8x4js,Thank you for taking the time to read it! Glad you liked it.,t3_qx6ph6
hla31oy,t1_hla0bxn,Thank you very much!,t3_qx6ph6
hlclbqc,t1_hlchdqt,Thank you so much! Happy you enjoyed it,t3_qx6ph6
hlhga1q,t1_hlhfp73,Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_qx6ph6
hlp92ih,t1_hlp8ydh,Thank you!,t3_qx6ph6
hl9dfih,t1_hl94gl4,"He killed her so she wouldn't have her face taken. He didn't want her to have that fate like the others. At least this way, she died intact and without horror. Dignity.",t3_qx6ph6
hl9dvk1,t1_hl94gl4,Where do you think the other bullets went? Even in a revolver there are 6 (if I‚Äôm not mistaken),t3_qx6ph6
hl9ypwt,t1_hl7rhq1,"It would be perfect for a  Saint Valentine's sss contest. Not that I mind reading it earlier of course. You put together love, courage, dignity, death and horror in a great way.",t3_qx6ph6
hld2f9b,t1_hla31oy,No problem!,t3_qx6ph6
hlg0at9,t1_hl9dvk1,"I just thought maybe he had shot at the creature that steals faces trying to kill it, just to find out that he can‚Äôt kill it.",t3_qx6ph6
hl9f7cv,t1_hl9dvk1,"I was going under the impression it was the last 2 bullets in the gun. If they had been on the run and already lost 8 people, it stands to reason the other bullets may have been used in self defense? 

*shrug*",t3_qx6ph6
hl9yyhv,t1_hl9ypwt,Thanks! I'll keep that in mind for next time.,t3_qx6ph6
hl9jhhv,t1_hl9f7cv,It‚Äôs clear there was only one left though.,t3_qx6ph6
