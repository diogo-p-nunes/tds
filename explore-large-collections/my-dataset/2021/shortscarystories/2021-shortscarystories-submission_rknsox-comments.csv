Strong contender for my favorite shortscarystories line of the year.",t3_rknsox
hpamxxn,t3_rknsox,"Um. Death to the one and only Obese elf, I guess. Pregolas, maybe…like preg-legolas. Anyway, stay safe and Happy Monday.

Edit: nothing wrong with being full figured, but Santa got his weight the wrong way. It rhymes with ‘Hannibalism.’",t3_rknsox
hpc9ary,t3_rknsox,"This was an epic read. 2 👍. 

But I need to ask a clarity question that might get me down voted into oblivion. 

Does this kid think Santa is God? He talks about the holiday, and the legendary jingle bell line, but then blames Santa for covid and the deaths of his parents? Or is he assuming Santa brought those as ""presents"" because of the time of year?

BTW, I also loved the title.",t3_rknsox
hpblczs,t3_rknsox,I love this story \^\^. It's wonderful to read,t3_rknsox
hpblrz7,t3_rknsox,"Santa meanwhile is just laughing. ""I know if you've been BAD or good - You think I can't see murder attempts from a mile away? Next year, I'll give you coal. HO HO HO AND SHOVE IT!""",t3_rknsox
hpbv98k,t3_rknsox,A lot like Sam Kills Christmas. Love it!,t3_rknsox

hpazu7d,t1_hpazgh7,😅 I went for a vibe.,t3_rknsox
hpcp5bw,t1_hpc9ary,Much more ridiculous than all that. Santa just had Covid.  He brought it around in 2020. King of the vectors—a man who enters every quarantined home. Thanks for the read! 🙃,t3_rknsox
hpct1i6,t1_hpc9ary,Santa had covid and brought it into his house on christmas,t3_rknsox
hpb7bro,t1_hpazu7d,And you succeeded!,t3_rknsox
hpddm3f,t1_hpcp5bw,I don't know why but that idea completely escaped me.🤭🤭,t3_rknsox
hpcwxa8,t1_hpct1i6,My head so totally did not go there. Thank you!,t3_rknsox
hpddy5s,t1_hpddm3f,"I’ve seen a lot of depictions of Santa, but I can’t think of a single one where he’s thoroughly washing his hands. SMH",t3_rknsox
