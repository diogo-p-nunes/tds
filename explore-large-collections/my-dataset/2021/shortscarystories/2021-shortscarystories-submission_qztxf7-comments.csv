Seriously though, in a general sense I suppose the story is about religious people who interpret 'signs' in extreme ways.

The protagonist for example was so desperate for any sort of guidance that he actually got some, and he used that 'guidance' in a way that destroyed himself, but because he thinks that he did what God asked of him he's tricked himself into a state of delusional contentment. Now he's a slug man, ""sliding"" everywhere. 

I don't know, I wrote it in under 15 minutes, this is the best explanation I have.",t3_qztxf7
