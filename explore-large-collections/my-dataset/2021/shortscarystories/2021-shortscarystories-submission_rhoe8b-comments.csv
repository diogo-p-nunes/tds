hoshi4j,t3_rhoe8b,"I am not a doctor, but this sounds like sleep paralysis. It can result in hallucinations, breathing difficulties and a sense of pressure on the chest. Must be terrifying, but luckily it's a natural phenomenon, if this is the case. 
Anyway, sleep paralysis or not, I am sorry for your bad experience OP.
