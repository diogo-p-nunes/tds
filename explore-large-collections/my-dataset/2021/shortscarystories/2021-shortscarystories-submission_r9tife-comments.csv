hne9426,t3_r9tife,I‚Äôve had this idea rattling around in my head for a while now. Imagine if the night sky was full of messages in a language we do not understand.,t3_r9tife
hnexvqf,t3_r9tife,"I didn‚Äôt find it clich√© at all. The idea something so beautiful, vast, and unending (the stars)being a willful torment made by an unknown entity (w/e deity you believe in) was an awesome idea! Only part I agree on is I wish it was longer bc it‚Äôs such a great concept that could be explored in so many ways. Great job",t3_r9tife
hneha5d,t3_r9tife,"I've always liked that idea, of some being who created the illusion of God, great history, I'd love to read more from you.",t3_r9tife
hnfqxtg,t3_r9tife,Even unknown entities do a little bit of trolling from time to time,t3_r9tife
hnfp5bp,t3_r9tife,The people have spoken...more please! You could really do the story more justice if you were to add more depth to the story and build more tension along the way.,t3_r9tife
hnhoqp2,t3_r9tife,that was such a good read ur very talented.üíØüëçüåü‚ú®,t3_r9tife
hnedha8,t3_r9tife,"Little bit confused here, so there is a universal being that tricked humans to believing a god, but then why go and kill yourself? Also doesn't make sense for other religions but it's probably my logical brain overreacting. 

I like it though, but definitely felt it could have been written a little bit longer and better. For example, I find the twist a little bit clich√©, it could have been something existential and more dreadful than ""I tricked you in believing a god"".

Still, fun little story. Would definitely read again if OP decides to extend the story.",t3_r9tife
hngbjw4,t3_r9tife,"Had me for a second, didn‚Äôt quite stick the landing, most astrophysicists are atheists anyway and I am also going to school to be an astrophysicist, and because of the ever expanding universe, stars and nebulas and galaxies are being pulled away from us. Also new star systems (solar systems) are being formed every second, so stars are still being born. Also I would like to apologize, I am a nerd and feel the need to correct people when they get things wrong about the cosmos. So I‚Äôm sorry if it sounds like I was bashing it, it was good, up until the ending, as an atheist, the idea of a god not existing isn‚Äôt that frightful for me.",t3_r9tife
hnezzlj,t1_hnexvqf,Thank you so much saying this! I would definitely like to work on a longer story about sinister messages in the stars as I definitely feel there is more to the idea.,t3_r9tife
hnei2oe,t1_hneha5d,"Thanks so much for saying this, I‚Äôm just coming out of a month long writers block and I really appreciate the motivation.",t3_r9tife
hnfwkoe,t1_hnfqxtg,"It really does have some Loki vibes, doesn‚Äôt it?",t3_r9tife
hnfwjb8,t1_hnfp5bp,Thanks so much!,t3_r9tife
hniywlm,t1_hnhoqp2,Thank you so much for the kind words.,t3_r9tife
hnee7aa,t1_hnedha8,"Guilt. He deciphered something he knew would bring sorrow and destruction into this world. 

Most major religions have a version of evil that exists to persuade the belief in their God or Gods.

Thanks for the constructive feedback. I guess I personally don‚Äôt think the end is cliche as this is one of my own biggest fears.",t3_r9tife
hnf51v2,t1_hnezzlj,"No thank you, it was really good!",t3_r9tife
hneerld,t1_hnee7aa,"Yeah, it's just clich√© to me personally but to each their own.

Nice idea for a story though, star systems as messages in the night sky, pretty cool.",t3_r9tife
hnef9qs,t1_hneerld,Thanks! I appreciate the feedback.,t3_r9tife
