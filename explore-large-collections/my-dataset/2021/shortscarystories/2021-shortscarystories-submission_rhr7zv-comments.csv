hos4pcs,t3_rhr7zv,This is very nice but not scary. I think we can all relate though!,t3_rhr7zv
hou25ef,t3_rhr7zv,"There’s no indication in the story that the windows are on opposite sides of the house. From the kitchen you mention only “the yard,” not specifically “the front yard.” It could be argued you could see both your back yard & the street from the same side of the house so it isn’t clear. 

I like what you were going for, I think it just needs a bit of tweaking in the words. Thanks for sharing! Cheers!",t3_rhr7zv
hos6y0a,t3_rhr7zv,Explain?,t3_rhr7zv
hou2bj3,t3_rhr7zv,"I don't know if I have missed something, but re reading it doesn't make me see anything out of place. And I think that's why this is actually creepy as fuck... It's what we've all done many times",t3_rhr7zv
hov0i9a,t3_rhr7zv,"I really like your writing style, you paint a good picture. Although, I definitely had to read the comments to catch what was out of place.",t3_rhr7zv
hos66bj,t1_hos4pcs,"Are you sure it's not scary at all? Did you catch ""it""? It's subtle (by design). ;)",t3_rhr7zv
houfawc,t1_hou25ef,"On my first pass, it did contain the added word ""front"" yard. Not sure why that didn't make it into the final draft. Thanks for catching it! I agree that that confused things.",t3_rhr7zv
hos9inu,t1_hos6y0a,"If you see the moon on the far horizon through your front window, you shouldn't be seeing it on the far horizon through your back window too.",t3_rhr7zv
hoyzmp1,t1_hov0i9a,"Aww, thank you! That means a lot to hear :)",t3_rhr7zv
hos6jhe,t1_hos66bj,Someone or something else pulled the covers down?,t3_rhr7zv
hosupln,t1_hos9inu,Took me several rereads to notice it! Just an additional 3 words changes the whole mood. Very subtle. I like it!,t3_rhr7zv
hos8ocm,t1_hos6jhe,"Maybe ""it"" is waiting for you to fell asleep again?",t3_rhr7zv
hos99e3,t1_hos6jhe,"If you look out your front window and see the moon on the far horizon ... and then look out your back window and see the moon on the far horizon, well ... one of them shouldn't be there, should it? :D",t3_rhr7zv
hosx9x6,t1_hosupln,Thank you! <3,t3_rhr7zv
hos9mu6,t1_hos8ocm,Fair enough!,t3_rhr7zv
