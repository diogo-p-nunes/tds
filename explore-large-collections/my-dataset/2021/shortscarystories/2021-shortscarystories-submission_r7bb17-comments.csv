hn153ld,t3_r7bb17,"Wow powerful. I, too, believe that trying to atone for your sins and thinking that all will be “forgiven” is an excuse people use to comfort themselves after behaving horribly. The best measure of a person is her actions, ethics and values during our earth lifetime. You don’t get a “do-over” in life.

Btw I am not a religious person but i believe there is a higher power at work in our universe.",t3_r7bb17
