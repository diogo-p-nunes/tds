hoowtmd,t3_rh8rqv,Inspired by and dedicated to our own local Three who wandered around our building. I haven’t seen him for a while and hope he’s ok 🐈 🐈🐈,t3_rh8rqv
hop4llv,t3_rh8rqv,I love this story! So unique and well written! Great job.,t3_rh8rqv
horhuog,t3_rh8rqv,"I thought the suitcase had a body in it, and the cat could sense it, which would've honestly been cliche. This is an excellent, fitting ending!

Edit: ""Three drew his lips drawn back and snarled."" ~ also believe there is a typo here.",t3_rh8rqv
hoptyez,t3_rh8rqv,Love that ending!,t3_rh8rqv
