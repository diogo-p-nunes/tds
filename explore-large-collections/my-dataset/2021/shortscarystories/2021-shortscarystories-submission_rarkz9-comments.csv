hnl8mpn,t3_rarkz9,"I was definitely expecting some vampires, or maybe the husband or the wife were the killer (I mean the official killers, not just in the generic sense) or killers (and the other didn't know, or that they would kill each other by mistaking the other for the killer.

What I did not expect is that the two of them would be targeted by the killers, and then kill them in self-defense.

As I often say, what makes a story like this great is that it could happen, and a scary story is way scarier the closer it gets to real life.",t3_rarkz9
hnl1xxu,t3_rarkz9,This was great. I loved the way you wrote it.,t3_rarkz9
hnl9lm7,t3_rarkz9,"Very unique! I don’t know if I’ve ever read what I would consider action/horror here. Well done, friend. Tense AF",t3_rarkz9
hnlccbe,t3_rarkz9,I'm don't get it. Is the fact that they fought back something they did wrong or what?,t3_rarkz9
hnl9dyn,t3_rarkz9,Love me some classic killer horror! Good job!,t3_rarkz9

hnli2i0,t3_rarkz9,"Wait what happened, did they kill each other?",t3_rarkz9
hnqac7j,t3_rarkz9,"I love how it has that 80s/90s feel to it.  Killer on the loose, she’s twirling the phone cord - definitely a classic slasher vibe to it.",t3_rarkz9
hnld4zx,t3_rarkz9,holy shit what an amazing story !,t3_rarkz9
hnlt3xg,t3_rarkz9,"I think Jamie and Leah might become the next Moonlight Killers. They both felt the taste of blood, and their mindset got changed. Clearly, Jaime was going to murder a person that was trying to escape.

Once you kill them, you become a killer too.

That's how I got the story.",t3_rarkz9
hnlhmo4,t3_rarkz9,"So, did attempting to fight back unleash another cascade of events- considering the advice off the telly.....

Good read btw-",t3_rarkz9
hnlnfrd,t1_hnlccbe,"No, the psychologist was warning them that it was dangerous to try to fight because there are so many. Leah and Jamie were fighting back amidst this warning playing on the TV.",t3_rarkz9
hnllbmf,t1_hnli2i0,"As the news was saying, there had to be more than one killer and you can imagine it like jumping scenes: from husband fighting for his life leaving work and the wife fighting for hers at home....they killed two of the Moonlight Killers!

Great read OP!! I loved the formatting, it was different than a lot of the things I've read and I really enjoyed it as a whole!",t3_rarkz9
