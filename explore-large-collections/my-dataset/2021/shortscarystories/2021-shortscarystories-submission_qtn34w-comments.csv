hkl9wxw,t3_qtn34w,He should've named his son Kenny instead of Bobby,t3_qtn34w
hkkppyy,t3_qtn34w,"Now, that was an unexpected ending.",t3_qtn34w
hknthyl,t3_qtn34w,"""I found out about his regenerative ability quite by accident. Bobby was a lively two-year old, in that manic stage of curiosity, sticking in his hands in everything, moving like lightening. I had made myself a smoothie and he had been watching me shove frozen bananas into the blender. I turned around for a minute, when I suddenly heard the blender whizz and a split second later, his screams. Blood and flesh spattering everywhere. I grabbed him from the counter where he had climbed, switched off the blender, and reached my phone to dial 911. And then- I paused. His hand- his arm which had been jammed in the blender a second ago- it was perfect. Every finger, nail, intact. Not even a scar. He was still sobbing from pain. I picked up my sharpest kitchen knife- to test my theory...""

Sorry, you messed with my brain goddammit.",t3_qtn34w

hko2i9t,t3_qtn34w,Wondering if the t-shirt and underwear also regenerate?,t3_qtn34w
hkoxysd,t3_qtn34w,I don‚Äôt think the title of this thread is worthy of the stories found here.  These should be called short twisted stories.  I absolutely love this! What a bunch of sickos coming up with stuff like this! It‚Äôs so bizarre and   I never know what to expect. These stories are not written by just ‚Äúwanna be writers‚Äù. There is some serious talent bringing forth some really excellent horrific tales.  Too bad you all didn‚Äôt know each other - you could publish a book of short stories by a multitude of authors. Everything I‚Äôve read so far has been magnificently twisted and bizarre. I can‚Äôt wait to see what shows up next!,t3_qtn34w
