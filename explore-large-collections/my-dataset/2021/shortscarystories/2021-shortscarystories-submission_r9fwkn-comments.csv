hnenebu,t1_hnedo1e,"Yeah i could see how it was a joke and seamed hevly inspired by Kitsune folk lore.  
The fact it ends with her still being horny and the fact she never just shaved or had 6 nipples kinda threw it off sideways.",t3_r9fwkn

hnf4st0,t1_hnf42re,"Yeah, i always worry that i'll tell a story one way and then people will come out of the wood work to tell me how my thing is insulting to there people cus its to much like x and x would never do that.",t3_r9fwkn
