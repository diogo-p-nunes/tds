hnp5x7m,t1_hnov3a0,"I *always* wake up, even after I warn them. The fucking worst.",t3_rbi6v6
hnp14o3,t1_hnov3a0,was your experience horrible also?,t3_rbi6v6
hnq4m5z,t1_hnp5x7m,"Oooo...so sorry to hear that. I always warn them too now, and so far they keep a close eye on things so no repeats.",t3_rbi6v6
hnq4doh,t1_hnp14o3,"No not really. I wasn't having ""surgery"" per se. I was having an upper endoscopy to check for ulcers, where the doctor puts a tube with a camera attached down the esophagus into the stomach to search for any abnormalities. In my case, I was under anesthetic for the test. Anyway, I remember waking up (at least partially) and realizing that the doctor is still in the middle of the procedure, the tube is down my throat yet. No pain, everything is just kind of blurry. I kinda remember thinking, ""oh hey, he's not done yet. Hmmmm...."" And then I hear him say, ""uh-oh, she's awake, give her some more..."" whatever lovely drug they were using to keep me knocked out was. Then I just sort of drifted back off. 

So that was how I spent Christmas Eve when I was 18 years old. Oh and they did find two bleeding ulcers, which they were able to treat and relieved all the tremendous pain I had been having. So no, not a horrendous experience. But definitely a memorable one.",t3_rbi6v6
