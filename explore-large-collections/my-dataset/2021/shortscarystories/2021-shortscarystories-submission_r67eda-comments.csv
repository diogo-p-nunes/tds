hms570s,t3_r67eda,"Love how you fleshed this out! Lots of stories on here are like, ""oh, the submissive character surprises us by doing something horrible, how scary."" But this one feels so different. You characterized everyone strongly and paced it well, so when it happened, the twist actually surprised me! Best example of that story type that I've seen on here. Thank you for sharing!",t3_r67eda
hmsu3uc,t3_r67eda,"You got this down perfectly, it hit really close to home as someone with anxiety, trauma and alot of trust issues. I mimic people's emotions often, sometimes to the point when I'm around a group of people i don't know how to act because i have ranging personalities for each different person.",t3_r67eda
