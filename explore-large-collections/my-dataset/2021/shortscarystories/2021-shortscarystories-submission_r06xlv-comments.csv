hlqvt47,t3_r06xlv,Good story,t3_r06xlv
hlrqd26,t3_r06xlv,"To be honest, I'm getting tired of the exploitation of mentally ill people in short horror pieces. Not only is it an overdone and boring trope, ""he was schizophrenic!!!!!"", but it also propagates harmful and unrealistic stigmas centered around these people who are more often than not just unfortunate victims of congenital deficiencies.",t3_r06xlv
hmyr868,t3_r06xlv," I am a voice actor that has recently joined a voice acting Youtube channel, I very much enjoyed reading so much so that I read it to my editors and the found it amazing.  
and so i have come to you to ask if you would give me permission to feature your work on my channel. thank you in advance. you reddit acount and others will be linked in the discription",t3_r06xlv
hlrsh36,t1_hlrqd26,"I think its more ""he's being haunted by the ghost of someone he killed"", nothing to do with someone being schizophrenic. He has the trauma of killing his mother which comes back to haunt him every thanksgiving.",t3_r06xlv
hlrw4nh,t1_hlrqd26,"""Explotation of mentally ill people in short horror pieces"" you mean.. stories? 

Every story has reality in it whether it was classism, racism, xenophobia whatever the story is about it has some problems we have in our reality",t3_r06xlv
hlrs3c8,t1_hlrqd26,It’s a story…. Stop making it out to be something it’s not,t3_r06xlv
hluu6vs,t1_hlrqd26,"As someone who litterly experiences hallucinations, I could not care less  about certain stigma, it's not like I meet someone and immediately go ""I see shit shit that's not there""",t3_r06xlv
hn0wt5a,t1_hmyr868,yes! Please feel free! Can I have a link or name to your channel?,t3_r06xlv
hlsoa8b,t1_hlrsh36,"If her ghost goes away when he takes meds, is it a ghost or a hallucination?",t3_r06xlv
hlsyaiu,t1_hlrw4nh,"Except if it was portrayed as such. Like, if there was a story that used classism in a way that always portrayed poor people to be thieves who don’t work for what they have, then that would be a problem. 

I get what this person is saying. The, “Surprise, they’re a killer cause they’re mentally ill!” thing can propagate stereotypes about mentally ill people. Not every killer is mentally ill. The majority of mentally ill people don’t kill anyone. 

And I’m not entirely agreeing with this person’s point. But that *was* their point. I’m just explaining it.",t3_r06xlv
hlvu56h,t1_hluu6vs,"You're lucky then that your psychosis is manageable and not obvious to others. Perhaps this stigmatization doesn't bother you. 

Many others are not so lucky and because of stigma like this, they don't get jobs, they get disowned and ostracized. 

As a psychiatry registrar, I see hundreds of patients every year who go through that. It's heartbreaking.",t3_r06xlv
hlsofd8,t1_hlsoa8b,"Honestly, I don't know. There's a chance it's a ghost that'll only appear around that time to haunt him, and a chance it's a hallucination triggered by the hidden trauma of doing so.",t3_r06xlv
hlt7qcx,t1_hlsyaiu,"Who says that mentally ill people kill people? Maybe they were in shock after they killed them and this is their way of coping or maybe they are stuck in a loop

The ""mentally ill people are bad"" is your own interpretation and nowhere in the story does it say that",t3_r06xlv
hm6azef,t1_hlvu56h,I'm...one of those people.,t3_r06xlv
hltgv53,t1_hlt7qcx,Speaker lives in a facility with an all-white padded room where they regularly get medicated and side effects cause hallucinations. Speaker is then given more medicine to make the hallucinations go away. That alludes to mental illness.,t3_r06xlv
hlu2p6v,t1_hltgv53,No it doesn't. :),t3_r06xlv
hluam7n,t1_hlu2p6v,"I would argue that that is an allusion to someone living in a mental health facility regardless is the person is mentally ill or not. An allusion. Even if it’s not confirmed. But what did you mean then, if they are not in a mental health facility?",t3_r06xlv
hluaxmt,t1_hluam7n,"they also have solitary confinement rooms in prisons and/or jails. i meant more towards that, than a mental health facility, but wanted to change the scenery instead of outright saying ""prison or jail"". saying the speaker killed their mother should have been the give away for prison and/or jail. medicine is only to make them realize what they did, rather than give into their illusion that they didn't do it or mother is really there.",t3_r06xlv
hlvg8zh,t1_hluaxmt,"There is no way to interpret this as anything other than a hospital type setting, especially if they are allowed out to spend time with their family. A person in solitary confinement in prison would almost certainly have their visitation privileges revoked. Also the solitary confinement cells aren't exactly padded white rooms. 

>saying the speaker killed their mother should have been the give away for prison and/or jail.

Except that it isn't--not when the scenery you described leans into the stereotype of mental health facility. It's like the saying ""when you hear hoofbeats, you think horses, not zebras."" Readers go with the most obvious choice unless given evidence otherwise. The fact that the narrator killed someone isn't enough. 

To be fair, my interpretation would be ""mental institution for criminals"" because when someone pleads insanity they aren't just in a normal facility. But if you were going for prison, it didn't work for me.",t3_r06xlv
hlug0rj,t1_hluaxmt,"Oh come on, guy. Own up to it. That's like portraying someone in a white lab coat with a chart in their hand in a hospital and saying that oh no, i actually meant to say that person is a pharmacist, not a doctor.",t3_r06xlv
hlugjq1,t1_hlug0rj,"bold of you to assume I'm a male. if you're the OP,  you can assume anything you want of the story. seeing as I'm the one who wrote it, I know what I meant. Have a nice day. :)",t3_r06xlv
