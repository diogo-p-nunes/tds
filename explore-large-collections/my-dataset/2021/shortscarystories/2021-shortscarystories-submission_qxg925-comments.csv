A post-apocalyptic Sci-fi ghost story for ya. Happy Friday!",t3_qxg925
hl9l3li,t3_qxg925,I really like this. Awesome imagery.,t3_qxg925
hldga9s,t3_qxg925,"Beautiful as always, Gent. While you’re excellent at bringing the scare factor, you’re most impressive at how. Let me count those ways. You’re talent for the intellectual scare is truly astonishing. You’re ability for that comedic horror is wonderfully wicked. You’re skill with the gore has always slaked my insatiable thirst.",t3_qxg925
hld7rmm,t3_qxg925,"Lamenting the land of the rising sun . . .

*Later…*

🪦 DG’s epitaph could have said “rest in peace” but instead, he had a rambling story chiseled into the surface of the stone. I read the crowded text, counted the words—491. But that made me wonder… 

I dug at the base of the headstone, my fingers growing numb in the cold soil. The stone kept going down, descending further and further into the earth. By dusk, I had dug down nearly six feet, searching for the final words—the words I knew would make an even 500. And then I found them by moonlight as night gathered overhead. 

*So good of you to join me. Thanks Darlin.*",t3_qxg925
hldyji7,t1_hld7rmm,This story came from our discussion about Steinbeck. The dust bowl. We stoke each other’s fires 😁,t3_qxg925

Thanks!",t3_qxg925
hl9mgj5,t1_hl9mdzz,Definitely felt that. Awesome work.,t3_qxg925
hlhg9z6,t1_hldyji7,Amen.  I once wrote a story in response to a comment you made on someone else's story.,t3_qxg925
hliueau,t1_hlhg9z6,"Oh? I’d say ‘do tell,’ but I forget most stories I write. That comment is probably buried in the mental murk",t3_qxg925
hlkaij5,t1_hliueau,"But I remember well enough to tell.  Someone had written a story about finding their wife's body in a tub (she'd committed suicide).  You'd commented something about a double suicide in a tub, so I wrote a story called ""A Double Suicide in a Tub (or something of the like),"" and sort of piggy-backed it off the original story.",t3_qxg925
