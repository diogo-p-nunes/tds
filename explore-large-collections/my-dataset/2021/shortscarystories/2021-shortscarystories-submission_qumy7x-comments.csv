hkszlgl,t3_qumy7x,"This is wonderfully written but I'm also loling because I started watching Dexter: New Blood, same vibe <3",t3_qumy7x
hkrffqk,t1_hkr48xo,I am also confused,t3_qumy7x
hkrb6k0,t1_hkr48xo,can u explain it to me,t3_qumy7x

hkrpduj,t1_hkrb6k0,"I like OP's writing because everyone is always so nonchalantly off-beat. There's no hidden thing to explain. It's about quitting murder told in the style of someone quitting alcohol or something. I think that's clever, funny, and pretty creepy.",t3_qumy7x

hksj0e6,t1_hkseu6k,"This is an awesome interpretation.  The more I think on it, the more it makes sense. Ty!",t3_qumy7x
hksy6zh,t1_hkseu6k,“Well done” (execution by electric chair) party aligns with this theory to me!,t3_qumy7x
hkssinv,t1_hksj0e6,Thank you! That makes me feel good.,t3_qumy7x
