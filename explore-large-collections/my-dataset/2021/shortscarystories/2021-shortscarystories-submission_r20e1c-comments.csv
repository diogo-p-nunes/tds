hm1vqse,t3_r20e1c,"Having recently dealt with some bad black mould in real life, I found this story slightly traumatic ðŸ˜„ The descriptions were incredibly vivid, and it was only too easy to imagine the sight, the feel, the smell... ðŸ¤¢

Really well written and suspenseful, despite the unpleasantness I couldn't stop reading ðŸ™‚ I was afraid of how far the mould would go, how destructive it would become. I'd suggest Cillit Bang Black Mould Spray, but I have the awful feeling that your particular mould is far beyond help â˜¹",t3_r20e1c
