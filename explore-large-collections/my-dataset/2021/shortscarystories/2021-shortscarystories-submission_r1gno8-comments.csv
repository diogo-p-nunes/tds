hlz3emn,t3_r1gno8,"I'm definitely using this recipe soon. But I'm wondering, can you substitute seventysomething year old man for 40 something year old man if you use the same age range for the other 2? Cause if I can substitute meats, there are so many ""family"" dishes I'll be able to make.",t3_r1gno8

hlzm0db,t3_r1gno8,"Love your name! Pratchett fan by any chance? 

Cool story. Loved the twist ending.",t3_r1gno8
hm0xomj,t3_r1gno8,Head off to the store to pick up some last-minute cranberry sauce for added plausible deniability.,t3_r1gno8
hm1v6if,t3_r1gno8,I read this whole thing without realizing what sub I was in. I thought it was r/food or something omg,t3_r1gno8
hlzpzjp,t3_r1gno8,"I loved the questionably realistic narration haha! I think the cannibalism 3-ingredient 3-people ending was predictable, but regardless the style the story was written in made it a fun read!",t3_r1gno8
hlyyzrt,t3_r1gno8,"The title sounds like something Jen Psaki or Biden would say. ""Deal with it, peasants""",t3_r1gno8
hlzmbc0,t1_hlz3emn,"I think if you substitute a 40 year old man for a 70 year old man, you need to add a 30 year old man to the mix as well. Bone apple tea!",t3_r1gno8
hlzsn9w,t1_hlz3emn,"Personal opinion:

As long as the age of all three ingredients falls between 170-200, I'd say you'd be fairly on track - then at least you've got a good range of ingredients to pick and choose from, and you can mix it up from one event to the next - after all, variety is the spice of life!",t3_r1gno8
hlz1duu,t1_hlyugvt,I was going to say the exact same thing lol,t3_r1gno8
hlzywmj,t1_hlzm0db,Yes! so cool that your recognized it.,t3_r1gno8
hm0brtp,t1_hlzpzjp,It wasn’t cannibalism.  She didn’t eat them.  That’s what makes it interesting.,t3_r1gno8
hlzz0t9,t1_hlzywmj,He's a brilliant character. But I love Rinsewind!,t3_r1gno8
hm3t4md,t1_hlzywmj,"Damn, you didn’t have to kill your husband :(",t3_r1gno8
hm0syam,t1_hlzz0t9,Discworld is great. Vimes is my favourite.,t3_r1gno8
