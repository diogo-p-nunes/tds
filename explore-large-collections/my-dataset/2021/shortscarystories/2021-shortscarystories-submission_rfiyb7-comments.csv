hoei0pk,t3_rfiyb7,This is excellent.,t3_rfiyb7
hoez4w6,t3_rfiyb7,"Awesome, very Lovecraft, and not just because of the Nyarlathotep reference.",t3_rfiyb7
hohd6pu,t3_rfiyb7,"Quick math:  The gravity on such a planet would be about 0.58 m/s^2.  Thatâ€™s only one-seventeeth that of earth, or one-third that of the moon!

hoeke6l,t1_hoei0pk,It was a real fight to get it under 500 let me tell you. I got it down to 495 because I wasnâ€™t sure if the title counted and I wanted it to be 499 all together just to make absolutely sure. This is my first attempt at SSS. 500 words is super short when you think about it.,t3_rfiyb7
hofhvwm,t1_hoeke6l,"You executed the concept brilliantly, even in such short format. Though I would absolutely not mind reading a longer work about planet 9. I love everything about this short story.",t3_rfiyb7
hoeso9n,t1_hoeke6l,Definitely but you did a lot with those 500 words.,t3_rfiyb7

hofp5lt,t1_hofhvwm,Thanks!,t3_rfiyb7
hohtiyt,t1_hofhvwm,"Ahh this short story was amazing! I want to read more about this ðŸ˜© maybe post a longer version in r/nosleep or something on your profile? Anyways, loved the tension and eerie feeling in the story!",t3_rfiyb7
hogpzsq,t1_hofp5lt,Please make a part 2.,t3_rfiyb7
hogw8hn,t1_hogpzsq,Is against rules :(,t3_rfiyb7
