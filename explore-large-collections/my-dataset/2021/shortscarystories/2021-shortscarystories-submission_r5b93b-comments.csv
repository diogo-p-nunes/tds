hmnd4pi,t3_r5b93b,"Sounds a bit illogical. If the directive is, *""No one with this variant is allowed to land""*, then that means it is a highly contagious disease.

So wouldn't the people in the plane be infected too? And therefore the whole plane will have to be either destroyed or quarantined with all the passengers inside?",t3_r5b93b
hmmpngg,t3_r5b93b,Great story the fact that the flight attendant and her sultry eyes for a description but no one else did. Wel I guess you did call the doctor a greying woman hahaha  but in a longer story where we get to know the character the description for the flight attendant is understandable but I feel like In this setting it seemed a little forced and out of place. Im sorry I just realized I’m not sure if you even wanted critiques lmao but I am only saying it because I really enjoyed the story and it made me think. That could totally happen to tbh we’d just never know because it’d get covered up to look like natural or accidental death,t3_r5b93b
hmm0u05,t3_r5b93b,"Way too much description about the flight attendants face compared to the descriptions of everyone else, but otherwise a great story!",t3_r5b93b

hmneot1,t1_hmnd4pi,Yes the whole plane will have to be quarantined upon landing. ✈️ thanks for commenting 🙏,t3_r5b93b
hmnjlon,t1_hmmpngg,I think you'd know if a casket landed on your head!lol.,t3_r5b93b
hmmzmdi,t1_hmmpngg,"Thanks for the comment and I think given how much the flight attendant’s sultry eyes caught attention, I think perhaps it wasn’t a misstep after all! I’m glad you enjoyed the story🌷",t3_r5b93b
hmn5y13,t1_hmm0u05,"Yeah, “One of the flight attendants beckoned…” would have been effective and not jarring.",t3_r5b93b
hmpfj58,t1_hmm0u05,"This. Felt like I was reading a steamy romance novel for a second, not a scary story. Her appearance wasn't relevant to the story, so it should have been omitted.",t3_r5b93b
hmm16wr,t1_hmm0u05,"Thank you and I know what you mean, I was pandering a bit there- is it a real story if it doesn't contain a description of a beautiful woman in it? Or is it just a manual lol?",t3_r5b93b

hmmc7v3,t1_hmm9k4b," Thank you for the comment, here have a cup of 🫖 🍵 😌",t3_r5b93b
hmot8tf,t1_hmneot1,Which is why they'd have been better throwing the air casket out of the plane.No more quarantine!!!!! Lol. Just kidding!,t3_r5b93b
hmomegk,t1_hmnjlon,"I don't think ""air casket"" referred to the casket being thrown out of the airplane, just casket that was used in the airplance. They would have returned the body appropriately, in due course, they weren't monsters! :D",t3_r5b93b
hmlzqgh,t1_hmlzl4v,"I understand that, and I genuinely enjoyed the story. But with the social climate, there is no telling who might show up.",t3_r5b93b
