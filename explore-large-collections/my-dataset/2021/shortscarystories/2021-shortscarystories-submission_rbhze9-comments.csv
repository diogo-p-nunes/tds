hnskh9c,t3_rbhze9,"For some reason instead of “pop out”, I read “I’ve got to poop, David” and I didn’t even question I might’ve read it wrong, I just spent way too long trying to figure out why on earth that was gonna take him a few hours",t3_rbhze9
hnpcxjl,t3_rbhze9,Great story.  I really liked the concept. The ending totally made me aawwe out loud.,t3_rbhze9
