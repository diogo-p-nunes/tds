hp9ji6i,t3_rkg3n3,"This was originally part of the NYCSecret 250 word challenge (Historical fiction, including action: walking under a ladder and word: melt). 

I ended up submitting another story instead, so I thought this sub might appreciate a 500 word version that felt much better.

The setting is the Paris catacombs in 1810, during the relocation of the bones from the city cemeteries (including Les Innocents).",t3_rkg3n3
