hlkzo5e,t3_qz3z2s,"Perfectly captures that feeling, of watching someone destroy everything you have and then have them look at you in the eye and blame you",t3_qz3z2s
hljz1d6,t3_qz3z2s,"Wrote this after a conversation with my buddy. His parents are giving him and his wife shit for not getting on the property ladder, despite the fact they can’t get approved for a mortgage. They’re also hardcore NIMBYS and don’t see the paradox there…

hlkfaxb,t3_qz3z2s,"Wow, that's a pretty horrifying scenario... Great story!",t3_qz3z2s
hlkqugn,t3_qz3z2s,"Goddamn, this reminds me a bit of The Purge and the baseline concept of The Thinning. Something that benefits one class (the rich or the intelligent) but fucks over everyone else because of the benefited class’s entitlement.",t3_qz3z2s
hlllnpo,t3_qz3z2s,"Well, we already are in a similar situation aren’t we? They destroyed the climate and now we have to pay the piper. I can’t stand boomers.",t3_qz3z2s
hlkx6i8,t3_qz3z2s,Makes me simmer with rage,t3_qz3z2s
hlkc34g,t3_qz3z2s,Wow. Incorporating all the usual excuses boomers say and using that for the ending.. Absolutely brilliant!,t3_qz3z2s
hlllahb,t3_qz3z2s,"Please don't give them any ideas!! 

But for real - awesome story.",t3_qz3z2s
hll7qos,t3_qz3z2s,"This is great! Social commentary, on multiple levels, and ends with a punch.",t3_qz3z2s
hllcazz,t3_qz3z2s,"Oh, dear! It reminds me of the movie *Get Out*. Either way, old people target the youth and harvest whatever they can from them.",t3_qz3z2s
hll13gx,t3_qz3z2s,I know this isn’t a real scenario but the fact that it seems so damn real and totally something boomers would do makes me so pissed bruhhh,t3_qz3z2s
hlkptlt,t3_qz3z2s,"Fantastic writing.
Too scary for me!",t3_qz3z2s
hlkrsje,t3_qz3z2s,Holy shit that sent chills down my spine. Really awesome story,t3_qz3z2s
hlld20r,t3_qz3z2s,"Wow, the way that this scenario is so true is shocking. As soon as it benefits them, they can change the entire narrative",t3_qz3z2s
hlll6wn,t3_qz3z2s,Ugh. Never had any visceral hatred towards any non-rapist bad guys in any of these before.,t3_qz3z2s
hll4f2l,t3_qz3z2s,"Jeez, that's horrifying AND dystopic.",t3_qz3z2s
hlmdims,t3_qz3z2s,This story made my lungs itch. Very good.,t3_qz3z2s
hlk7s2k,t3_qz3z2s,Fantastic story,t3_qz3z2s
hlm01bx,t3_qz3z2s,Amazing! What a conception. So fanatical yet so true.,t3_qz3z2s
hlmfubf,t3_qz3z2s,I had major reactions to this! You did an amazing job yet I feel serious anger because I know that if this was a possibility it would happen! Great and horrible story haha good job!,t3_qz3z2s
hlnd94r,t3_qz3z2s,"We keep getting horror stories closer and closer to the truth but people just think it’s fiction. Movies, TV, and these short stories should not be taken with a grain of salt.",t3_qz3z2s
hlkwo5i,t3_qz3z2s,Fuck. Too real.,t3_qz3z2s
hll1opu,t3_qz3z2s,Love it,t3_qz3z2s
hllf9z8,t3_qz3z2s,"Great job! 

Kept me hooked til the very end!",t3_qz3z2s
hlmgb45,t3_qz3z2s,I fucking hate boomers with a burning passion. I cannot wait for those bastards to die off.,t3_qz3z2s
hln5474,t3_qz3z2s,"This is a great story! I gotta be honest though, the last part was pretty funny.",t3_qz3z2s
hln6hav,t3_qz3z2s,"Oh shit, well done!",t3_qz3z2s
hln71df,t3_qz3z2s,"The subtle touch - who was actually doing the hard labor of rounding up all the young folks? Oddly enough, it makes sense.

We know plenty of inter-generationals who would gladly sell their future (and that of the youngest) down a river for a taste of the power that the oldest in our society have. Looks like they were promised a place in line.",t3_qz3z2s
hlnwf2f,t3_qz3z2s,"I wonder if the procedures can be reversed, given that the perpetrators are suddenly healthy. They might look very appealing to young, unhealthy victims seeking justice.",t3_qz3z2s
hlnf2a2,t3_qz3z2s,What if this was actually real?,t3_qz3z2s
hlnk8ug,t3_qz3z2s,Jesus. This is WAY too fuckin real. Let’s pray that procedure never becomes reality.,t3_qz3z2s
hlnky4x,t3_qz3z2s,Really great story.,t3_qz3z2s
hlo17ss,t3_qz3z2s,Those vultures!,t3_qz3z2s
hlp08u9,t3_qz3z2s,Hits home. Well done,t3_qz3z2s
hlztgw2,t3_qz3z2s,This is the wrong horror story to read while high and listening to Eleanor Rigby.,t3_qz3z2s
hm3vi36,t3_qz3z2s,"If they find a way to make this real, they'd definitely do it. I feel sick...",t3_qz3z2s
hp7ybxv,t3_qz3z2s,i already hated boomers,t3_qz3z2s
hp9tro1,t3_qz3z2s,So scary because of how real it feels.,t3_qz3z2s
hll6c3t,t3_qz3z2s,I don’t get it.,t3_qz3z2s
hlmm9tm,t3_qz3z2s,You'll get old too. Don't act like this is just a boomer thing.,t3_qz3z2s
hlnwkxh,t3_qz3z2s,"O M G ,it's just soooooo real on so many levels.",t3_qz3z2s
hlpqrno,t3_qz3z2s,"Oh, I could see this continuing onto another political subject once they wipe out the current younger generations. Most (if not all) of them would be pro-life, but in this case it's so they'll have a continuous supply of youth to harvest.",t3_qz3z2s
hlraatc,t3_qz3z2s,Gave me strong Ted Chiang vibes! Excellent read,t3_qz3z2s
hluyd7r,t3_qz3z2s,Tell me why this shouldn't be made into a movie.,t3_qz3z2s
hlw5rrz,t3_qz3z2s,Absolute genius.,t3_qz3z2s
ho7zbs9,t3_qz3z2s,"Lord, thats some real horror",t3_qz3z2s
hpb0s5z,t3_qz3z2s,I read this story over a week ago and I can’t stop thinking about it. Boomers are the worst.,t3_qz3z2s
hlk4gx3,t1_hljz1d6,"Had a lovely conversation with and older couple at my bar about this last week... They insisted we ""just need to start small"" and go from there. Well small in my area (and 950 sq foot house is going for around 300k) and everything is selling above asking price. They also pushed getting a degree on me when i explained to them i wouldnt be making any more in the industry with a degree, per 2 separate conversations i had with two different owners of different farms. If anything i would be making less. I make 3 to 4 times that income bartending. My wars started to shut off when they proceeded to complain about their bartender from a previous night who was going to school to become a social worker to help out the police and how ""criminals will always be criminals"" regardless of how their situations are approached.


Also FANTASTIC story by the way! One of those few on this subreddit that has stood out to me. Well done!",t3_qz3z2s
hllldk8,t1_hlkqugn,Isn’t The Purge gradually revealing an underlying plot that people aren’t inherently evil and almost nobody in the lower classes is actually going out and killing people on Purge night which was the unexpected consequence of creating it.,t3_qz3z2s
hllxw9q,t1_hlllnpo,"I'm Gen X. I have seen what boomers have done to this country. I'm older than most on this thread but I have millennials and I cannot stand the debt they will end up paying as well as the fact that ""boomers"" are sitting on piles of money while so many younger people are in debt $100K or more from college that they attended at a much lower cost. This story reminded me of what the boomer generation has taken from our children. Everything.",t3_qz3z2s
hlllqdv,t1_hlllnpo,[deleted],t3_qz3z2s
hlllkv0,t1_hll6c3t,"If today’s older people could renew their youth by draining it from the young, do you think they would? Maybe not your family because they’re genuinely upstanding people who understand the natural course of life, but most of the older people (60s-70s currently but not really the 80+ crowd) in the US would totally do it.",t3_qz3z2s
hlnlah2,t1_hlmm9tm,"Will I get old? Yes.

Will I expect the younger generations to pay for my every action and mistake? No.",t3_qz3z2s
hlny4mo,t1_hlk4gx3,"Oof. Service industry here too, and in the most expensive city in the US. I feel like I’ve had that conversation with many older couples at work.",t3_qz3z2s
hllqc1z,t1_hllldk8,"The idea is that the poor are generally the largest demographic of criminal offenders because they often have to steal to survive, so by creating The Purge, it’s ironically a way for the more wealthy and privileged to cleanse the land of the great unwashed, so to speak. The protagonists in the first are pretty rich and live in a gated community and have a panic room, in-depth security system and armoury, which the poor wouldn’t have the luxury of. Therefore, the poor aren’t gonna go out and purge, they’re gonna lock themselves somewhere to try and stay safe.",t3_qz3z2s
hllqcxz,t1_hlllqdv,No.(Born in 1953).,t3_qz3z2s
hlls89w,t1_hlllkv0,"50 year olds aren’t boomers. They are Gen X. I know. I am one. Born 1969. I believe the cut off age for Boomers…named for the huge amount of baby births post WWII…is 1959 or 1960. Lot of Karens are gen X, unfortunately.  Bitches making me look bad.. can’t even get a nice bob cut without people assuming you’re a self-centered  meanie. ;) Jamie Lee Curtis pixie cut FTW!

Plus, how dare that Boomer who stole OPs vitality calling themselves “The Greatest Generation”. That title is reserved for their parents!

Edit: I’d say the Boomers are from the age of selfishness. They lived in an era of great prosperity, and threw it away by denying anyone in the next generations a means to gain opportunity, advancement, or sustainability.  There’s a reason Gen X is kinda jaded and act like they don’t give a fuck.",t3_qz3z2s
hls73gq,t1_hlllkv0,"Oh, I meant I wasn’t sure what the reboot procedure that the author was referring to actually was, like, what does the procedure actually do?",t3_qz3z2s
hlnlig3,t1_hlnlah2,"Maybe you won't, but others will.",t3_qz3z2s
hllqhqc,t1_hllqc1z,"yup, it’s a flawed concept that didn’t ultimately remove the “unwashed masses” at the desired rate. As far as I can tell of the overarching plot from years on end of previews for the Purge movies.",t3_qz3z2s
hllsmzi,t1_hlls89w,"Oh! Sorry about that, I forgot the cutoff for Boomers!",t3_qz3z2s
hltovts,t1_hls73gq,Read the third and fourth paragraphs carefully. That is what the reboot is.,t3_qz3z2s
hlnlptl,t1_hlnlig3,"No, I fully believe my generation has taken enough shit from past generations to not take the same path.",t3_qz3z2s
hlm56kp,t1_hllqhqc,"Yeah, from what I can tell, it's kind of the running theme for the Purge movies, and honestly I think it's interesting, and a pretty ironic social satire as well. The rich and wealthy elite think crime is dropping because of the Purge, but really it's just because there's one night a year where all the crime is committed and then the criminals are good Samaritans for the rest of the year. 

And it doesn't really take into account white-collar crime that rarely gets prosecuted, because nobody cares about Wall Street fat cats or hedge fund managers playing hocus-pocus with people's money or wages, so they could just continue their criminal activities even when the Purge wasn't on. 

Whereas stuff like murder, petty theft and blue-collar types of crime would be more heavily policed and punished. It's a self-defeating system but because it benefits the elite again, you can expect them to say it's working, just like in OP's story here. When the president is caught doing the procedure, they suddenly make it out to be completely harmless and a good thing, and then they turn the tables by making it about the working class (predominantly younger folk because they're what makes up today's workforce) and how they should do their bit for these elderly people. It's a self-fulfilling cycle because the elderly will sap the youth of today's lifespan, have children, only for them to probably use their own kids to sustain themselves. Therefore, you have a planet made up entirely of entitled people older than sin.",t3_qz3z2s
hlluebl,t1_hllsmzi,Lol! No problem. Not even mad.,t3_qz3z2s
hlnlu5r,t1_hlnlptl,Then you don't know your own species very well.,t3_qz3z2s
hm4bbuz,t1_hlnlptl,"Yeah, got to agree with the guy below: you don't know much about humanity, then. I'm glad you still have hope, though. That's admirable.",t3_qz3z2s
