hm47wfb,t3_r2eev7,"my first submission! I haven't written anything ""complete"" in a really long while. hope it's a fun one for you. Wanted to capture what an incel genius would be capable of from a narrative voice totally opposite of my own",t3_r2eev7
hm8f4g4,t3_r2eev7,"50 Times... Maybe the problem is you mate, not the ladies?
I think treating human beings like objects is evil enough to consider your story horror. A very good fictional approach to something that unfortunately is too real. Made me feel very uneasy. Well done 👏",t3_r2eev7
hme52v5,t3_r2eev7,"Ten thousand years, and narrator is such a prick in the neck! (/S)

Also, against women over a span of ten thousand years, narrator was not clever enough to find the common denominator.",t3_r2eev7
hm8x9rw,t3_r2eev7,Damn. Just damn.,t3_r2eev7
hm5n3p3,t1_hm47wfb,"Came out nicely although, at least for me, not really containing scary story vibes.",t3_r2eev7
hm5sckb,t1_hm5n3p3,"Thanks! I did a subtle edit or two to the way I worded things to reveal a little more of the reality from our unreliable narrator.

Those who don't live in our time are a lot easier to hide and get rid of when they try to ~~escape~~ cheat. And you can just put them back anywhere, it doesn't really matter 🤷🏻‍♀️",t3_r2eev7
