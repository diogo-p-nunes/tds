hon84n1,t3_rgzrfw,"This story is about [Sundown Towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_town), one of the many disgusting and enduring features of the Jim Crow American South. And North. And West, Center and East. 

A Wednesday thought thing: 

**‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt go there after dark; It‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù**  

For you, who‚Äôs being warned here? What‚Äôs the danger? Is that danger real or just the product of a fear? If that danger were codified into law, and bolstered by signs put up by the local government; if the danger *was* the local government, would it feel more real? A darkened alley and a flashing blue light‚Äîa threat, a hiding place and vice versa.",t3_rgzrfw
honaas4,t3_rgzrfw,"Very well done. I applaud you for doing a story on this subject. And the writing is very well done. The tension built up perfectly. I could sense the danger coming but I had no idea what was going to happen.

This danger is real. I loved the story. I like how it played out. The dialog was smooth. You have written a piece that hopefully will help some people understand some of the difficulties other people have to go through. For absolutely nothing. Great job.ü§ô",t3_rgzrfw

hoq6n8e,t3_rgzrfw,What a classic!,t3_rgzrfw
hoqyv5i,t3_rgzrfw,"My son-in-law is African-American. I live in the worst of the crummy southern states - think 6-week ban  (not by choice, job related.) Thank you for putting into words the fear I have for him and my expected grandchild. I appreciate the link attached; I am going to read it now.",t3_rgzrfw
hooniyu,t3_rgzrfw,Reflection of who we were. Our task is to make sure it does not remain who we are.,t3_rgzrfw
hoqqxiz,t3_rgzrfw,Thanks for that. I never realized how much the concept spooked me.,t3_rgzrfw
hotgomk,t3_rgzrfw,This is legitimately terrifying.,t3_rgzrfw
honbt4b,t1_honaas4,"Thank you. It‚Äôs one of my more soapbox-y horror stories, but the genre is about fear and disgust. There‚Äôs a tool there.",t3_rgzrfw
hooowlr,t1_hooo1fl,There isn‚Äôt always an answer. Sometimes there‚Äôs just loss.,t3_rgzrfw
hooqgof,t1_hooniyu,"We can try. It takes energy to hate and energy to love. Significantly less to ignore. A seed of understanding rarely grows hate, but curiosity, empathy and compassion are the soil needed for love to thrive. We can try.",t3_rgzrfw
