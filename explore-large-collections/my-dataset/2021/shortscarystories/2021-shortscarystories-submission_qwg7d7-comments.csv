hl2pxsl,t3_qwg7d7,Brilliant. Honestly the beginning left me a little u sure of whether I'd enjoy it but the tone was spot on and the ending was great.,t3_qwg7d7
hl3yw5q,t3_qwg7d7,"Wow! My theory: The staircase represents what is essentially an eternal quest for knowledge, and the scientists who have died on the way are those whose curiosity have been sated, so they could no longer stay alive on the staircase. As long as questions still burn in the MC’s head, her heart will still beat with every step.",t3_qwg7d7

If you too enjoy soggy staircases that enhance your mind at the cost of your soul then come join me at r/leavesandink",t3_qwg7d7
hl3n29w,t3_qwg7d7,"This was great, incredibly unique. Well-written.",t3_qwg7d7
hl3oj4q,t3_qwg7d7,I loved the ending too!,t3_qwg7d7
hl4wg1o,t3_qwg7d7,Great story!  It vaguely reminds me of the beginning of Full Metal Alchemist.  One of the side effects of attempting human transmutation is having your brain assaulted by vast amounts of secret knowledge.,t3_qwg7d7
hl2sdwp,t1_hl2pxsl,Thank you! I'm aware the beginning bordered on cheesy but I'm very glad that this story was a pleasant surprise for you rather than a disappointment.,t3_qwg7d7
hl4hil3,t1_hl3yw5q,"That is a nice theory! The idea that MC is simply more curious than her predecessors is an interesting one, and the way you describe it makes it sound almost poetic instead of menacing.",t3_qwg7d7
hl4hjpc,t1_hl3n29w,"Thank you, I'm glad you like it.",t3_qwg7d7
hl4hls2,t1_hl3oj4q,Thank you very much.,t3_qwg7d7
hl519dz,t1_hl4wg1o,"I haven't seen Full Metal Alchemist in forever but I remember really loving it, what a lovely compliment!",t3_qwg7d7
hl3ohkp,t1_hl2sdwp,I loved the beginning.,t3_qwg7d7
hl5gmmk,t1_hl4hil3,"Haha, thank you! I really love themes of this kind because I personally have (or almost have) put myself in harm’s way just to learn more about the world. One time when I was five, I almost cut my thigh open with a rusty little saw I found outside our house to see if blood flowed freely in our body or in “pipes.” That feeling of unquenchable curiosity is difficult to resist sometimes.",t3_qwg7d7
hl4gw3h,t1_hl3ohkp,Thanks!,t3_qwg7d7
hld28n8,t1_hl5gmmk,Almost cutting your thigh open?! Please don't continue easing your curiosity this way.,t3_qwg7d7
hld89q4,t1_hld28n8,"Haha, don’t worry, I learned not to do that since XD!",t3_qwg7d7
