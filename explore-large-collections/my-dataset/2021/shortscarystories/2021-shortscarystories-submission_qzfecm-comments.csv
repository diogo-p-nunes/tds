hludu5p,t1_hlt7ilb,"I believe that ""she"" in the story is either his wife or lover who is trying to hide from the narrator to ""I' who could be anything from his wife to his friend or just a killer. In the story, she is hiding from the killer, who may have caught them in the act. The killer knows that they are sleeping in their bed. The killer knows the types of bedsheets, the smell of wine and paprika, shows that the killer knows the layout of the house and the relationship of the two. She (I assuming ""i"" is a she)knows that her husband is a heavy sleeper and won't wake up. And that the lover will start to caress him. The killer picks up on these little things and murders them after waiting overnight to do the deed. ""I"" knows what she is doing because I is watching she, but she doesn't know I was there  . That's why the narrative changes because we no longer follow she anymore, because I is there. I kills her with a gun, just like she did with him",t3_qzfecm
