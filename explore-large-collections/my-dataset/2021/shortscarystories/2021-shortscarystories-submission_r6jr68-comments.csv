hmtusdc,t3_r6jr68,I’ve read a LOT of stories here. I’ve seen some really great work. But this…. short. simple. terrifying…. take my upvote. Well done.,t3_r6jr68

hmucn6a,t3_r6jr68,10/10,t3_r6jr68
hmvjktd,t3_r6jr68,The idea for this is fucking BRILLIANT!!! The writing is on point. There is an eerie vibe to it that not very many short stories can bring out. My jaw is on the floor after reading this. Genius. I do not have high enough praise for you.,t3_r6jr68
hmvd2xd,t3_r6jr68,"So well done

BRAVO!",t3_r6jr68
hmwkcuu,t3_r6jr68,"Ooff!  Short and ~~Sweet~~ Scary! Excellent story!  Makes you think about how blind faith controls people, which is a horror story unto itself.",t3_r6jr68
hmwdl7p,t3_r6jr68,Well done!,t3_r6jr68
hmxcsxd,t3_r6jr68,If I heard voices telling me to kill my son I'd be straight to my gp.I don't know how anyone can read a holy book and believe every word they read. So much of them are contradictory and most have been changed over the years to make it look like God was perfect. We also know very little about the life of Jesus.,t3_r6jr68
hmwqj52,t3_r6jr68,LMAO,t3_r6jr68
hn1cla6,t3_r6jr68,"As a seminary student, absolutely loved this. The sacrifice of Isaac is truly one of the most disturbing Bible stories, especially when you pair it with the rest of their relationship. 

One critique would be to capitalize God and Lord since both are names from Abraham’s standpoint, not plain nouns.",t3_r6jr68
hmukwuk,t3_r6jr68,Dude. Don't trust the God of Abraham!,t3_r6jr68

hmvm459,t1_hmvltu3,And I'm a Christian,t3_r6jr68
hmvpbk6,t1_hmvn1b4,"I've always been fascinated by the story of Abraham's sacrifice. I wondered, ""How did he know it was God speaking to him? What if it wasn't?""

My interpretation is that the man in the story heard a voice telling him to kill his son. He assumed it was God telling him to do so. Maybe it wasn't.",t3_r6jr68
hmwfho5,t1_hmvpbk6,That's what faith is.,t3_r6jr68
