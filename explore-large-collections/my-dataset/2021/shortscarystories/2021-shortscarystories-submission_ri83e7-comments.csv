howajl0,t3_ri83e7,"So... The dream jar brought on a bad dream, so you breathed the rest of the bad dream into it? And buried it?

Then you had... Nine other bad dreams to fill the jars you didn't buy? 

I'm sorry I'm so confused. I feel like it's a good story but the concept is too deep for me maybe? I'm interested though.",t3_ri83e7
hovui7u,t3_ri83e7,This is actually really well done! Good job!,t3_ri83e7
hox2qy4,t1_howajl0,"No
The jars the girl were selling were used, they already had nightmares used it (if its from other ppl or herself its open to interpretation)
She sells that jars to ppl, they get disturbing dangerous nightmare from the previous owner and the only way to get rid of it is to blow it back
Then ahe geta it again and re-sells

In other words, she is a supernatural scammer",t3_ri83e7
hoyg2q8,t1_hox2qy4,"I don’t feel like this is quite it. If that was the case, why would they be all clean while being sold? What does she gain from this? Has he been having the other nine nightmares? Did other people not follow instructions so now the main character is cursed? Loved this story but still confused",t3_ri83e7
hozhfnp,t1_hox2qy4,The last line confuses me though. Why would he get nine more vile nightmares?,t3_ri83e7
hoymogi,t1_hoyg2q8,They only looked clean.  Once he got it home it was very dirty and scuffed.  So more magic? Good story,t3_ri83e7
hoys5ik,t1_hoyg2q8,"The OP wanted us to think she did that on purpose tho, since what he wrotte in the lasts lines, so is prob somerhing intentional, even if it isnt for the money",t3_ri83e7
hp5bnv8,t1_hozhfnp,"I believe because she was selling 10 jars for 10 cents apiece, then he gave her a dollar and only took one. So he’s still “owed” nine other nightmares but he doesn’t have the jars to put them in. Took me a minute but I think that’s it",t3_ri83e7
hp8dmhw,t1_hp5bnv8,"yep, sounds about right",t3_ri83e7
