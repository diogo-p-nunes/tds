hntijg9,t1_hntavgy,"Had a real life scenario similar to this. No rifles though. 

My question is, how do you fit an ar15 in a backpack? A collapsable stock would still be too long, maybe folding? 

Before someone else calls the reddit bot on me again, im fine",t3_rc7yu6
hnukyr0,t1_hntyyxh,This is something I had not considered. For that reason I will be deleting this story. Thank you,t3_rc7yu6
hntrd9p,t1_hntijg9,maybe if you have a really large backpack,t3_rc7yu6
