hoo515y,t3_rgbj7l,I do not understand,t3_rgbj7l
hom5l48,t1_holzyy1,Death by snu snu?,t3_rgbj7l
hone2sf,t1_holzyy1,"I""m not OP, but I'd bet god's of love die from murder a LOT. From jealous ex-lovers, jealous current lovers, jealous lovers-of-lovers, those they've rejected, those that see them as ""competition.""

And that's not even getting into the dark area of being executed brutally for loving ""wrong.""

Plus being the scapegoat anytime a village or a town or a nation faces any kind of disaster- people loooove to blame problems on those they deem morally inferior, and god's of love are probably on the outskirts of moral acceptability in a lot of straightlaced cultures

Edit: typo",t3_rgbj7l
homqpce,t1_homqdlq,Gave me shivers,t3_rgbj7l
homcgm6,t1_hom5l48,Only correct answer,t3_rgbj7l
hood089,t1_hone2sf,"My original comment was mostly a joke, but this an amazing answer! Gods of love would probably had a very hard time during the Spanish Inquisition and similar events.",t3_rgbj7l
hookp85,t1_hood089,"I thought it was a funny question, but also an interesting head scratcher. 

Have you seen ""Dangerous Beauty?"" This kinda reminds me of that.",t3_rgbj7l
hoolnuz,t1_hookp85,"I have not heard of that before. Looks interesting, though.

Here's another head scratcher for you: how would a god of laughter die?",t3_rgbj7l
hoopcm4,t1_hoolnuz,"Hmm...Accidents is my top pick. Being distracted by clowning around/showing off/joking and not being situationally aware, so they ends up being \*that guy\* who walks right in front of a moving car or straight into an airplane propeller. 

Not being situationally aware could also lead to pissing off the wrong person, or pushing someone too much.

Also not hearing/taking seriously warnings, like ""hey bro, you dont' want to go over there!""

And of course, at least once someone yells ""DUCK!"" and instead of squatting down, they yell back ""QUACK!"" and get their head torn off by something.

Also, slapstick can be brutally dangerous

Maybe occasionally a problem with rupturing stitches or something, just for variety. 

Ooooh and let's not forget dark/ironic comedy. Riding the bomb to earth Slim Pickens style, etc.",t3_rgbj7l
hoopq0p,t1_hoopcm4,You've hit the nail on the head again!,t3_rgbj7l
