hmwbu18,t3_r6xtlk,"I need to look at what sub I'm in, fucking hell",t3_r6xtlk
hmwcj53,t3_r6xtlk,YOU GOT ME! I truly had to check what sub i was in at the end because I couldn’t believe that ending.   I was shocked for you and also feeling bad too.  Great writing!,t3_r6xtlk
hmwhgd0,t3_r6xtlk,"I dont get it, can someone explain?",t3_r6xtlk
hmwfqjo,t3_r6xtlk,"ESH. Look, you took a DNA test without his permission, that's crossing major boundaries. But he didn't need to react like you just outed him as a serial killer or something.",t3_r6xtlk
hmwvrp6,t3_r6xtlk,"YTA. What he does with his free time is his choice & if he likes killing little old ladies then you should be happy he found a hobby and isn’t out cheating. Now he’s going to be locked in jail, all because you were ‘curious’.",t3_r6xtlk
hmwez0r,t3_r6xtlk,This style doesn't usually catch me out but - bravo. Nicely done.,t3_r6xtlk
hmwju4h,t3_r6xtlk,Omg I didn't check what sub I was in. Was really concerned lol. Good one,t3_r6xtlk
hmxrxgu,t3_r6xtlk,"NTA

While i agree taking a DNA est without him knowing what kind of assholish, he should have slept with his mouth closed",t3_r6xtlk
hmwcz1p,t3_r6xtlk,Bravo!! Great story. Good twist.,t3_r6xtlk
hmwczjy,t3_r6xtlk,Great work!,t3_r6xtlk
hmwfatm,t3_r6xtlk,"Damn it you got me!!

-slow clap-",t3_r6xtlk
hmy062t,t3_r6xtlk,"NTA, he’s a serial killer so you can do whatever you please",t3_r6xtlk
hmwi1jl,t3_r6xtlk,"Amazing! I love the meta nature of this story, really made creative use of Reddit formats",t3_r6xtlk
hmwcqry,t3_r6xtlk,"NTA. Your evidence, your rules.",t3_r6xtlk
hmyf56p,t3_r6xtlk,Well that was fucking great,t3_r6xtlk
hmw26xo,t3_r6xtlk,"Not really, no. While you should have asked first, you had good intentions and never harmed anybody.",t3_r6xtlk
hmxjius,t3_r6xtlk,"bruh i reached the ending and was like ""there's no way this is real""

then i looked at the subreddit",t3_r6xtlk
hmxbvza,t3_r6xtlk,"i wanna say YTA for going behind his back and looking into something he may not have wanted to know about, but now it seems like he could be hiding something scary",t3_r6xtlk
hmx4zoe,t3_r6xtlk,"I was like, ""Oh I didn't realize I was already in this sub! Sweet"" I had been thinking about joining AITA for a while cause I'm not in a lot of groups. Lol that was nice",t3_r6xtlk
hmyb9qt,t3_r6xtlk,"You're the asshole for posting the 1,237th ""AITA"" post in this sub",t3_r6xtlk
hmxnd3e,t3_r6xtlk,"Well, taking someone's DNA for testing without consent is a big no-no. But on the other hand, you may have helped catch a murderer!",t3_r6xtlk
hn00us2,t3_r6xtlk,You're the A for freaking everyone out but NTA because this was brilliant writing. lol Kudos!,t3_r6xtlk
hmwxo9l,t3_r6xtlk,"oof, this got me pretty good, nice story OP",t3_r6xtlk
hmyhsvx,t3_r6xtlk,"Never thought I would fall for this, but now I really should check what sub I'm in.",t3_r6xtlk
hmwrhsf,t3_r6xtlk,yeah i thought this was r/TrueOffMyChest and was freaking out for a minute,t3_r6xtlk
hmx50r6,t3_r6xtlk,Fuck the damn title you gave me a spook,t3_r6xtlk
hmy4acd,t3_r6xtlk,"You son of a---


I kid but seriously, you had me fooled for a minute. Well done.",t3_r6xtlk
hmyeevq,t3_r6xtlk,I just had to do a triple Whipple jackknife deluxe to figure out what sub Im in lmao.,t3_r6xtlk
hmwt9lo,t3_r6xtlk,This is creepy.,t3_r6xtlk
hmxaxgu,t3_r6xtlk,Wow.,t3_r6xtlk
hmyrgg3,t3_r6xtlk,I don't get it,t3_r6xtlk
hmzenl6,t3_r6xtlk,I am new here. What is Aita?,t3_r6xtlk
hmy0q4j,t3_r6xtlk,I need to stop reading AITA so frequently because I forgot where I was.,t3_r6xtlk
hmy1bqj,t3_r6xtlk,"Oh god, this is the first time one of these got me... gdi. 

Kudos to you, good work crafting something that was believable to me.",t3_r6xtlk
hmy3ov5,t3_r6xtlk,Yep I thought I was in a different sub,t3_r6xtlk
hmy90z0,t3_r6xtlk,Wth! I was about to say NTA and then saw the sub. Pfff got me again,t3_r6xtlk
hmyjjml,t3_r6xtlk,I DIDN'T CHECK WHAT SUB I WAS IN KSNSLSKWLWMWLWLSLWKWL,t3_r6xtlk
hn06oi1,t3_r6xtlk,I didnt pay attention to the sub and thought this was a legit problem,t3_r6xtlk
hmz7t21,t3_r6xtlk,Very good...I love it!,t3_r6xtlk
hmyseh3,t3_r6xtlk,This is a severe violation of privacy and trust. There's no other way around this. One does not go around taking DNA samples of unconsenting people.,t3_r6xtlk
hmyxkv8,t3_r6xtlk,Clever,t3_r6xtlk
hmz6kqq,t3_r6xtlk,ahhhh I actually fell for this one! Great job!,t3_r6xtlk
hmzb47z,t3_r6xtlk,"Damn, you got me. Great story.",t3_r6xtlk
hmzn45l,t3_r6xtlk,"I love the stories on the sub that pose like being from one of the drama subs, it gets me to actually read them, I know it's a gimmick but I love it, thank you. This one totally got me",t3_r6xtlk
hmznu5n,t3_r6xtlk,wait is this real or a story...I'm confused,t3_r6xtlk
hn0c9yh,t3_r6xtlk,"OMFG this was going to be the AITA sub of all subs. Like, my jaw dropped until I read the first comment and looked up to see where I was at. *CHEFS KISS",t3_r6xtlk
hn0dcl5,t3_r6xtlk,"For once I looked which sub I was on first!

So, yeah, excellent post. You're definitely gonna want to get with a lawyer and make sure you can keep the house and any assets you have because your husband is likely going to go away for a while. I wish you all the best.

I've been trying to get my husband to take his DNA test for a couple years now. Honestly, I never thought about just taking his saliva... You've definitely given me an idea or two!",t3_r6xtlk
hn0e3ia,t3_r6xtlk,Lmao I thought this was r/copypasta,t3_r6xtlk
hn0qjp1,t3_r6xtlk,Haha u got me,t3_r6xtlk
hn0qu36,t3_r6xtlk,I actually thought this is AITA sub!,t3_r6xtlk
hmwuypv,t1_hmwbu18,"Shit, same. I was confused by the last part because it was fairly innocent until then and I didn't catch the sub until I read this.",t3_r6xtlk
hmxg7p2,t1_hmwbu18,Lol so it wasn't just me. I'm like omg what?!?!,t3_r6xtlk
hmy6csd,t1_hmwbu18,"Every time with these aita on this sub. 

My heart falls to my stomach",t3_r6xtlk
hmylp42,t1_hmwbu18,"OP got me also lol For the unfamiliar, they caught the golden state killer in a similar way",t3_r6xtlk
hmz8juc,t1_hmwbu18,I thought this was AITA and was very worried lol,t3_r6xtlk
hmwi02b,t1_hmwhgd0,"There have been a number of unsolved murder cases that were solved because the murderer either took a DNA test (for something ‘fun’, like find out where your ancestors came from), or a close relative did so. 

The implication is that her husband is a murderer, and the police tracked him down because of the DNA test the wife took without his knowledge.",t3_r6xtlk
hmy62bl,t1_hmwhgd0,Ok I didn't get it either and I am deeply ashamed because I love murder shows.,t3_r6xtlk
hmxrwcy,t1_hmwvrp6,His victims his rules,t3_r6xtlk
hmxg9na,t1_hmwvrp6,Lol terrible,t3_r6xtlk
hmwnfuo,t1_hmwez0r,Normally they’re soo outrageous that you can shoot the weirdness right away. This one was so subtle that I had to look back at the sub to confirm what I was reading!,t3_r6xtlk
hn08257,t1_hmy062t,Ohhhhhh!  I get it now,t3_r6xtlk
hmwnmot,t1_hmw26xo,The husband however... happened to harm a lot of bodies!,t3_r6xtlk
hn07xa9,t1_hmyrgg3,"Me either

Edit:  Someone explained below. The husband Character is a serial killer. Cops traced him because of DNA.",t3_r6xtlk
hmzugsl,t1_hmzenl6,R/amitheasshole,t3_r6xtlk
hmzo0ld,t1_hmznu5n,never mind read some comments...all clear now 👍,t3_r6xtlk
hmxhxyt,t1_hmwi02b,"This is a new concept to me, thanks for explaining! Although I am still confused, why would having your DNA tested be flagged to the police? And why would that DNA test sample be used for unresolved murder cases?",t3_r6xtlk
hmzbkr9,t1_hmwi02b,"What’s super interesting is that it doesn’t need to be a close relative. Someone’s third cousin once removed that they have never met could take a test, and it would give investigators enough of a start to narrow it down.",t3_r6xtlk
hmxkb72,t1_hmwnfuo,"Hell, this one actually could be real - the police use 23andMe exactly this way in the real world, so it's entirely possible that one day we will read about a killer who was caught when his family decided to surprise him like this.",t3_r6xtlk
hmyluie,t1_hmwnmot,Allegedly,t3_r6xtlk
hn17uq2,t1_hn07xa9,Oh I get it. Thank you,t3_r6xtlk
hmxk86v,t1_hmxhxyt,"It's a relatively new-ish thing, I've seen instances of it happening a lot more lately. Some of the companies (I think 23 and Me does it, but Ancestry DNA does not) automatically submit their results to a system that is used by law enforcement to try and identify unknown victims and suspects that they have unmatched samples for.

That's how they managed to identify the Golden State Killer: they had his DNA sample and one of his relatives innocently took an at-home DNA test. It's honestly fascinating at all-hell to me, and I'm looking into how to sync my Ancestry DNA results to that same database used by law enforcement. Not that I think anyone in my family with one exception may actually be a killer, but if something happens to a relative I want them more easily identified.

I'll let Wikipedia explain it better:[Joseph James DeAngelo aka the Golden State Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_James_DeAngelo#Arrest_and_trial)",t3_r6xtlk
hmxjvni,t1_hmxhxyt,"https://www.ajc.com/news/national/can-police-legally-obtain-your-dna-from-23andme-ancestry/8eZ24WN7VisoQiHAFbcmjP/

The genetic information you give 23andMe and other companies like that is basically freely available to police.  I don't think they even need a warrant, they can just regularly submit samples they've collected to 23andMe just like they were sending their own in as a paying customer. So you have to assume that any information you give them will be run against law-enforcement databases looking for a match.

Even if you are a smart criminal and don't send your data off to 23andMe, if a relative of yours does, then police can [use DNA collected from your crime scene](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/investigations/the-reveal/all-in-the-family-dna-investigation/85-179895c9-1b7e-4e93-8ab4-beae25a44a79) to look for people in 23andMe's database who are related to you, and once they know who your relatives are, you're almost as good as caught.",t3_r6xtlk
hmxjxdg,t1_hmxhxyt,"Many of the largest companies that do these ancestry or paternal DNA tests have all of their information available to law enforcement. (I think when you sign up you likely agree to the terms that your test is public information or something but I’m not totally sure) That said, in some unsolved cases, they might have DNA from the crime scene, but were never able to match it to anyone and so the case remained unsolved. Law enforcement has a nationwide program where the DNA, fingerprints, etc. are kept so if DNA or a fingerprint is found at a crime scene, they can run it through the program to find a match! 

I can only assume that someone created a separate but similar program in which the DNA that is entered into these companies that do testing is cross referenced with unmatched DNA from crime scenes. This would allow law enforcement to find the perpetrator of unsolved cases if they are able to put a name to unknown DNA! 

I would be happy to explain if you have other questions! And if anything I said above is incorrect someone please let me know! I don’t have any official sources other than the fact that I watch too much forensic files and listen to too many true crime podcasts:)",t3_r6xtlk
hmzis8w,t1_hmzbkr9,"Yes, especially if it were the third cousin once removed of someone the police were already looking at. If you start looking at family trees and see a name you know…… well it’s a jumping off point for more investigation at least.",t3_r6xtlk
hn1hqy8,t1_hmxkb72,"That’s exactly why I haven’t done one yet. Once they have your DNA, the company can decide how to use it as their policies are updated.",t3_r6xtlk
hn18ciy,t1_hn17uq2,It is very clever…which I clearly am not haha. Took me a minute too,t3_r6xtlk
hmyb5z1,t1_hmxk86v,Thank you so much!,t3_r6xtlk
hmzcsjb,t1_hmxk86v,With one exception? Do tell!,t3_r6xtlk
hn0o0uv,t1_hmxk86v,Haha “with one exception”,t3_r6xtlk
hmybp5k,t1_hmxjvni,Thank you very much! This is totally new to me! Though I guess it’s because this is not a thing in the Philippines.,t3_r6xtlk
hmzqevc,t1_hmxjvni,">The genetic information you give 23andMe and other companies like that is basically freely available to police. 

Not even kinda true.

Whether this changes in the future, hard to say, but what you said is unequivocally wrong.",t3_r6xtlk
hmybat3,t1_hmxjxdg,"This is very interesting, I finally get it! Thank you!",t3_r6xtlk
hmybblf,t1_hmyb5z1,"Absolutely! I love learning new things, and am definitely a fan of sharing what I've picked up!",t3_r6xtlk
hmzd8ji,t1_hmzcsjb,"This is just sort of family lore, and there's apparently been news coverage that I've not been able to locate myself, but supposedly one of my uncles (father's half-brother) was at one point suspected of killing his business partner after said business partner went missing. From what I'd heard, the evidence was pretty damning but that pesky reasonable doubt came into play and he never served time. This was in Texas sometime in the late 80s/early 90s.",t3_r6xtlk
hmybsie,t1_hmybblf,This method is definitely helpful but I can see how it could go wrong easily. Really interesting stuff!,t3_r6xtlk
