holhpya,t3_rgnfgk,Excellent build up of tension and suspense. This was definitely a very creepy tale. Whatever that thing is outside has now moved into my imagination permanently. Very well done friend.,t3_rgnfgk
holu7nt,t3_rgnfgk,I like the plot twist - very good!!,t3_rgnfgk
holj1rw,t3_rgnfgk,I sadly did not understand this one but it did seem very scary.,t3_rgnfgk
hon9128,t3_rgnfgk,Very Weeping Angels. Is John the narrator? Why does the narration switch between first and third person?,t3_rgnfgk
honf392,t3_rgnfgk,"Since this is a writing sub and all...

Your story would really benefit if you'd use proper punctuation and a grammar checker. It's not only about the story; it's about its readability, too.

Also, the only time that *it's* is ever correct is when you're contracting  the words ""it is"" or ""it has."" Pronouns (he, she, they, it, etc.) don't use apostrophes to show possession. 

With that said, this is an excellent little tale! Nice build of suspense and anxiety!",t3_rgnfgk
hoonk3a,t3_rgnfgk,"The story itself was good but it was really confusing to figure out whether there was 2 or 3 people and kinda ruined the suspension.
Some grammar checks and final polishing and this turns from good to very good!",t3_rgnfgk
homjlx0,t3_rgnfgk,This is amazing. Really creepy.,t3_rgnfgk
homld1v,t3_rgnfgk,"I had seen a video like this on youtube a few years ago, Im pretty sure this is inspired from the several versions of the famous horror topic ""Don't look away!""",t3_rgnfgk
holi1pe,t1_holhpya,Thank you,t3_rgnfgk
holmevv,t1_holj1rw,Spooky monster man with restless leg syndrome doing spooky stuff that gets blamed on boyfriend. Tale as old as time.,t3_rgnfgk
holu5ll,t1_holj1rw,"There was a monster tapping on the window that the bf couldn't look away from or else it would come closer, but the gf thought the tapping was just him and that he was ""distracted"" from the movie. At the end, the bf finally looked away and at his phone, allowing the monster the chance to disappear. The gfs comments about the window at the end shows that she thinks it's the bf opening the window but (since the bf is still downstairs) it's actually the monster.",t3_rgnfgk
honeuav,t1_hon9128,itâ€™s all from johns view going from present to a retelling of what he had seen shortly before.,t3_rgnfgk
homaf6m,t1_holmevv,Restless leg syndrome is horrific in itself.,t3_rgnfgk
hoodfzz,t1_holmevv,Oh LMAO,t3_rgnfgk
hoodk21,t1_holu5ll,OHHH wow!! That's super scary!!!,t3_rgnfgk
honh71i,t1_honeuav,So John just talks about himself in the third person?,t3_rgnfgk
hoovltx,t1_honh71i,Never mind I see what you are talking about that was a slip up on my part,t3_rgnfgk
