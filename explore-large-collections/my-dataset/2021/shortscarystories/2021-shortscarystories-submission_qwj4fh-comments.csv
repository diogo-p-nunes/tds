hl47ph2,t3_qwj4fh,"Dear Framed,

The first thing you should is dispute those charges with your credit card honey!  That will trigger an investigation by their fraud department and you may get lucky and get this whole thing cracked open for you!  Hope that helps, and best of luck with your upcoming revenge-murder spree and all that. I just think holding on to your hobbies and the things that make you happy are SO important as we age. 

Regards,
Advice giving Amy",t3_qwj4fh
