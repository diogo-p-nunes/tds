**HYPER’S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#8:** KAUAN - Ice Fleet

**Genre:** Doom Metal, Neo-Folk, Post-Rock

Atmospheric Post-Rock, with hints of Neo-Folk and Doom from a Russian band, living in Estonia, with lyrics in Finnish? Sign me up! 

I came across a review for this album by chance, and I was immediately hooked when I learned it’s a concept piece detailing the discovery of a fleet of ships frozen in ice off the coast of Russia. I won’t spoil too much, but if you’re into Dyatlov Pass-like mysteries, this one will be right up your alley.

The album itself is mesmerizing, eerie, beautiful, and does an amazing job of transporting the listener to the barren arctic wastes, filling you with dread and woe and wonder and sadness along the way. 

For the story I let the atmosphere and flow of the music dictate the setting and feel, not thinking *too* much about borrowing elements from the concepts unveiled in the album itself. I wanted freezing cold and a dark fate. 

**Favorite Track:** Just listen to the whole thing, please!

**Album Rating:** 10/10 Frozen Peas",t3_rb0nnr

hnmsjuy,t3_rb0nnr,"Tbh, I don't think this is your best work.  The beginning is great, but then it gets confusing and distracting.  As always, you have good writing skills though.",t3_rb0nnr

hnlqhwq,t1_hnlqbpx,"Thank you so much, Simba, I really appreciate it ;)",t3_rb0nnr
hnmdhvl,t1_hnmc9y0,"Hahaha, that's alright, this one isn't super straight-forward I guess, more of a weird, intriguing conceptual thing. The implication is that we find versions of our future selves frozen solid, and we are getting closer to the eve of this assumed cataclysmic event (10 years in the future).",t3_rb0nnr
hnmho7n,t1_hnmh0es,Thank you so much! It's definitely on my list of concepts I might just expand upon in the future ;),t3_rb0nnr

hnogfwf,t1_hnmbqel,*crunch crunch crunch crunch*,t3_rb0nnr
hnog6eq,t1_hnodfaz,"I’m iron deficient anemic, yes. So’s my dad, and my uncle, and my grandma, and so on so forth. I’m pale as a ghost (lockdown plus anemia equals oh good lord I’ve become a vampire), get short of breath easily, and go through trays of ice cubes in a day.

Oddly enough, I don’t have brittle nails.",t3_rb0nnr
hnmruff,t1_hnmdhvl,Oooh I see. But there’s a time travel aspect then right?,t3_rb0nnr
hnmefx7,t1_hnme1x1,Truly one of the best writers I have discovered in years and I missed your posts but also knew with all the content you were creating you would need a break. Lol I'm also a geek because I get excited when you answer 😁,t3_rb0nnr
hnmyolr,t1_hnmczwy,Ah. Would I be wrong in guessing that some of those bodies in the ice... thawed out early?,t3_rb0nnr

hnmf843,t1_hnmefx7,"Yeah, I'm pretty bad at reading the signs of a burnout - a skill I'll be looking into improving moving forward ;)

And I'm just super honored to be among your favorite writers, truly!",t3_rb0nnr
hnmzj7n,t1_hnmyolr,Not a bad assumption at all ;),t3_rb0nnr
hnmzgev,t1_hnmyddp,"Hahaha, I love that!",t3_rb0nnr
hnnd4oi,t1_hnmf843,I am also a master at working to burnout. 160 hours every 2 weeks sure I can do that. Worked 4 months 7 days a week 16 hour shifts then needed a 4 week mental health break. I wish mine was creative genius but instead it's just not being able to say no when help is needed.,t3_rb0nnr
hnnffs3,t1_hnnd4oi,"Damn, that sounds incredibly taxing, friend. I hope you remember to take care of yourself too!",t3_rb0nnr
hnnjspu,t1_hnnffs3,"I left that job in group homes for disabled adults earlier this summer. I now have a ""regular"" job, Monday-Friday 7:45a-4:15p. I make less because I don't have all the overtime but I'm not slowly killing myself so I'm all about it now. Many group homes are short staffed in America and then with COVID people were leaving because they didn't want to work with sick clients. Pay is horrible so you don't end up with good staff. It's very sad for the people that live in the homes

Edit: I have been in social services working with people with disabilities and mental health issues for about 20 years I love the work and I love the clients but I couldn't do the low paying crap hours anymore. Now I work in a medical clinic and assist a neurologist so I guess I'm still helping people",t3_rb0nnr
