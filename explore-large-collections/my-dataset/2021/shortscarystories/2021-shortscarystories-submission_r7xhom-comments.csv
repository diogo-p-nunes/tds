hn249hb,t1_hn23bwy,"Thanks for reading. 

The story makes a lot more sense once you know what ""Affirmative Action"" is :)",t3_r7xhom
hn2iqty,t1_hn2ebpu,"Sure. John was being an asshat at a work dinner party. Colin prayed for divine intervention. John was consumed instantly by a bolt of fire.

I’ll leave it to you to figure out exactly how John was being an asshat😎😎",t3_r7xhom
hn4e3rh,t1_hn4a64c,Ikr 😼 ☄️,t3_r7xhom

hn24x4r,t1_hn249hb,"I mean, I do know what it is. I suppose I’m just a little lost in the details. Why do they keep eating like it never happened? I think I can see a bit of the intention here, like it’s a whitewashed dinner party and it’s an act of “affirmative action” by god to strike down the racist dude talking about Affirmative Action. I just don’t really get how it all connects I guess?",t3_r7xhom
hn77a0u,t1_hn2iqty,But affirmative action is a good thing,t3_r7xhom
hn26bfl,t1_hn24x4r,"They kept eating like it never happened because a/maybe it didn’t happen and it was Colin’s wishful thinking 
b/maybe they were happy John had shut up and they could eat in peace😊

Take your pick😀
Also, you summed the story very well, it sounds like you do absolutely “get it” and you’re not as confused as you think!!🥸🥸",t3_r7xhom
hn78ztt,t1_hn77a0u,"Yes. But John doesn’t like affirmative action. He was complaining about affirmative action, insinuating that Colin was hired just because of affirmative action. That’s why Colin prayed to shut him up.",t3_r7xhom
hn29n7k,t1_hn26bfl,"Oh okay. Thanks for your time and patience!

hn6obt8,t1_hn26bfl,I prefer option b! John sounds absolutely awful!!,t3_r7xhom
hn79xdp,t1_hn78ztt,"Ah okay, I was very confused by the wording",t3_r7xhom
