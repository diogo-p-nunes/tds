hl0u0ft,t3_qw68bo,"Sure, parts can be trimmed a bit and omitted along the lines of 'show don't tell', but I like the mystery involved, asking questions, the confusion etc. Good job.

I dunno if the comma's you used were supposed to be full stops, and if they are that's okay. If they ain't, switch 'em out.",t3_qw68bo
hl0wkzj,t1_hl0u0ft,"Thank you for liking it, and I admit, I think I don't know when to use a full stop instead of a comma lol, I'm going to work on fixing that, and also, thank you for taking the time to give your thoughts, It means a lot!",t3_qw68bo
hl0wyni,t1_hl0wkzj,"S'all good. The best advice I can give is to read similar work, and Keep at it. Then, write some more.",t3_qw68bo
