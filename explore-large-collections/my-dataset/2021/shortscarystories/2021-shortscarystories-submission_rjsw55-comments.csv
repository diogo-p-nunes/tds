**HYPER’S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#2:** Harakiri For the Sky - Mære

**Genre:** Post-Black / Black Metal

Harakiri For the Sky’s Mære feels like a soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It flows from one scene to the next, and never really lets you go - and why would you even want to? I’ve yet to find any weakness in this album, and it’s just one of those I can listen to on repeat for days, without ever feeling bored.

For the story I chose the very literal meaning of the word Mære (Mare - a creature from norse/slavic/germanic folklore), attempting to find a fun and unusual way to build a story around it - and since I hadn't done a review-type story in a while, I figured what the heck. 

And, fun fact, the description of the Mære is from my very own sleep paralysis experience.

Never detooth a gift horse’s mouth, or so the saying goes!

**Favorite Track:** It's too hard to choose just one!

**Album Rating:** 10/10",t3_rjsw55
