f8dj8ng,t1_f86a2e4,"I liked your story. It would have helped, the reader, if you had used some punctuation. When sentences run on without stopping between completed thoughts, it is hard to follow the story line. Many people will stop reading, when the writing is hard to understand, not because of the difficult vocabulary, but because it is harder to read something that, you the reader, has to come up with the logical pauses that the writer intended. You have some good ideas.  I know that you will gain many up votes in the future, once you put in the periods, commas, etc., that will make your stories more clear.",t3_dysjyg
