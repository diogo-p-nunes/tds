Steve aside, as someone that frequently suffer from sleep paralysis, this is a realllyyyy terrifying story. I love the writing and the description of the thing. I also like the progression towards insanity. Good story!",t3_edjgj0

Thank you for reading and expressing your enjoyment! I see you comment a lot and I definitely enjoy receiving them as well as reading your take on other stories. Keep it up and thank you!

I had a period where I would repeatedly be trapped in sleep paralysis. I think I may have actually toned down the scare factor on that part a bit subconsciously for fear that I may make someones struggle worse. Fortunately mine seemed to be medication induced and subsided when I was able to discontinue the medication. I can honestly say that it was one of the most terrifying things that I've ever experienced. The thought hit me while writing this that maybe it still happens, but I just don't remember it...

I remember that when I found out that the condition had a name and that others experienced it, I felt a lot better about it, less afraid of it. That combined with the Druid's dialogue in his final scene ""Garm Wars: The Last Druid"" was my inspiration for this one.",t3_edjgj0

My sleep paralysis only occurs when it's night and I am stressed. One time, I was lying on bed face down to a pillow, and suddenly I can't move. Really thought I was gonna die, or am possesed by some demon or something, but nope, it's just an experience and I was glad too knowing I'm not being haunted by a ghost!

I hope you're okay now, and are not suffering from it anymore. Thank you for the story and for telling me about your experience with sleep paralysis too!",t3_edjgj0
fbjbdw4,t1_fbj8vwr,"Hahaha! I choked on my coffee a bit at Spooky McEvil...

Mine seemed to be stress induced as well, I also thought of a demonic presence or haunting! I’m glad I haven’t had it (or don’t remember having it) for a while now! I hope yours goes away also!

Your welcome! And Thank You again!",t3_edjgj0
