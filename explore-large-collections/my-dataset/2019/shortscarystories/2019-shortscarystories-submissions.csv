My name is Sheldon Blanche, I live in EdKin, Ohio. I'm a twenty year old college...dropout, but I'm not a dumbass or anything. Well I guess I am, I had to drop out because I was too lazy to go down to the gas station for a pack of condom. I have to support my now pregnant girlfriend, Shawna.

I usually walk every night from my house to the train station at late hours. Recently I've been cutting through a park a block or two away from our apartment building. No one is out there at that time of night so its basically just twenty minutes of me letting my mind rest before I had to use it at work. This night, I turn the corner onto the ave. I always did and walk into the park. I got a few feet in when I see a black shadow in the shape of a man, I couldn't be sure because the person is too far away. I hadn't faced this problem before, but I did from my line of work know how to look intimidating.

I pick my head up and place a mean mug on my face. However, I soon dropped that look and replace it with one of confusion. The further I walk down the beaten path the closer I get to them, I could hear...singing.

Yes singing, and it wasn't your average get down and boogie song. This song unnerved the hell out of me, it isn't a song you could recognize because the person was speaking complete gibberish set to a melody. The person threw their arms in the air, and I mean, literally, they stretch them more than humanly possible. Coming closer I could see it was a guy and he's a heavy set man, with bare BLOODY feet, his disheveled fog like Sandy brown hair is hidden underneath a torn filthy dodgers cap, he wears a dark brown plaid shirt, and tattered jeans.

I didn't know if I should walk past him or not, he stopped doing everything when I walked up so he had to have sensed my presence. As I weigh my options, a light hit me in the face. The shine is coming from the street light he was under, it beamed off the...blade he was holding...an eight inch bowie knife....he must've pulled it out when I was deep in thought.

I froze, and before you comment saying I should've just backed tracked, shut the hell up. You don't get to give me advice if you haven't experienced this, this level of fear. I didn't know what this guy plan to do, he just stares at the night's sky holding the knife, tightening his grip around the handle.

Suddenly he turns his head, his dark brown eyes locked with my pale blue ones. A devilish grin takes over his face as he turns his body, now he's completely facing my direction. His eyes have pure joy in them, I saw the man had a deeply carved glasgow smile from ear to ear, he takes a step towards me muttering.

""Glasgow KISSS, make your world one of BLISSS."""

I always drink coffee before I go to sleep but my father this time said no for this habit. He said it's something not good for my health. 

What can I do? What can I do, I am just 9. My mother on the other hand just finished cleaning up my older brother, he's 10, for sleep. It's 8 o'clock at the night. 

She assists him on his bedroom and kissed his forehead. She then approached me asking why I am still up. She then carry me on my bedroom and kissed my forehead.

""Go to sleep now, my dear.""

I closed my eyes but I am not sleeping. I want to wait until tomorrow. I want to be awake until twelve. Until my birthday.

But I can't help being sleepy that time. The hours goes by and it's morning. 

Unlike my older brother that celebrates his birthday last four months—

I just realize that I am born not even 9 months after my mother gave birth to my brother. Maybe that's why I always felt that I am left behind. Maybe that's why.

The day has passed without a single word I hear about my birthday. 

Until I woke up. 

*sigh*

I really hope that's not a dream for I have a reason to kill them all. 

I really hope that bastard allow me to drink my coffee."

It was supposed to be haunted. Apparently every inhabitant that lived there for more than a month has died. I love the supernatural and so decided to move in. Don't judge me.

I quite enjoy sitting in the closet. It's got a false back and there's a small room behind it. There's the faded markings of a pentagram and what looks to be blood.

Anyway I sit down in the centre of the circle and play my music. For some reaon my headphones only play static so I have to burn my music to a CD and play it on a small CD player. It works fine usually.

Anyway it must be really good with the surround sound. It was only a few bucks used but some of the noises and screeches are really good. I'm sure I couldn't hear some before. Just shows how important good audio is. I tend to close my eyes while listening and you can really hear the demonic screeching and growls. Just today I was listening to Hard Rock Hallelujah (guilty pleasure, what can I say) and there was this amazing growling during the organ bit at the start. I absolutely love it. Absolutely terrifying. It sent goosebumps down my spine. Though I'm not sure what the three sharp pokes on my neck were. Maybe my muscles were rocking out too?"
ei42dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ei42dv/jogging_with_my_friend/,Jogging with my friend,12,1,1577805246.0,"I usually jog alone but a guy I use to know from school messaged me on Facebook wanting to start jogging with me. He was an old friend of mine and he never really was into sports. I remember in school that he never took part in sports especially those that required lots of running. He never told us if he had any disability which made him not able to do much sports. Any how I agreed that he could jog with me and I was excited with catching up with him. When the day of the jogging came, he warned me that it was important that we both jogged at the same pace and that neither of us could jog too fast or too slow.

His tone seemed serious like it was a matter of life and death. As we started jogging he was completely silent and there was this awkwardness in the air that I couldn't get rid of. I started to become curious and decided to jog a little faster than him and as soon as I did that my friend started shouting ""you have any idea what you have done. I have a condition that if anyone is jogging or running in front of me I become a monster that starts chasing them and they become the prey that runs away!""

My friend turned into a monster and he was chasing me and in his monster form he was trying to grab hold of me. I then ducked as he tried to grab me in his monster form and he was now in front of me and I was behind him while still jogging. Then as my friend turned normal he still shouted at me ""no no no now that your behind me and im jogging faster than you it will make you the monster and me the victim""

My body started transforming and it was so painful and even though I knew I was a monster my human side was imprisoned inside the mind of a monster. I could see myself in monster form chasing down my friend who wasn't use to sprinting and I tried to stop myself but couldn't. I killed him as I grabbed him and when he died I transformed back into a human. 

My friend before fully dying smiled at me and told me that it was my curse now. 

No one else was around and I walked back home. I hate this curse. Even when someone walks past me a bit faster than me I could feel the monster inside me nearly coming out. I am trapped."

He tells me that what happens in his house stays in his house as he cracks my ribs with his over sized knuckles. 

I know I can’t tell my dad about moms evil friend because they will take my dad away. Sometimes I think mom is the evil one. Evil spreads. 

The evil man pulled out a gun and put it to my moms head. I dialed the only number on the phone that I thought could help. 

The evil man went away, but he will be back. Evil always comes back and evil always spreads. 

...

Today the evil man gets released from prison. He goes back to that hell that was his house when he destroyed my family. 

The evil man spread his evil to me, and for 20 years all I could think about is releasing the evil but nobody deserves it like he does. 

Today, the only thing that will spread is his blood on the floor that was once soaked in my blood. 
For what happens today, stays in this house.

Soon it would become one more star in the inky void. But it too had to disappear, to drown in the all-encompassing cosmic expanse.  

The big question for the man growing up was whether life existed elsewhere in the universe. *Death in the universe seems the more likely now,* he thought with sordid amusement.  

He wished there was someone, something to talk to. Hell, he wished there was at all anything to say. But it was an irrelevant notion. The crackling rattle of his depleting oxygen seemed to mockingly remind him of that. 

So, he turned inward. *Think now, or forever hold your peace.*

ei0zrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ei0zrt/he_kept_his_calm/,He kept his calm,120,10,1577786613.0,"When his pregnant wife’s labour started one month early, he kept his calm. He had a mission. He drove her to the hospital among cries of pain and insults to the feminine condition, amidst the rain and the wind.

When the doctors told him that the baby was in the wrong way and couldn’t come out, that they would have to operate, he kept his calm. He trusted them to help her to the best of their abilities.

When they told him that something was deeply wrong and she was dying, he kept his calm. It felt surreal. He called his in-laws, who were already on their way from three states away, and announced them the news in an awfully cool voice to his own ears.

*“She won’t die”*, his mother-in-law told him. *“I promise you this. But you have to act quick. Tell the doctors to enact emergency code 77-77. They will understand. No one, including you, the baby or doctors, must be in the same room as her when she bleeds out. You get me? No one!”*

As she screamed, he kept his calm. As he repeated her words to the security team, he kept his calm. It seemed like someone knew what was going on. A phone call was made, the room was evacuated, and security teams showed up.

When they fled from the operation room with his son in their arms, when they locked it behind them and posted armed men to prevent entry, he managed to keep his calm. There was no way he could fight them.

But when they took him to a small chamber next to his wife’s, when they refused to let him see his baby, when they locked him up and started questioning him, he almost lost it.

*“Did she ever bite you? Scratch you? Was the sex rough? Was she violent, mistreating you or anyone around you? Prone to anger?”*

And hours later, even the calming texts from his mother-in-law did not calm him. As he curled in a ball and cried, the sounds coming from his wife’s room - growls, scratches, cries - even as they proved she was alive, did not calm him. The knowledge that he was a father did not calm him, nor the thought that he would finally learn what was weird with her and her family.

No, what calmed him was a low hum coming from the window. He rose and watched as much as the closed blinds allowed him too.

It came from the sky. It calmed him.

And there he stayed, awaiting nothing, aware of nothing, staring at the full moon that rose above the clouds. It was so god damn beautiful."

Just a sense of blankness. If she had an emotion, it was a vague pleasure at the sudden, welcome silence. A silence that now stretched forward for years.

Mostly, though, she wasn't there. She was oddly disconnected from herself, watching from a distance without much interest. On some level, perhaps she was aware that this was a memory she'd have to delete. She'd need to not remember this, need to be distraught and shocked and horrified. Then there'd be no more questions. Just silence. Years of peaceful silence.

Was she even awake? She hadn't been a few minutes ago; she wouldn't be a few minutes from now. Maybe this was all just a dream. The kind of dream you don't remember on waking up.

She'd wake up and be shocked by reality, because this was just a dream she'd forget. That felt right. That felt easy to believe.

So in that moment, she just held the pillow down hard, until the tiny little feet stopped kicking, stopped twitching, and sank into utter stillness.

And she went back to bed, knowing she wouldn't be woken up again."

When I was in kindergarten, there was a kid who would keep taking my toy away from me before I could play with it. I was constantly contemplating grabbing the toy from him so I could have it for myself. I wanted it for myself.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

When I was in elementary school, I was being picked on by an older kid. He would call me names, push me, shove me, hit me, do everything he could to make me feel absolutely pitiful. I always wanted to be able to fight back, to hurt him the same way he's always hurt me.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

When I was in middle school, I had a crush on a girl. Soon enough, I had finally worked together enough courage to ask her out. But when I tried to tell her how I felt, she called me gross and shoved me in front of all of her friends. I wanted to push her back for rejecting me like that. I wanted to shove her for breaking my dreams with her own selfishness.

But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right.

I'm in high school now. I had a friend who I always vented all of my personal problems to. I *had* a friend who would listen to everything I've been through. And he betrayed me. We got in a fight, and he got his revenge by posting an embarrassing story about me on social media. It spread through the school like wildfire. And now I'm a laughing stock.

But now, I come to school, finally able to fight back.

Now, I come to school, finally able to get the revenge I've always been itching to get.

Now, I come to school, knowing deep down that I'm wrong.

Two wrongs don't make a right, they always told me.

ehz192,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ehz192/perspective/,Perspective,15,4,1577773258.0,"Have you ever wondered what exactly you'd think, say and do if you ever met you? I'm talking about a living, breathing replica of you. A doppelganger. A perfect ""me-too"". I'm sure at some point you've met someone whom others have easily mistaken for you...as I did today. 

I was heading off for work when it clicked to me as I stepped off the porch that I'd forgotten my phone. I sprinted back to my room and as I threw the door open...that's when I saw him, turning to meet me as he swung my sports bag over his shoulder. That's when he saw me. We locked each other in gaze for a solid minute or two, my mind and body abuzz with some blend of anxiety and childlike curiosity. For some reason he doesn't scare me and I feel like I know that he belongs, and that he shouldn't, all the same.

His eyebrows arch in suspicion, eyes widened. Is this how I really look when I'm startled? Is this what my face looks like beyond me? ""I'm...uhh...I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong house, buddy"" I awkwardly manage. ""Yeah,"" he replies. ""You too, probably."" His voice stirred up an inexplicable rage within me. A part of me knew that this was my voice. Another part of me was pretty damn annoyed that I sound like I'm talking with a dick in my mouth. 

""Umm...anyway, sorry about...whatever the fuck this is, I guess?"" Those are the last of his words as I watch him walk right past me, out of the room, with a weirdly familiar shrug of my shoulders. I know that he's wearing my cologne. I did not know that it could smell so different to someone else when it's on my body. I've never smelt myself like this before. Nor have I ever seen or heard of me from these angles beyond myself. I shake my head as I hear him exit through the front door. I can tell that his footsteps end abruptly as he meets the porch, and I've got this really weird sense that I'm forgetting something. I turn to face my closet. The door to my room swings open."

Dogs are cool but how can someone talk about one for 30 minutes? Maybe I was just being grouchy.

I kept up your standard banter, and talked a bit about my interests. I couldn't help but think this would be our only date, this woman seemed like her entire personality was made of plastic, so basic. My mind was also in other places. Recently I had gotten a well, follower. The unwanted kind. I had first noticed someone following me. The same three cars following me, love letters in the mail. It's hard to go get a casual hookup when you don't know if someone may be watching from a tree.

The night progressed and we left the restaurant. We took things back to her house. Another tally for my unhealthy sex habits I guessed. We got inside her house and I noticed she was locking all her doors and drawing her curtains. Then she asked; "" Well Han, how are your orchids?"" No one who hadn't been to my house would know about my orchids. Then it dawned on me. She kept going; "" I have a rather extensive collection of dates stored in my attic, you'll be joining them soon."" I had to stifle my laughter. She noticed my silence and asked; ""What, cat got your tongue?"" I replied ""Well if you were a half good stalker, or serial killer, you would've known that I'm a fucking hit man, god lady even your crimes are uninteresting. SO basic."" She looked a bit shocked, and started to reach for a drawer on her table. She wasn't slick as she tried to pull out a gun. I shot first. I left a sufficient amount of evidence for what she did in her free time out, and called the police on her phone, then I decided to call it a night and walk home."

ehutbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ehutbi/screen_time/,Screen Time,15,7,1577751800.0,"""I feel like we would see some rendering issues if we lived in the matrix."" My roommate droned as he stared at the television we had mounted in the middle of our dorm. He curled his hand around his small glass pipe and took another hit. ""Like, you ever been wandering around in GTA and some low LOD hooker wanders by? Imagine how much that would fuck you up seeing that in real life."" He watched with glassy eyes as I failed once again to jump a virtual stolen car over a fence.

""The fuck is LOD?"" I asked out of polite Borden. I abandoned my car and went to look for a new one.

""Level of detail"" he exhaled with a fresh cloud. ""Like if you go into the strip club mini game and you're up close with an NPC, everything will be so detailed that you'll be able to see pores around the nipple, but if that same character is 100 yards away, she'll be reduced down to simple shapes and get some Laura Croft titties.""

There was a moment of silence where he seemed to be lost in thoughts of angular breasts. Slightly uncomfortable and slightly intrigued, I broke his concentration. ""Why do they do that?""

He slowly cranked his head around to face me instead of the screen. ""It saves on processing power. Making a sphere takes a lot of different polygons, it's hard for the lighting engine to work around all those angles and then you have to worry about fluid dynamics if she starts bouncing."" Another pause as he stared off into the middle distance. I took the moment to grab the bowl and take a hot for myself. ""Having a flat surface with a simple texture is a lot easier for the processor to manage.""

I finally managed the jump over the fence and raced it toward one of the waiting jet fighters. After a drawn out animation of my character ripping at the door I was gunned down. My roommate stirred again.

""I once saw this gif of a game engine loading and deleting things in real time as the player looked around the world."" He was prone to stoned lecturing. Sometimes it was a lecture on the girls I've been talking to, sometimes muddled politics, sometimes rankins of frozen pizza. Apparently tonight's speech was sponsored by his computer science 101 course. ""The game just deleted anything out of the scene that the player wasn't looking at so it wouldn't have to render useless points. I think the even designed levels so the player would walk past high detail set pieces and spend most of their time in dungeons with just four, easy to render, blank walls.""

I was beginning to feel the weed too at this point. My reflexes were slowed down to the point that I could no longer jump into the high speed car chases. ""So the developers spent years building beautiful set pieces and then shove the player into a blank room just to save on FPS?"" I was suddenly aware of how bleak our small cinder block dorm was. ""If that's all they care about, why bother with the 3D world at all? Why not just push people into a simple 2D world?""

The blazed college philosopher scratched his chin, trying to imagine his play as a human enslaving robot. ""People evolved to live in a 3D world. It's what comes naturally to us. We would go crazy in just 2D."" He dug out the cached bowl and repacked it. ""I guess ontop of all the other things they could just design the game so the player spends most of their time looking at simple, 2D objects."" 

I handed off the controller to my dorm mate. ""How the hell would you do that?"" I asked just before I jumped ship from the conversation. My roommate rambled on, but I was a little too gone to join in. I spent the rest of the night srating at my phone."
ehum1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ehum1a/virgins/,Virgins,8,0,1577750843.0,"  
We were living in your house and were there when you came to see the house with the so-called estate agent. We monsters as you call us are not ugly, in fact, we are selected on our good looks, the better we look the better are we able to sell houses!  


Most 'monsters' of our kind will be just home owners wanting to sell and move on. On to greener pastures, greener virgins! Some of us are estate agents.  


It is not easy these days to find a real virgin and we need virgin blood to survive. The virgin in her new house will serve to feed my family one time, or for a very long time if she wants to feed us. But virgins do not remain virgins very long. And the fourteen year old girls you believe are still free of the love of men more often are not. They have been taken already.  


Promiscuity is a bad thing and priests, uncles, cousins, granddads or even daddies themselves are often found guilty of deflowering a virgin family member. So there I am, selling a nice family house to a nice family with an eleven, twelve or thirteen year old girl. But at her fourteenth birthday instead of getting sweet, nutritious virgin blood, we have to make do with the sour blood of a deflowered girl. So we try to meet the girl young and tell her to keep her virginity until the famed day.  


It is not so easy to come back to people who believe you are their estate agent and try to become friends of the family, but sometimes it works out well. Especially if the family just moved in to a new town or city and have no local connections, no friends in the neighborhood. That family will find it a relief to take us into their home at times. They invite us for dinner or lunch.  


Late night dinners are nice because you can suck some blood off a grandmother or a mother after a few glasses of wine. She will not notice and the dehydration and headache will be blamed on the hangover. The men in a household are usually careful of their women. So we only suck from the wife if they both fall asleep late at night.  


Their blood will only last for a few days, so we need a lot of friends to stay alive. Virgin blood will keep us cool for nearly a year, and she does not notice too much. If she stays a virgin after her fourteenth birthday we can enjoy more years together. If she is willing to join us, all the better!  


Your estate agent has a very good looking ‘daughter’ just a few years older than yours, do make friends, we bloody love it!"

While the inside is desolate as well, countless of little treasures are brought over, gifted to families and lovers. Chunks of stone and concrete, ancient screws and nails, to be tied to jewels and necklaces as tokens of luck and magic. 

All who can climb cross the wall, to dig the dirt, raiding the area more and more barren, taking along the tokens they can. But for ten years the elders study the scriptures. Once two have been solved, they learn: all the scriptures stare the same.

The creature spreads throughout the room, hanging upon every nook and cranny like hellish Christmas decorations, rotting from generations past. No one has seen beyond its shadow. Only when you sleep do you see its real form.


Laying on your back, looking so at the ceiling. The air prickles like icicles. You are not alone. Up in the dreaded corner, you see him.


A long body with naked limbs and a scaly body. Sweat falls onto you, giving you a wretched answer to the cold prickling. 


A face that had a wide, crooked, toothless grin and two beady eyes that lusted for blood.


Its neck defies its own form, stretching itself like a slug until it meets the end of your bed. Now his body is nonexistent; only a nub of flesh remains. It starts to crawl to come together with its head.


It rises, a cobra of disgusting proportions. The moment to strike is awaiting its foul hunger. The face leans in, ignoring your silent but terrified efforts to run.


“Now has come the time to play,” he rasps, “and you shall be my toy. The man is finally finished making you into my image. You have been a very naughty dolly...you wouldn’t want to break again, would you?”


He wraps around you, his flesh all but merging with yours.


“*Mrs. Polly had a dolly who was SICK, SICK, SICK*

*So she called for the doctor to come QUICK, QUICK, QUICK*

*He came with his BAG and he came with his HAT*

*And he hid in the corner to KILL THE BRAT!*”


His own body sunk into yours, smothering you into the inky darkness below the covers. He slithered away once the deed had been done.


“Dolly, dolly, dolly...”"

Is it my imagination that shows me the man covered in blood? 

My family is gone, the house flooded with blood. My family never believed I saw things they couldn’t. I always heard voices and saw things I shouldn’t. 

But now they are gone, and there’s a man in my yard covered in my families blood. 

They should’ve listened to me when I said it was real. Losing my family was something I feared. 

What’s next? Well I guess I should go inside and wash the blood off my clothes, take care of the bodies so they’re no longer exposed.

I’m late.

“You’re getting fat,” she says.

“Mom! It’s just the coat. It’s freezing outside!”

She sighs, like she always does when she’s in the wrong.

“You look like a turkey,” she continues. “A stuffed turkey.”

Mom’s stressed over Christmas.

We drive to the mall in silence. She catches me looking at a group of colt-legged girls walking through the drifting snow.

“How will you ever meet a nice girl if you don’t take care of yourself?”

“Mom” —

“Lawrence, I’m worried about you. About your future.”

I don’t reply. I think of the forum, of the supportive messages. Of Omar.

*I’m proud of you son,* he’d said. 

*You’re special.*

We park and get out. I tell Mom I want to check out Santa. She rolls her eyes but says nothing.

Inside it’s warm. Christmas decorations are everywhere. My bulky coat looks absurd.

We walk past Santa on the way to the supermarket. A large plastic tree, a long line of kids. Under the tree, some washed-up actor in red clothes and a fake white beard.

I’m pink-faced and sweaty. It’s so hot in my coat.

When I stop, Mom sighs again. “Larry, I’m going to get the turkey,” she says. Then: “You really *do* have to grow up.”

She waddles off, her big butt swaying in her leggings.

She always wears leggings, even when it’s cold.

It’s cheap. I told Omar and he agreed.

*Whoreish*, he called it.

I stand next to Santa. He’s young and annoyed by the kids around him.

He looks at me. “Aren’t you too big for this?” he whispers. There’s alcohol on his breath.

Omar’s right. It’s filthy. Perverse.

*That’s why you’re special*, he’d said. *It’s rare for one of you to find the truth*.

I’m sweating heavily.

*With your blue eyes and blond hair, nobody will suspect*.

The colt-legged girls from before come into the mall.

Omar, Omar, I know you’re right, but I’m scared, my hand is on the zip but I can’t move —

The girls come closer. A little boy in a red jumper sits on Santa’s knee.

*Ho ho ho.*

One of the girls is wearing leggings. Just like Mom.

I think of Mom buying a big, fat turkey. She’ll stuff it while she tells me, Larry you disappointment, Larry you with your big belly and your PS4 games and Pornhub and —

I tear open the zip. My coat opens to reveal the thick slabs of explosives coated with nails.

They all stare, open-mouthed. They see me now, Santa and the woman with the leggings, they see me for what I have become these last few months on the forum.

Not one of the lost, but one of the found. Not a soul in turmoil, but a seeker of paradise. Not a sheep, but a lion.

A beautiful, wrathful lion.

“Alhamdulillah!” I scream and grip the detonator. “Merry Christmas, filthy kuffir pigs!”

I press the button."

I'll be in Macy's"" she called out, waving as she pulled off. Not wanting to interact with anyone I went to the kiosk and put in my order. 

   ""Oh how do you work this damned thing.."" a gruff voice mumbled, pressing all the buttons, racking up a considerable amount. I looked over at the man, roughly early 30s, thick curls. I watched him mumble for a few more moments before walking over. ""Would you like some help?""  I smiled up at him. He looked down at me in surprise ""oh yes please. I'm not use to these machines."" He chuckles, flashing his pearly whites. I deleted the extra orders and customized the one he wanted. ""Thank you very much."" He held his receipt and looked around, he clocked the charm bracelet on my arm. ""Are you a fan of Jem too? My daughter loves Synergy."" He says, presumably talking about the one who was standing next to him. She was about 9, large brown eyes and long cascading hair. Wearing purple overalls and a long sleeved white turtleneck,  although it was summer. Her face was dirty with caked on mud and dust that fell when she turned her head. ""Yeah Jem is truly outrageous."" I smiled at the girl and waved. She didn't wave back but stared up at him silently. Typical kid. Maybe she was tired, the dark circles under her eyes were a good sign.
""I like a lot or older cartoons, but the ones made now are good too."" I shrugged and we began to talk. 

   He was funny and recommended me some cartoons I had never heard of. Getting our food at roughly the same time, we all walked out together. The young girl staying at her father's side, still not talking. ""Where ya headed?"" He asked once in the parking lot. ""Just to the mall."" I nodded to the mall that was maybe a five minute walk. ""Oh I'm heading there, want a ride?"" He unlocked his Prius, standing next to the drivers door. ""Uh.."" I thought about it. Five minute walk vs a thirty second drive. The girl finally stopped staring at her father and looked me straight in the eyes, she shook her head the slightest bit. *No.* She mouthed silently, dirt spilling from her mouth over her cracked lips.
""I'm good. I need the exercise."" I laughed, nervously. 
He cocked his head, ""you sure? It's no trouble for me, really."" He took a step forward, placing his McDonald's bag on the roof of the car. 
""Thank you but I'm ok. Have a good one!"" I turned down the road and ran. I ran as fast as my legs could take me. "

At first it scared me, my brain not being able to process what the hell I was seeing. After a while I started to make up conversations. Nothing weider than laying in bed, looking at your Jonathan Taylor Thomas poster and imaging an entire conversation.

As I got older the imaginary conversations in my head stopped but the lips never stopped moving. 

I just assumed it was some sort of trick of the mind and maybe everyone saw it but no one talked about it. Until last night.

I was alone, getting ready for bed as always when I heard a whispering sound. I figured it was the neighbors or something, thin walls, ya know? As I turned off the lights and laid down, I caught a glance of a poster hanging over my desk. I saw the lips move and the faintest whisper say ""Can you hear me?""."
ehghjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ehghjt/fly_swatter/,Fly Swatter,22,11,1577676996.0,"*THWAP*

It was the peak of summer, and the flys were everywhere. You open a window and seconds later you've got a bunch of the little buggers in your house. 

*THWAP* 

I let the fly swatter relax in my hand and admired my work. Fly guts were smeared and splattered all along the window, their bodies contorted in a vast spectacle of wings and carapaces. 

God, they just kept on coming! Somehow, their numbers continued escalating; I must've killed thousands over the last few weeks. I gingerly twirled the fly swatter. I'll be ready for 'em as they come. 

I sat down and looked at the window, gazing as the lush green of summer slowly faded into dusk. 

A small black shape landed on the glass directly in my line of sight. Another damn fly. At least this one wasn't in my house. Yet. I went up to the window and tapped, hoping to scare it away. 

It didn't move. 

It fluttered its wings, and, as if on cue, another insect landed on the window. And then another. 

Goddamn. I just knew that these would end up in my house at some point. Nothing I could do about it now, though. 

Yawning, I directed myself upstairs, ready to turn in for the night. As I was brushing my teeth, a fly landed on the mirror. With deliberation, almost delicately, I pulped it into oblivion with the flat of my hand. 

I sighed in irritation and washed my hands of its guts. 

I heard more buzzing as I was laying down, but was too tired to do anything about it. Slowly, I fell asleep. 

Only to wake up what felt like minutes later. The buzzing was all around me, a deafening chorus. There was a glittering dark fog in the room, a fog that was scintillating and twirling, constantly moving. I tried to brush it away with my hands and felt it give way, only to be replaced minutes later. Everything was dark. 

Suddenly, I couldn't breathe.

I felt shapes forcing their way into my mouth. I bit down and felt small bodies crushed by my teeth, felt guts and slime dribble down my chin. Soon, there were too many bugs in my mouth too bite down on. I couldn't breathe. 

They were pushing their way into my throat. I could feel the light hairs on their bodies tickling my insides. I gagged, tears streaming down my eyes. I couldn't breathe.

Insects were plugging up my nose. They were in my ears. I felt some squeezing their way under my eyelids. I couldn't breathe. 

Small bright stars flashed before my eyes despite the utter darkness created by the miasma of fluttered insects. I fell to my knees, then onto my side, sputtering and twitching. Flys crawled over every inch of my body. Weakly, I stretched out an arm. 

I... couldn't... breathe..."

The family that run the business was a Italian family of 5. One friend at my university told me that the menu was very cheap and delicious. He told me that they made the best spaghetti with meatball and bolognese sauce he ever has tried.   


One day, I decided to go and that's when I tried that spaghetti. Damn, it was good. Every day I would go there and order some spaghetti. Yes, i gained a little bit of weight, but the family was very nice enough that they even told me that I could go to the restaurant and not pay because it was nice having company. Various times I ordered to go, but after a day it started to smell bad, even refrigerated, which was weird, but I didn´t care, I could just eat it at the restaurant.

After going various times, I found one day that they closed because the father was arrested. It was a shame, because not only because of that, but because I lost a family.  


Recently, I found one of the members of the family, the daughter, on Facebook and we arranged a meeting where she would explain to me how to make that delicious spaghetti. The only weird thing that she told me was to bring a black plastic bag and a very sharp knife.

My boyfriend never snored before and it wasn’t a snore anyway. It was a wheeze really but bad enough so I didn’t get a wink of sleep most nights. Eventually, we agreed on what we laughingly called a ‘sleep divorce.’

I continued to sleep in our bedroom and Ed (that’s my boyfriend), he started taking the guest room.

The solution should have been total. But I could still hear the wheezing through the wall.

\*\*\*

Sleeping away from someone you love on a regular basis is really unsustainable though.

On weekends and holidays we let the whole thing slide and slept together. The noise he made was still annoying but if I had nowhere to be the next morning I could deal with it.

\*\*\*

After living this way for more than a year Ed’s breathing problem started to get better. We just reckoned he’d lost some weight or that his switching to decaf had done the trick.

Ed stopped sleeping in the guest room and our sex life got a little bit crazy after that. I *still* wasn’t getting much sleep but circumstances matter and this was a *way* better reason for insomnia.

\*\*\*

One night, after making love, I fell asleep with my head on Ed’s neck.

The wheezing started again.

I was so comfortable I didn’t want to move. I just lay there listening to the annoying sound.

I was just about to sit up and make Ed go to the guest room again when I got the sharpest pain in the side of my face, exactly where my skin made contact with his.

I shot up, yelled and grabbed at my face. I was bleeding.

Despite my having screamed, Ed hadn’t moved. He was still laying out flat and that weird wheezing noise was still issuing from his throat.

I never even took the time to work out why Ed was so unresponsive. I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

My face in the mirror was all dotted with perfectly round perforations. They were still painful to the touch at first but the more I ran my fingers over them the better they felt and then the weirdest sensation came over me: The holes in my face felt *good*. Better than good. It was like every spot where my skin had been broken was a sexual organ and every sexual organ was going into overdrive with orgasm after orgasm.

I laughed at my reflection in the mirror.

I ran back to our bedroom to tell Ed. He still hadn’t sat up. He was still laying there: wheezing, unconscious.

Then I saw the things protruding from his neck, the same things that had punctured my face and sent my skin spiralling into the euphoric state I couldn’t shake even now.

I laughed.

The tendrils in Ed’s neck quivered and whined. They were calling me back to bed.

I went."

The technology where I’m from lets me leap through time.

Like a routine morning, such is the speed and spontaneity with which I wake up to a new setting. This one a cold December afternoon. The middle of a forest.

Then I see it: a red pick-up parked twenty feet away.

I pulled the pistol out of my pocket. Lunged toward the window on the driver’s side. 

A chubby nine-year-old boy sat in the passenger’s seat. A backpack at his feet. His face beyond nervous.

Behind the wheel, a tall man leaned back. He was even chubbier. His smile growing wider as he unbuckled his khakis. 

Using the pistol, I tapped on the window. Startled the two.

In a burst, the kid snatched his backpack and ran into the forest.

The man struggled to slide his pants back on.

I pointed the pistol down.

His perverse pleasure fading, the man lowered the window. “Is something the matter?” he asked in a raspy Chicago accent.

“Yeah,” I responded. I put the gun to his head. “You.”

I pulled the trigger. The top of his head exploded. Like confetti, blood and gray matter scattered everywhere.

The man fell back. His body forever preserved in its sickening final few moments.

I walked toward the woods. Saw the boy in a clearing. 

Crying, the kid faced me.

""It’s okay!” Putting the pistol in my pocket, I leaned down. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“What are you gonna do?” the boy said.

I placed my hands on his shoulders. “I’m just here to help.”

“I'm sorry...” the boy said.

Uneasy, I saw what lurked behind him.

I saw the backpack next to a couple of charred turkeys. Each of them burnt alive. Their eyes bulging. Their dead tongues hanging out for a final gasp at life.

The weapons were unusual but effective: balloons. Each filled with gasoline.

“I just couldn’t help it, mister,” the kid said, his voice simultaneously innocent and tormented.

My horrified gaze drifted to a box of matches. Five of them freshly struck.

“I had to do something,” the kid continued.

Weeping, I faced him. “I know, John.”

His eyes grew bigger. “How'd you know my name?”

I gripped his shoulder as I stood up. “Just come with me.”

I led us past the turkeys. Past one of John's first crime scenes. 

In the forest, I didn’t bother holding back tears. Didn’t suppress my shivers as I reached into my pocket. For the gun.

1951 never felt colder. I couldn’t blame the snow since there wasn’t any in Chicago that day. Only the chilling company I made. The looming execution of John Wayne Gacy. A portrait of a serial killer at a young age I had to erase.

The ages were the hardest part about the missions. Not executing evil. But having to do so before they reached their peak. When they were just children."

It might be said:

Upon an altar, on his knees, with his hands clasped and head tucked into his navel, a priest rocks rhythmically. Although, I can't hear him, I'm certain he's praying, because his whole life has conditioned him to cope in no other way but that. I pity him; He is surrounded by his brethren's body parts, and ensured to enjoy the same fate. 

His tormentors encircle him, as their matriarch, perched on a make-shift throne, spectates at a distance. Though she has yet to participate in the festivities, all know that he is hers and dare not approach him. 

Despite the atmosphere, she is not amused, and both her patience and her time are wearing thin. She rises and moves toward him. As she approaches, the crowd parts, opening a pathway. Once she is close enough to him, she stoops by his side. The smell of garlic wafting from his pores, doubtlessly a necessary precaution on his part, undoes some of her formality.

She leans toward him, places her hand on his shoulder, and whispers in his ear. For a moment, he indulges doubt, but, repudiated by his lapse in faith, he rejects his uncertainty and cries out,  ""Forgive me father"". She howls to him, ""I thought you knew? There is no mercy child. Now tell me where she is. '' A long silence follows. Her patience can't be contained anymore; she sinks her fangs into his neck, disregarding the danger his garlic infused blood poses to her already dwindling life-force, and arrives at the answers she sought; the prophecy was a charade to facilitate this moment. With his dying breath the priest triggers a UV bomb.

The last of the footage is pitch black, the image sensor was mostly likely damaged by the bomb. So, I stop the footage, remove the SD card containing it, plug it in my device, and upload it to the global repository. We assumed the priest failed his mission, but it turns out that the queen of this hive didn't escape. The priest's sacrifice wasn't in vain.

The world's end coincided with vampirism's return, and unsurprisingly, both were brought to you by science. Hilariously, people thought it be AI that'd wipe us out. Ironically, it's what's been keeping us alive.

Unfortunately, I  won't get to see humanity's triumphant return though; I'm nearly out of ammo. I clutch the pendent hanging from my neck and open it. Inside it are pictures of my wife and son; they didn't survive the outbreak. My eyes swell with pain as memories of them trickle down my face. Then I inhale deeply; I'm ready.

The room floods with vamps. They defy gravity, crawling on the walls and the ceiling. I'm surrounded, now, but  I'll be damned if I let them have me. I take one last look at what those **BASTARDS** snatched from me, turn my gun to my chest and pull the trigger, but the firing pin only clicks."

eh9lqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/eh9lqw/perfection/,Perfection,21,7,1577644990.0,"

	She was perfect and exactly what I needed. Her black hair cascaded down her back in long thick waves and her golden eyes bore straight into mine. It definitely helped that her parents had left town for the weekend because now I had my chance and I am going to take it. 

	The planing of this exact day has been in the works for 16 long years and even more if you consider the time it took to find such perfection. 

	Perfection has a way of hiding in the depths of this chaotic world sometimes its right under your nose and because of your inability to recognize you’ll never find it. But I have had many many years and in that time I’ve come across many creatures that appeared perfect only to eventually find the rot within. But this one is different I can tell. 

	The small crack in the mirror never seemed to bother her but today was different. For some unknown reason it was all she could think about. I watched her perfect limbs glide back and forth around the small room only to eventually find herself back at the dingy mirror picking at the growing crack. 

	At first she didn’t notice the black liquid that began to drip out of the mirror but when she did it only made her curiosity grow and thus she continued to pick at the mirror till her fingers bled and her iron filled blood intermingled with the inky black substance.

	Her slow pacing soon turned to a dance of some sort as she marveled the black liquid. She couldn’t figure out what it was but for some reason it fascinated her to her very core. She wanted more so she ran to the mirror and continued picking until the liquid poured out and the glass shattered slicing her pale skin. It didn’t bother her because the cold black substance made her feel whole. A feeling she had never known before.
	
	As the liquid slowly seeped into the cuts along her skin she felt so exhausted to tired to move so she sat among the shattered glass and strange liquid. She rested her head on the tiled wall as her eyes fluttered closed. 

	I finally had her now and I wasn’t going to let her go. While she slept I took my chance! I leaked into the cuts littering her body pushing her blood out onto the floor so I could take its place. Once I was in I flowed through her body making it mine. Like I said... she was perfection. I just had to have it!

	I woke on the bathroom floor and looked up to see the mirror with the tiniest of cracks. Today I filled it. There is no way I’m giving her back! 


	I’m hidden in plain sight yet you would never suspect me 

	I see your every move and I’ve learned to copy 

	What am I you ask while staring at the zit in the middle of your forehead 

	I’m your reflection, your doppelgänger, your worst nightmare and I want out!

	I want your life,
	I want your stuff,
	I want your job,

	But most importantly I want you.

	So I’ll wait until ya least expect it and ill get ya!

	And then you’ll be wanting out."

The street was quiet, only noise being my growling stomach. Father is going to be furious, I missed lunch and was late for dinner.

I thought about all the times he mistreated me, forbidden me my childhood.

My dark thoughts got interrupted:

""Hey kid, what's the hurry little man.

I froze, my mind racing, what should I do?

A tall man approached me, followed by two.

""Do you have any spare change little man?""
The left thug said, while the right one was rummaging my pockets.

""Empty""

""We can't have you crossing this street without any contributions, now can we?""

""Or do you think he's old enough for a beating""

Shifting from left to right like they rehearsed this, the tall man staring me down.

""Father has money"" I said without thinking.

""Well where is your hospitality, invite us over""

As the doorbell rang adrenalin rushed, outside was freezing but my blood was searing hot.
The door opened slowly, fathers face unchanged by what was in front of him, he was always a cold calculated bastard.

""We're here for a donation"" said the smallest thug grinning, while his lowlife friend pushed me. The door closed, everyone exchanged glances.

""Give us your valuables and everyone can have a good evening""

After a pause father finally spoke ""No""

The tall man took a deep sigh, shifting his jacket revealing a gun.

""Trust me when I say you won't carry your valuables to the grave""

Agitated by no reaction he pulled his gun

""You think we are joking"" waiving the gun in my face ""Give us your money or say goodbye to the kid""

The two thugs surrounded me, I tried to make a noise but each time the air was kicked out of my lungs.

""So what's it gonna be old man""

""I guess his time has come""

I couldn't believe what he said, before I had time to react three loud bangs echoed. My boiling blood drenched the carpet, they turned on father.

My ears were buzzing from loud gunshots, the thugs didn't hear me get up, they didn't hear muffled gasps of pain as my nails grew, my skin tore, my fangs forming a perfect bite.

Everything was red, even before I took the first thugs head clean off. The tall man was barely up to my shoulders now, his slow reaction to turn his gun was interrupted by dismemberment.

His blood tasted of fear.

The smallest thug fell, eyes wide in horror, mouth babbling nonsense. I tried to hold back, I really did, but the bloody rags hanging from my claws could not be classified as human anymore.

I looked into fathers dark yellow eyes:

""Thank you for letting me hunt today""

I had pictured it a million times. 

I had longed for this. 

I was alone this weekend. But really I was alone all the time. 

I ran a bath. 

I made myself a vodka on the rocks. 

I drank it, fast. 

I undressed, slow. 

The water was hot. Just how I like it. 

The knife against my skin. 

The blood looked like syrup. 

My vision got darker. 

I would finally be free.

I would finally be free. 

My vision was black. 

But the pain in my wrists remained. 

The bath was getting colder. 

Why was I still here? 

The bath was getting colder.

Why is she still screaming?

I figured it would be okay - sure, I didn’t know all of the friends of friends of friends that were there, but I wasn’t about to kick them out into the snow. 

The TV was on, showing one of those programs that watches all the different performers and stuff in Times Square and around the country. Too many people were drunk. 

My next thought was something along the lines of “hey, it’s *really* dark outside.”

Sure, it was nearly midnight. But shouldn’t the moon be reflecting off the snow? Shouldn’t there be a glow behind the clouds in the sky? 

Turning away from the window, I heard the countdown start. 

Ten... nine... eight...

Damn, it’s *really* dark outside. 

Three... two... one!

As people started kissing each other and screaming “Happy New Year!”, every light went out. 

Everything went dead black. 

I fumbled along the walls in the dark, trying to make my way outside. Nobody’s phone was working; nobody could find a flashlight. 

I finally fell into the snow outside my door, and looked up at where I thought the sky should be. 

There was no doubting it. 

The moon was gone."

The following transcript has been salvaged from the ruins of a failed government facility in Arizona. Minimal corruption has occurred.

———————————————————————

1. Before entering the tunnel, remove all religious and personal items and place them in the Safehouse

2. Once inside the tunnel, DO NOT speak unless spoken to, and especially don’t mention the smell

3. If you see a humanoid figure standing in the tunnel before entry, **DO NOT** avert your gaze and leave the entrance chamber, sealing the door once outside

4. Once inside the tunnel, **DO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU** no matter what you see, hear, smell, or feel

5. Relating to rule 4: Once inside the tunnel, you may feel an intense fear of the dark, claustrophobia, or the sensation of being watched, but again, **DO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU.** Keep your head fixed either forward or down at all times

6. The tunnel *will* seem longer and darker than expected, but do not panic. You will always find the exit if you follow these rules

7. A few hours inside the tunnel may cause a slight mental breakdown. This is dangerous and should be dealt with by keeping your eyes shut and applying pressure to your ears

8. If you see any light whatsoever inside the tunnel (other than the exit/entry chamber), lay on the ground, face to the floor, with your hood pulled over you until you hear the screaming fade

9. Inside the tunnel you may (rarely) hear crying behind of you. If this occurs, **run without looking back**

10. If you feel you’re being watched from above, **repeat the phrase “caeca tenebris” until the feeling fades.** You should know the pronunciation from your training

11. **If the feeling does not fade, turn on your flashlight and point it behind you.** It will go faster

12. If you meet any person(s) in the tunnel, answer *any* questions they have with “I’m not sure”. They will undoubtedly tell you their name, which will always be that of a friend, family member, or respected official. Once done introducing themselves, they will begin to resemble that person. **DO NOT TRUST THEM.** They will pretend to lead you to the exit, but what they won’t mention is that the exit they take you to is not that of the tunnel

13. Remember, if you see the exit, **always** call out to it before exiting. There will always be personnel in the exit chamber, and if there is no response, or if it is muffled and/or incomprehensible, call again. If you have called three times with no response, **repeat “ostende veritatis” until the mirage fades**, you should only need to say it once 

14. Upon reaching the exit, always mark off your name by circling it with the provided dagger

15. Once outside of the tunnel, after circling your name, evacuate the Exit Chamber and climb the stairs onto the Desert Level

16. **NEVER LOOK** *[File corruption]*"

She didn’t believe me when I told her that I hear her outside my room every night, just talking.  She insisted that she’s *never* been a sleepwalker.

I wanted to prove to her that she was doing this, so I bought a cheap security camera and installed it over my door, pointed directly down where she would be standing.  That night, I went to sleep eager to wake up the next morning and show her my proof.  It was a petty squabble, but I was determined to be right.  

Sure enough, that night around 3:30, I woke to the sound of my roommate carrying on a conversation with herself, laughing at her own words.  I had left the light on in the hallway just outside my room, and could see the outline of her feet in the crack between the floor and the bottom of the door. 

I couldn’t hear everything she said, but I thought it would be interesting to listen back in the morning.  I thought about getting up and opening the door to wake her, as that would be pretty good proof in and of itself, but my bed was comfy, and I had the video anyway.  I chuckled a little, feeling vindicated that I now had my proof, then went back to sleep.  

First thing when I got up the next morning, I opened my laptop and pulled up the feed from the night before.  I sat, puzzled.  The camera didn’t catch...anything.  

She never came to my door.

And the only indication that I hadn’t been dreaming the entire situation, is that right at the 3:30 mark, laughter can clearly be heard."

I can’t remember the last time I saw the sunlight. It was a distant memory but a pleasant one. It was one of the few that remained and I held onto it with all of my remaining will. Memories were really all I had left. Nona wouldn’t allow me to have anything else.
 
Nona’s rough scales and bristly hair rubbed my skin raw, her grip was powerful and she held me tight. Occasionally I felt her hot rancid breath in my face, it smelled of centuries old death and decay.  I used my right arm to awkwardly wipe her drool and spittle off of my face. My right arm was all I had, my left arm was pinned so tightly against Nona that I couldn’t feel it anymore. And my legs had been shattered and broken so many times that they just dangled lifelessly under me. I would have died from starvation long ago but Nona wouldn’t have that, she forced me against her teat. She forced me to swallow her foul milk so that she could keep me alive.
 
I could only feel shame and disgust as my own waste slid down my emaciated and useless legs. Nona would make strange mewling sounds and then use her long, warty  tongue to clean the waste off of me. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t, if I did Nona would panic and squeeze me until I blacked out. Last time that happened she had completely broken my wrist, it healed back but now my hand was permanently at a weird angle.
 
Nona’s brain was dead and rotted, she was completely insane. She had eaten every last one of her newly hatched children from her last true brood. She stomped upon their small bodies and ate them one by one. I was now her replacement “son”. Sometimes she would lay a batch of unfertilized eggs. After a few weeks they would start to rot and stink. She would go into a fit of rage when her fetid mind realized that they weren’t going to hatch. These moments were truly terrifying yet I hoped and prayed to every god I could think of that she would slip up in her rage and kill me. But she didn’t. She would break my bones and peel my skin off but after her fit she would start to nurse me back.
 
Today we were visited by another of her kind, a large male. He looked at me in disgust. I can only imagine what my broken human form looks like at this point, especially to one of them. I asked him to kill me. He ignored me and tossed some form of slop with rotten meat bits  down into our pit for Nona to consume. I silently cried as I watched him leave, because, now I was alone with Nona again. And my own broken thoughts."

I take a sip, studying them, they do look like they’ve been missing too much sleep, dark bags under the eyes, washed out complexions.

“Ok… Ok! I’ll handle it!” my tone sharp. 

Some things really aggravate me, especially before my coffee. 

Getting told what to do, and their sensitivity to these “visitors” are the top two and three this morning. Lack of work in this economy and giving gifts despite going bankrupt being the first.

This house has been in my family for generations, nobody had a problem here until we moved in. 

Periodically we get “visitors”. Ghostly forms floating through the house, moving things or talking loudly. She suggested we move, but I won’t be the one in the family that lost the homestead.

These visions go away if you simply yell or throw a book at them. They seem to be getting worse as Christmas draws near.

…

I sit at the dining room table, dozing off as I listen to see if they’ll visit tonight. 

I open my eyes to a lit room. I fear I may have slept till morning but quickly realize the light is coming from a candle on the table.

Through the candlelight I can start to make out multiple apparitions. I stand quickly realizing I was sitting right inside one of them. 

“Get out of my house!” I yell, my anger genuine from the lack of sleep.  

Several of them flinch, but they don’t vanish. They are fuzzy, but they appear to be praying. 

The one at the head of the table appears to come in more clearly. 

“Mr. Clark can you hear me?” It startles me as they’ve never spoke before. 

“Get out of my house! Leave us alone!” I scream into her ear. Her head finches, but she doesn’t vanish.

“Mr. Clark what is your reason for being here?” She asks. 

“I live here! This is my house! Get out of my house! Leave my family alone!” I scream, throwing a book across the room.

“Mr. Clark why did you murder your family on Christmas of 1931?” she asks. 

I need a more powerful statement... An idea pops into my head.

I scream “Get out of my house or I’ll kill you all!” taking a mouthful of lamp oil I spit it into the candles causing a burst in the flames.

She had been clever, referring to tomorrow in the past tense, trying to spook me. That fireball was too much for them, they’re gone for good now.

I ponder “If ghosts are real, there’s an afterlife. Maybe they had a good idea, killing all of us, I’m sure we can get some damn sleep as ghosts.”

I start the plan a gift for my family; a way out of this hell, this great depression."
egqufn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/egqufn/stairs/,Stairs,1199,29,1577540373.0,"Despite having turned 15 just a few short weeks ago, Abigail was still bothered by being left alone in the house. You’d think most teenagers would consider it their own little bubble of bliss; no parents, no rules. As long as no crazy parties were held and dad’s sacred beer stash remained untouched, there was nothing you couldn’t reasonably do.

Abigail, however, was too nervous to try much at all, and so she remained in one place most times her parents went out. Typically in her bedroom, where safety felt the strongest, but sometimes downstairs so she could cosy up on the couch and watch a good little comedy. 

“No monsters, right?”

She asked herself that and, embarrassingly, she had doubts. The girl was 15 now and yet she feared such things existing. It wasn’t necessarily their appearance, nor their wanting to hurt her or worse, but rather the way they gave chase. She imagined they would be faster than any other natural being in the world, and when they were in the middle of a hunt, nothing else mattered. All of their energy would be projected unto catching and destroying their prey.

And so, Abigail feared stairs. That familiar rush people get when they ascend a flight of stairs in the dead of night… that rush, I say, was magnified in Abigail to the point of being actual fear.

She had just finished a recording of her favourite show when the inevitable came to her mind; she was tired, and her bedroom was upstairs. Now came the time for her to face her demons and to climb those damned stairs. She could never fall asleep on the couch for too long, and would always wake up poorly-rested anyhow.

The moment she stood up, Abigail’s mind jumped into gear, as she had expected. Her imagination was crazy, and nothing quite stimulated it like the darkness.

Not only her eyes, but also her ears were playing games. Her own body conspired against her to throw the poor girl into a state of panic, refusing to let up until she got up those stairs and into the security of her well-lit bedroom.

She took her final steps out of the darkened living room and was met by the staircase dominating the hallway in wait for her presence. Abigail had no time to waste. This monster was running through the dark, the noises of that old home were instead its quietened growls and its frantic footsteps.

Abigail ran, harnessing her fear to speed up those stairs with all her strength.

Then, as always happened, by the time she was approaching the top, she felt that horrible rush be quashed by a feeling of relief, and of silliness. She knew there were no monsters. Her own senses had betrayed her, as they would surely do again. Perhaps next time she would be better prepared, she told herself.

She certainly, however, wasn’t prepared for the unfamiliar man stood waiting at the top."

I work all week, but don’t even earn enough to enjoy a night out. I suffer from OCD and it’s amplified by stress. I try to relax myself by reading, watching tv or listening to music. But my mind always seems to drift and the hounding thoughts trigger an OCD episode. After a tough day of work I sometimes clean my already spotless apartment from top to bottom. I clean throughout the night and don’t even make time for sleep before work. 

I know living like this isn’t healthy, so I decided to try something new to distract my mind and put me at ease. I was going to start listening to scary stories on YouTube. The mystery and suspense are perfect for maintaining my concentration and allowing my mind an escape from the stresses of the day. 

My new tactic was seemingly a huge success. A few days in with no impulses to clean, no thoughts of despair, nothing but stories and sleep. The tone of the narrator put me at ease, the stories were mysterious enough to keep me guessing, scary enough to keep me interested and at the conclusion I always felt calm enough to drift off to bed. It was still a boring life, but a peaceful life and for the first time in awhile I was content. 

I arrived home from work, ate dinner, showered and slid my earbuds in for my daily dose. I began listening to the voice of the narrator, but tonight I wasn’t getting the same feeling I have the previous nights. I was feeling a sense of unease. I tried concentrating on the soothing voice, tried comprehending the story being laid out in front of me, but my mind was beginning to race.

I felt physically cold and I began letting the OCD tendencies creep in. I thought of how I hadn’t cleaned the house in days, how I hadn’t changed the sheets or taken out the garbage. Now it was ringing in my head on repeat, I gave into my impulses. I had to get new sheets out of the dryer. I had to take the garbage out. I had to close the window. I had to water the plants.

Suddenly my mind stopped racing and only one thought went through my mind: I never opened the window."

He sees the flashes of bright color through his closed eyelids; first red, now green, now purple. The music is so loud he wants to plug his ears. His head is pounding, but he feels someone shaking his shoulders so he slowly opens his eyes. 

A man no older than 24 despite the scraggly, unkempt beard is looking at him worriedly. 

""Shit, man, you had us worried for a sec,"" he says. 

Greg sits up and looks around. The room is full of people; a few guys are holding beers, theres a few people fucking with wild abandon in the corner, others are passing around a joint, some are puking up their guts. 

""I'm at a party?"" Greg asks. ""How'd I get here?"" He puts a hand to his pounding head. Shit. He couldn't remember, but that's always a sign of a good party. 

The bearded man helps him to his feet. ""Nobody really knows how we get here, but none of us are complaining. You see, this party never ends, bro."" 

He extends his hand to Greg. The nails are long and crusted in dirt. ""My names Josh. I've been here the longest. 6 years and counting!"" He nods to a corner of the room where a few others are huddled. They all look haggard and unkempt,  like they dont belong. ""Henry's been here 3 years, Ted's been here for 2 and half. And now there's you!"" Josh hesitates for a second. ""And everyone else,"" he adds.

Josh pauses as a beer bottles sails by Greg's head and smashes into the wall. As Greg turns to see who threw it, a girl walks by and pulls him towards her face, lips parted. Surprised but definitely not complaining, Greg leans in. Then she starts to fade away. Bewildered, Greg looks around. The music stopped. The lights have disappeared. The broken beer bottle is no longer there. The walls now look brown and worn and are covered in feces and urine. There's nobody in the small room except Josh, Henry, and Ted, who stand huddled underneath a small panel in the ceiling. 

""What the actual FUCK!?"" Greg exclaims. He walks towards Josh, who's watching the panel intently. ""Wanna tell me what's going on here?""

Then he pauses at a sound from the ceiling. The small panel opens up and a multitude of small plastic bags fall through. Greg watches as the three men pounce on the small packets, tearing them open and devouring them. 

Josh tosses one of the little bags to Greg. Greg looks down at the white powder and assortment of pills within it. He looks at the others, disheveled and dirty, then back at the pouch. 

He understands. 

Greg rips open the bag and downs the contents. The music and lights slowly return. The girl materializes in his arms. He feels calm and relaxed.

Josh looks at him again. ""Welcome to the party that never ends,"" he says."

Just one day when you're in the shower, using your usual loofah, but it just feels different, you can't explain it, but it feels... off.   
No sweat, probably all in your head. Right?  
Right.

Small things go missing, you could swear to God you just bought milk, how is the carton completely gone? You live alone.. There's no way anyone was in here and stole it. Right?  
Right. 

Another day you're driving home.. That road has never been there off of this main road. You swear you're not crazy, but how are there so many houses with cars in the driveway? How are these houses all lived in and maintained? This road has not once been here in the last 6 years you've taken this route. Maybe you're so used to the mundane tasks, you zone out while driving and you've just never noticed it. That has to be it. Right? Right.  
Right?

Things start making less and less sense. You swear on anything these tiny changes are occurring, but it seems like no one else can see them. The changes you mention to your friends only leave you with concerned glances and hushed words they're sure to cut off before you walk into a room. No one seems to believe you, maybe this is all in your head? Right? Right.. But you just cannot accept that. This isn't in your head and it's not your fault no one else can see it. 

Small things turn to big things. You know you didn't drive that Honda out front, however, your chariot awaits. Your dark brown hair is now a brassy blonde. Brown eyes don't change, but there they are staring at you, a speckled green. Why is it that no one else can see this? Why does everyone make you feel like you're crazy? Telling people about these changes has become even more terrifying than the changes themselves.

The looks in doctors eyes mirror the concern your friends hold, yet they show something else. Is that fear? You cannot keep this up anymore, you swallow their pills you beg for relief. Please make it stop. This will have to work, right?

Eventually, it's maybe worth admitting you are crazy. Staying in a hospital in a plain white room with no mirrors provides stability. Perhaps your friends and the doctors were right... Right?

07:50- I put my gun to my head. It doesn’t fire.

08:00- I try to drown myself in the bathtub, in my room. I can breath normally, even with my full body under

08:20- I beg to be let out. I don’t think they grasp the concept.

08:30- I try to jump from the ship- I end up back on it. They grab me. I beg. I’d rather die then be in this loop. They shake their head. “You say that every time. A misunderstanding. When we know you well enough, you will understand. Reset”.

I stared out the window, trying to ignore them. That's when I saw the other truck. The driver and passenger looked terrified. They tried to stop but the truck was going to fast.

They slammed into us, crushing the front passenger door and sending glass everywhere. I heard the sickening crack of the door hitting my mother's head.

We rolled down the mountain, glass shattering everywhere around us. My mother and her boyfriend were thrown out the front window, they never wore seatbelts. A rock hit my glasses and shattered them, sending plastic into my eyes. I screamed in sheer pain, my ears pounding from the sound of metal tearing around me.

I remember hearing a loud bang and feeling the truck stop. I remember feeling blood roll down my cheeks from my eyes. I remember the pain I felt. I remember passing out.

I woke up hearing beeping all around me. The room was pitch black. I weakly moved my hand around until I hit the end table. I somehow found a lamp and pulled the chain. It did nothing.

in, wouldn’t it be gone ? Maybe there’s another entrance I don’t know about. I walked in, the floor was really creaky and it was super dark. Using my phone flashlight, I made my way up a staircase. 

*ding!*

It was a text. From Mike.
“Ay man sorry I made a typo. Its 176 Lambourne Crescent” 

I heard the front door slam shut from the floor below me, an evil cackle echoed throughout the house."

Vampires will never ever enter your home unless invited. They aren't bound by some magical barrier, they're just unerringly polite.


Vampires are meticulous, precise and ever organised. They feel a need to record, for reference. They'll tally every catch.


If a fistful of dry rice is thrown on the ground, a vampire will stop to count every grain. If distracted, they'll start again from scratch.


Vampires love of symmetry, akin to O.C.D., fuels a burning itch to couple words, to double words, to rhyme.


It's true that vampires shun the sunlight, though this is because they detest the chaos of crowds. their skin won't singe in daytime.


The vampire, like the puppy, likes to test the strength of its teeth by gnawing, and it's claws by clawing. It is like the puppy in no other way.


A vampire cannot cross running water, unless there is a bridge. That is as close to a joke as a vampire will stray.


Look not for cliche when ascertaining the vampire. They'd never blend into the modern city in dinner-suit or cape.


Vampires adore any lore about their kind. It doesn't matter if it's accurate; all the better if it's fake."

B

“He was always quiet, so even saying I “knew” him as a child would be a lie really. I don’t think any of us really “knew” him in that way, he was just an acquaintance even at that age. I think that’s pretty normal though, for kids to want to keep to themselves nowadays. I think people just left him alone, which appeared to suit him fine.”

C

“He was close to me, yes. I thought so, anyway. Felt so, certainly. Now, having heard what people are saying, I’m not so sure. There were a lot of lies.”

D

“I was there that night, yes. I know, not many survived it.”

E

“I think he picked up his interest in magic early on. I mean, it was difficult to know, but with the obvious talent he had I always presumed he must have started early. Like a child prodigy on the piano or something. Of course, he probably would have kept that to himself, but yeah I think he must have started early.”

F

“He did gradually grow more distant. It was not something I immediately noticed, more of a hindsight thing. I wasn’t really sure what to make of it when I did realise it. It seemed a bizarre notion that he might be seeing someone else, but as soon as an idea latches on it has a habit of sticking around. I mean, I guess we all know now probably what that was all about. A part of me does still hope that it’s all some illusion somehow. I mean, people have died, it can’t be. But what else can I think, how am I supposed to retain some shred of sanity otherwise?”

G

“The official story was that it was some kind of spontaneous thing, like he wasn’t actually involved. They say it must have been a coincidence. But these people weren’t there, they didn’t see it. I saw it, and I can tell you, it was more than that. What I saw, I can’t explain it. I’m pretty sure the only reason I’m still alive is I didn’t see the end of the thing.”

H

“I think, perhaps he’d hit on something. Some grand illusion. And perhaps he thought he had mastery over it, at least for a while. I mean, this isn’t the only unexplained thing that’s ever happened; maybe he’s not the first. The only difference is this time, he pushed it a bit too far, and now we are all paying the price. That’s what I think anyway.”

After the news stories and the GoFundMe’s, there was no shortage of people willing to help out, to come up with special accommodations for this sudden and terrible deformity. 

What happened was my friend and I were getting ready to go out and meet up with some friends. We were procrastinating and messing around at her apartment, smoking a bowl and having a couple glasses of wine. She opened up the SnapChat app and headed off to the kitchen to refill her wine.  

""Hey! Take a selfie with me! It's for Greg.""

""Nah, I'm good,"" I said from the couch. It’s not that I minded doing it for her, but I was relaxed and didn’t want to get up. I've never been more thankful for my own laziness in my life. 

From the kitchen, I heard a scream intermingled with an awful crunching noise.

“Elise? What is it?” I asked, getting up from the couch. 

She came around the corner, a look of horror on her face. What I saw knocked the wind out of me.

Her eyes were...giant. The whites of them the size of saucers, every blood vessel prominent and huge. They invaded the territory of her forehead and her eyelashes were long tendrils that flopped around involuntarily. She looked like some CGI Disney princess come to life, eyes all stylized and unrealistic, but very real as she stood before me. 

No one could come up with a plausible explanation that didn't involve black magic or the supernatural. It was a medical and scientific mystery. For others, it was simply proof that we were living in a simulation. Us, the subjects of the simulation had somehow created software that could alter the matrix's code in real time, resulting in the monstrosities we now witnessed. 

The app's stock plummeted and they removed all filter options from their programming, their most popular feature. In Washington they worked diligently to shut down the app completely. 

But not before there were other victims: the kid with a gaping red lipped mouth where his face used to be, teeth the size of credit cards. Or the Instagram influencer who had developed the soft brown nose of a deer and bony antlers jutting from her forehead. She was more fortunate and made a few videos for the furry crowd before having surgical correction. Then there was the girl who vomited a torrent of bright rainbow colors everytime she opened her mouth.They had wired her jaw shut for the time being and were coming up with a solution that involved abdominal surgery and a feeding tube. 

My friend’s eyes hurt constantly and she has to use special drops for lubrication. They say she may go blind. Snapchat was retooled and the CEO was eventually fired. He walked away with a 35.7 million severance package."

“Jimmy, you doin okay man? What’s going on?” Bill could now see a large cross that Jimmy had carved in his own chest. He kicked himself for thinking a wilderness camping trip would help distract Jimmy from his wife’s death.

“Jesus Jimmy! What did you do?”

Jimmy squatted, studying Bill, occasionally looking to the sky, it was almost completely dark now.

“I’m just workin on a theory.” Jimmy said with tears in his eyes. “I just want to make sure you’re given the chance to make amends in case I have to do what I’m thinkin I might.”

“Jimmy, you’re freaking me out... What is it that you think you might have to do? Did you take your medication? You’re not lookin so hot…”

Jimmy looked at his watch then to the sky. He pulled a flask from his pocket and took a long pull. “I’ve got my medicine right here…” removing a large revolver from his waistband “Like I said… I’m workin on a theory.”

Bill increased his covert efforts to escape the chains. “Jimmy what’s the gun for? What do you think you might have to do?”

“Do you remember the night?” Jimmy stifling back tears… “last month, the night Emily was killed?”

“Jimmy, we talked about this… we was together… we drank all that shine… got so blitzed that we can’t remember crap… “

“Yeah… I remember… That’s why this is so hard…” Jimmy trying again to regain his voice through the emotions. “You’re the only one I can’t account for that night… Only one theory makes sense.”

“Is that what this was about? You think I tore her apart like that? She was like my sister!” Bill was now pulling against the chains, trying to stand or loosen them.

Jimmy removed a single bullet from the cylinder. “Nine bucks a shot… Normally” He looked at the bullet studying it, his appearance pale and sweaty. “Made this one from her necklace… pure silver…” looking to the sky “Moon should be up soon”

“Jimmy… where’s your meds? Jesus, let me go, I can get em for you… Are you sayn you think I’m a werewolf?”

Jimmy stood, taking another swig from the flask, sweating profusely now. “You better get right with Jesus; cause I’m sending you to meet him…” cocking the hammer as he points the gun at Bill’s heart.

“Jimmy! Jesus… Let me get your meds!” Bill struggled against the bindings. “Jimmy, listen if I’m going to change doesn’t the moonlight have to hit me?”

Jimmy was now ghostly white, scratching his skin on his chest, a wild look in his eyes.

“Please Jimmy…”

Everyone was pretty loud and excited after coming back from break, so it was hard to notice the awkward movements and twitching coming from the substitute teacher.

Anyway, I was busy scribbling in my notebook when the sub passed out the assigned numbers for each student. This was somewhat standard for school but I was surprised at how quickly the class got quiet. I looked down at my number and saw a glistening 13.

This made me more curious and I started to gaze around the class to see what everyone else got. My desk partner had sixty-eight. The girl to my left had three hundred sixty-six. And further down a boy had one thousand. This was especially confusing since we only had 25 students in attendance. What was even eerier was those with a negative slashed behind theirs. 

The atmosphere felt increasingly tense and I felt a heavy weight in my stomach. Usually, we would be laughing and poking fun at the absurdness of these assigned numbers, but even the class clown held his tongue. As I looked at everyone's numbers I began to realize that everyone was looking in the same direction. I followed their stares back to the sub. He was slouching back awkwardly against his chair. He didn't even hold his own head up so he looked more like a life-size puppet than a human. Or like a ragdoll with no soul. His eyes looked so dark I could have sworn they weren't even there. 

I couldn't stand to look at him anymore. I pulled down my wool cap as my far as I could and stared straight down at my desk. On one hand, I chewed my fingernail and on the other, I shakily wrote broken cursive, quickly and quietly in my notebook. Around me, I could hear screams and the unnatural sounds of bones crunching and twisting. I wrote faster trying to drown out the sounds. I splintered my pencil but kept writing. I felt myself shrinking further into my seat. My nail was chewed bloody. 

Then, silence.

Looking down, I led myself out of the classroom. I ignored all the wrinkled and skeleton-like things I saw piled all around the room in the corner of my eye. Some of them were incredibly small. Even when I was out of school and could feel the sun on face, I didn't look up. I felt my way home and went directly to my room. It was then that I noticed it. I collapsed in shock at what I saw in my reflection. I was a few inches shorter, my skin was fair and smooth, and my arms were very slender. I was no longer 17 years old."

Of course there were about 5 ghosts within the same room as us. My sister and I got scared because we were young and fell for that stuff. My dad laughed and told us it was a joke and put his phone down. Seconds after that the hallway closet door slowly opened on it's own. My dad was just as surprised as we were. He tried to play it off as there were just too many coats in there and it pushed the door open, but I know there was something else in the house with us and it wanted us to know it was there."

There is no mistaking it, the sound or its disconcerting location. My heartbeat spikes and my mind races. Every muscle tenses and freezes. A million potential horrors flicker through my mind.

It’s just my husband, my brain reassures, and I begin to relax. His snoring has gotten worse and worse as the years have passed. On bad nights, he’s been known to even wake himself up with it, never mind my own oft troubled sleep. 

And the acoustics of this room have always been strange, I reason, and my heart finally slows. Our new house is far bigger than the old, and we don’t have furniture enough to fill it yet. A Chief’s salary will pay the mortgage, but not much else, it seems. Sound echoes and fills the empty spaces in ways it shouldn’t, taunting me with possibility of what might be lurking. 

I roll over to rub his back, which tends to ease the snoring and guide him back to a deeper slumber. I laugh to myself as I imagine the smile he’ll crack at my wild imagination when I tell him this story over breakfast. 

My hand pats the empty bed, first with soft confusion and then with a more frantic, desperate search. A thread of icy remembrance slips down my spine. My husband left for deployment this morning, the first since we moved to this new house.

It was late at night and we were alone together in the car. She sat silently, not on her phone, not reading, staring blankly. She looked so forlorn, sitting there alone. There was an unusual sense of familiarity in her presence. I couldn’t place it. 

The lights of the train car flashed out as we shot through the tunnel, and she disappeared before my eyes. For those brief seconds she had gone completely. I held my breath- something was wrong. The light returned and so did she, staring directly at me. Her eyes were red, she was tired, but there was something insidious lurking behind them. I tried to look away but I couldn’t, she was so beautiful, so powerful. She looked as though she needed to tell me something, to warn me. 

I knew something had changed in that moment. The place in which the two of us existed was not reality, time had ceased. We were locked in this gaze that had caused it to stop. I wasn’t breathing, but I was fine. She wouldn’t let anything bad happen to me. The train shook as we barreled down the tracks, moving according to its schedule although time was no longer progressing. She held me captive in her scrutiny, her eyes like shackles that bound me to this endless moment. I found myself standing at this point. The train was shaking violently now, but I had to get closer. I needed to put an end to this. I walked towards her slowly, carefully, silently. I wanted to touch her. I needed to touch her. She held my gaze as I approached her. I reached out my hand, she reciprocated. When our hands met, I felt nothing but cold glass. 

I collapsed. It was done."

Zach looked up. ""Damn.""

""No rain in the forecast, though,"" John added as an afterthought. ""That's nice.""

They stared into the dark sky a little longer. A log shifted and the fire popped, making the men jump and sending floating embers high into the sky.

They looked at one another, the orange light illuminating their startled faces. After a moment, they both broke out in a quiet chuckle, which quickly led to uproarous laughter.

""I don't know, man. I don't see shit.""

""Fuck, dude,"" John said, rising from his chair. ""I'll go check myself.""

Zach watched him as he crashed off into the dark. He was making sure to be obnoxiously loud. After a few minutes, he turned back around.

""Nothin', Zach,"" John said, tramping his way back to the campfire. ""See?""

Zach's gaze was fixed upwards, almost in shock.

""Zach?"" John asked. ""What the fuck man?"" A drop hit John's head. Then another.

My younger sister used to have it as her room. The Room is across the hall from my room, and its nearly always empty. Except at night. 

 It happened a year ago. It was time for bed, so I brushed my teeth, changed into my pajamas, closed the Room’s door and got into bed. I read for a little while, then shut my bedside lamp off and snuggled under the covers, taking precautions to keep my feet and hands under the blanket. Everyone knows to keep your limbs inside the blanket. 

Although it was late at night and I had had a busy day, I just couldn’t bear to shut my eyes. I tossed and turned and tried to fall asleep, but it just wasn’t going to happen. I rolled over to face the doorway that had the hallway light flushing in.
 
Something felt wrong. The house was eerily quiet. Then I noticed it, the Room door was wide open. The black abyss appeared to be staring back at me. I was sure I had closed it! I knew I shouldn’t be afraid, but there was just something off about that room that just made me want to close it off from the rest of the house. And I was right. 

As I stared at the doorway, trying to convince myself nothing was wrong, a tiny, wrinkly, ash-gray arm slithered out of the darkness of the Room. I tried to close my eyes, but something told me I had to keep watching it. Its’ arm hung in midair, its gnarly hand limp. Then it started waving at me. I didn’t know what to do. The house had gone from an eerie silence to having a low buzzing sound. Kind of like when the electricity turns back on after the power being out. 

Then, the creature leaned forward. It face was something noone can accurately describe. It seemed to be twisted into a knot, with two gaping holes where the eyes should have been. Its mouth had a hundred sharp teeth that formed a gross, sinister grin. Its gnarled skin looked dry and cracked. Then, the hallway light went out. We were in pitch blackness. 

The house had gone back to a still silence, until I heard the soft sound of something crawling across the carpet. I slipped my head under the covers, and held my breath. I stayed as still as possible. I heard the creature breathing and smelled its rancid breath. Suddenly, the hallway light flicked back on. The light shone into my room and seemed to scare the creature. I listened to it quickly shuffle away from my bed and back into the Room. I didn’t dare move. I stayed up all night, petrified.

When the sun finally rose, I slowly got up and glanced into the Room. The Room was empty, with no sign of what had happened only a few hours ago. Maybe I dreamt it, but to this day I still double-check that I shut that door, for who knows what will happen next time it’s open."

I look sad. No, I *am* sad. 

I turn my head to the left and examine a handprint across my face. It is bright red, and I wince when I lightly touch it. 

I lift up my shirt and examine my shoulder. It has a mark on it most likely gotten from a strong pinch. 

Then I pull down my pants and examined my buttocks. I see large imprints, as if from a large tool. I, like my face, wince when I touch them. 

Tears start to run down my face. I feel faint, so I grabb onto the sink, fearing the worst. 

What did I do to deserve all this?

While she hurts me, my mother says “it’s out of love.” My father can’t really say anything logical because he’s usually home drunk. 

So, I must deserve all this, right?

Right?

I wipe away my tears, look at myself in the mirror again, and sigh deeply.

“Just a couple more years, and then you’ll be out of this house and away from them.”

Suddenly, I hear shouts from upstairs. “No!” screams my 9 year old brother. “Come here!” my mother screams back. Then all is silent.

But the silence is short-lived. 

I hear multiple whacks, the familiar sound of a cooking spoon on my brother’s buttocks. Each whack is accompanied by a blood-curdling “ow”. Each “ow” makes my heart drop and my tears flow faster. Among these screams are my mother’s voice, shouting “You are in bed for a week! You’re an awful child!”

Suddenly, I hear my father open the front door and slam it forcefully. He’s drunk, I whisper. He screams my name, along with some expletives. “Get down here now!” he shouts. 

I look back in the mirror. My house has become a cacophony of dissonance. My little brother is screaming in pain, my other siblings are crying in fear, my mother is berating my brother, and my father is drunkenly shouting my name. 

My parents always say all this is my fault. They must be right, right?

Right?"
efy7gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/efy7gu/end_of_holidays_contest_2019/,End of Holi-Days Contest 2019!,31,4,1577381453.0,"Well, this is awkward. Seems like in my celebration of the holidays, I kinda forgot to post the contest for the Holiday's this year...

Yeah, I'm an idiot, and I apologize for messing it up. However, every mistake is an opportunity to adapt and overcome.

So here's what we're going to do:

* If you have posted a Holiday themed story, please leave it in the comment section of this post, and it will be grandfathered into the new contest. However, if it isn't posted below, there's no way for me to be able to find it since there isn't any tag in the title.


* Since the holidays have passed and I don't want to force anyone into continuing to beat a dead horse, this contest will be dual themed. Authors may post stories about the Holidays (stories themed around Christmas, Hanukkah, or Holiday themed) or our other theme, The End of Holi-Days; basically, stories themed around the end of the world. Zombies, robots, aliens, bugs, or bacteria, it all counts just as long as our world comes to a terribly depressing end. If authors want to write about a holiday-themed apocalypse, knock yourselves out!


* As this is the season for giving, the Top Runner Ups will also receive prizes, so there's a much higher chance of winning something if you don't come out on top.

##RULES AND REGS##

* Stories must be Holiday or Apocalypse themed. If you want to do both, go right on ahead!
All contest entries, whether Holiday themed or Apocalypse themed, must be tagged with [End of Holi-days 2019]. No-tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are as seen, with a capitalization of the ""E"" in ""End"" and the ""H"" in Holi-days, and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results, so some stories don't come up unless it is tagged correctly.

* All entries must adhere to the standard subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. One every 24 hours as our rule is typical.

* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate. They may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions!

* Top 5 Upvoted Stories are the winners. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winner's circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times, but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winner's circle due to ties and multiple placements.

Henry quickly pulled back. He nearly fell over, an arm swapping through the air. It nearly hit the coffee mug. 

But he managed to steady himself in time, gripping the sides of the heavy oak desk. 

And he watched as the words gnawed and gnashed. They sounded like a pencil being tapped on wood. Hungering. 

The words sought to partake in the flesh of their creator, to savor the taste of his ink, but all they found was emptiness."

Katrina looked at her desk, trying to calm her nerves. She must go deep inside and ignore the bullying. Her father warned her many times about losing her temper. 

“Daddy says I’m his Little Princess….” Beth and the girls continued taunting. 

They weren’t teasing her just because she had bright red hair, or that she had said those words in defense; they were trying to make “it” happen again. 

Katrina continued to focus, head down, studying the doodles on her notebook, trying to escape the rage building inside. Her skin was prickled, the hair on her arms standing, quivering, even her desk seemed to be vibrating mimicking her nerves.

Once before, she had lost her temper, causing her hair to raise like static electricity when pulling off a sweater. Beth and the girls continually tried to make “it” happen again. 

“Freak!” They called her, gathering around her laughing. No, she would remain calm.

<Bam!>

Katrina’s vision went black, blurry as she opened her eyes, sight impeded by the fast swelling of her eye socket, the sting ricocheting through her skull then body.

Disbelief… “She hit me… She actually hit me!” 

Rage... Her hair now rose, surpassing the previous frayed static movement, swirling, forming strands, writhing, now resembling the flames of a fire enraged by fuel. Her desk lifted, hovering several inches from the floor vibrating.

As she raised her head, everything in the classroom, every desk, every student except for Beth slammed to the walls, pinned mid-way to the ceiling. The energy causing the lights to spark and flicker, filling the room with the pungent smell of ozone.

Beth floated rigidly, as if being crucified, tears of terror streaming from her face.

Katrina couldn’t find the language for what she was feeling as she approached Beth, it was far more intense than rage, any word attempting to describe it would be left wanting.

She looked directly into Beth’s eyes as her hair continued to flow menacingly to the sides and above her head. 

“Daddy says “It’s my world and I get to choose who I name as the villain…”” inches now between their noses “I choose to bestow that honor upon my own name.”

She gripped Beth’s head with both hands, absorbing her soul, Beth’s shriveled ashen corpse falling limply to the floor.

Her father hoped she would choose to use her powers to defend humanity. In her rage, she recognized that the true evil resided within these cruel beings themselves.

Her hair now flowing, twisting and twirling on top of her head forming a flame-like crown. 

Yes, she had been Daddy’s little princess…. 

But she has now awakened to claim her throne."
efurig,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/efurig/the_day_after_christmas/,The day after Christmas,88,3,1577362400.0,"It’s the day after Christmas and all is quiet. Elise is up, running around, and playing with her new toys as her parents sleep. She plays with her dolls, a new video game, and puts on her kiddie makeup.

Time flies by as she is having fun. Day turns to night and still, her parents sleep. Elise gorges herself on leftover Christmas cookies, candy, and cold Christmas ham. She drinks what’s left of her milk, juice, and water from the tap.

After two days pass, she starts to get worried, having forgotten about her parents while playing. She gently knocks on their bedroom door, not wanting to get into trouble. When her parents don’t answer, she opens the bedroom door quietly, and peeks in. What she sees horrifies her.

Her parents’ bedroom is drenched in blood. Her mother is lying in bed, her nightgown a deep shade of red as her lifeless body stares up at the ceiling. Her father, or what’s left of him, is on the ground. His Christmas pajamas unrecognizable as his head is missing from his body.

Elise screams in terror, running away as fast as her little legs can carry her. She opens her front door and runs barefoot into the snowy morning. All she sees is chaos. Bodies strewn about on front lawns, snow that should be white is almost black, children screaming and crying, and pets wandering around aimlessly.

Elise runs to her neighbor’s house and tries to open the door, but it is locked. She pulls as hard as her little arms will allow, when a paw is placed firmly on her shoulder. Too afraid to turn around, Elise sobs as she stares straight ahead.

“Elise, how was your Christmas?” A deep voice booms behind her.

“It-it was good,” she cracked as snot drips down her face.

“Why are you crying if you had a good Christmas?” The voice questions, elongating the words as they’re spoken.

“My mommy and daddy are dead!” She screams and turns around. A man over six feet tall, dressed in a poor man’s Santa outfit stares down at her. Carrying an axe in one paw and a wearing a satchel, his yellow eyes smile mischievously down at her. Shivering, Elise tries to leave but the man grabs her by the arm, scratching her in the process.

“Yes, your mother and father are dead. But I did give you, and all of the other kids in this neighborhood the greatest gift of all: no rules, no timeouts, and certainly no adults! Enjoy it while it lasts,” He winks, turning on his heel and disappearing into the woods surrounding the neighborhood, leaving the kids to fend for themselves."
eftwun,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/eftwun/a_ghastly_dream/,A ghastly dream,9,0,1577355879.0,"déjà vu... That's what it felt like.. When I was 14 I had this ghastly dream. In this dream, my mother and I went shopping and I had this horrible feeling that someone or rather something followed us. Now and then I would see this blue creature try to hurt my mom and everytime I got close to her it would dissappear. When I woke up I wouldn't remember the dream at all.

Now you're probably wondering how would you write this if you couldn't remember... Well that's what I'm trying to figure out.. And it haunts me to this day..

When my mom and I would go out shopping I had this intense feeling that something bad would happen but couldn't quite put my finger on it. During our outing she would often hurt herself by accidentally knocking her shopping cart or bumping into something or tripping. And this wasn't once or twice. I ignored it eventually thinking my mom was clumsy until the day of another outing she grabbed a packet of gummy bears with blue and black printing on it and then a blueberry juice... Weirded out because she hates blueberries and almost immediately after that she tripped and fell.. It's when I had this feeling of déjà vu... I tried thinking when had this happened but realized it was in a dream... After realizing it I've never had the dream again nor has my mom gotten hurt during shopping..

To this day I've wondered if that creature is real, what could it be and why it targeted my mom specifically."

A lot of unfortunate things happened to Amir on Christmas. 

It was unfortunate he thought the heavy boots on his roof were Santa and his helpers.

It was unfortunate he thought sneaking downstairs as he followed the sound of footsteps moving down the side of his house was a good idea.  

It was unfortunate he never realized his daddy was on the naughty list of many, many people because of what he helped plan many years before. 

It was unfortunate that those people never forgot what Amir’s daddy helped plan. 

It was unfortunate that after 18 years, they finally found Amir’s daddy. 

It was unfortunate that those people wanted revenge, not justice.

It was unfortunate that Amir was the first person they saw when they snuck into the house.

It was unfortunate for those people that they didn’t have an excuse to blow off his head right there. 

It was unfortunate for Amir that he gave them one when he screamed:

“You aren’t Santa Clause!”

efmmgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/efmmgs/grandmas_room/,Grandma's Room,28,3,1577312023.0,"Archie's Grandma was his best friend, he loved everything about her from her wicked sense of humour to the way she could always make him feel better with her stories about the old days. Grandma Gracie was full of life, 80 years old and still gardening and doing all her own housework. She refused point blank to be seen as or thought of as a little old lady. Gracie seemed to have more energy than the rest of the village put together, she could always be counted upon to show up at village fetes with her famous cakes or help out at the litter pick. 

Her death shook the village to it's core, nobody could believe that Gracie, so full of life and laughter, could so suddenly have gone. Shocked neighbours stood on the village common in little groups talking in hushed tones or gathered in each others living rooms to remember her, to speak of her life and to grieve.  

Archie wanted nobodies company but Gracie's and for the first time in his life, after 12 years of being his constant companion, she was not by his side. Bitter tears gave way to a silent stillness as Archie sat alone on the stairs, refusing to speak, not wanting to eat or interact with anyone. The young boy withdrew into himself and nothing that anybody did or said seemed to make any difference to his mood. The funeral came and went with Archie shedding no further tears and showing no emotion at all, he seemed to those around him to have switched off. 

At home Archie was now spending most of his time in the bedroom nearest the bathroom. The room that had been his grandmother's. His parents would find him hours after he had gone upstairs, simply sat on her bed or lounging in her chair staring into space. 

A week after the funeral, Archie's parents had to leave him alone, both had to return to work to avoid losing their jobs. They both returned at 6pm and finding the house quiet they assumed they'd find Archie once again alone in his grandmother room. They came to a silent agreement that now was the time to speak to him, to try to get him to go outside or do something different. As they both stood at the foot of the stairs about to go up to him they were surprised to hear the sound of laughter floating down. 

Grinning at each other, relieved that Archie had recovered from his melancholy they rushed up the stairs eager to see their son smiling again. 

""Faster Grandma, Faster""

The grins faded to looks of worry and apprehension, had Archie lost his mind?

As they opened the door to the bedroom closest to the bathroom, they saw Archie sat in Gracie's chair, a chair that was spinning round at a tremendous speed. Stood behind the chair, covered in earth and still in her funeral best, was Gracie. "

I was standing in the shadow of the tree under the street light. It was a good hiding spot to surprise them. To add to element of mystery, I decided to wear the Santa suit. Also, it went along with the season’s spirit too.

They should have been here by now, I thought. Maybe they got stuck up in the traffic. You can never predict traffic in this city; especially this time of the year.

I chuckled softly thinking of how surprised they are going to be.

While I was waiting, I lit up a cigarette. I was half-way through the smoke when I heard a scooter approaching and it stopped a few yards from me.

Annie was driving the scooter and Rose was in the back seat clutching hard at her mom’s sweater. She was almost four but still afraid of scooters. Both of them looked just as lovely as I remember seeing them when they were leaving the house this afternoon. Although, Rose did look a little upset about something.

I still had a few puffs left to smoke but I threw it away anyway. I adjusted my Santa bag around my shoulder before I started walking towards them slowly.

*******

I hope Dave is ready with the surprise because that is the only thing that can get Rose out of this mood now. We had passed by a toy store and she saw some truck that she wanted. It took her a lot of convincing to make her stop crying but it looked like she was still grieving over it.

Looking at her dad dressed as the Santa would cheer her up; I tried to convince this to myself as I parked the scooter infront of our house.

“Get down, honey”

Rose jumped off from the side and ran towards the gate while I was trying to put the scooter on the side stand. She was waiting for me to come and help her open the gate.

That was when I saw Dave coming out of the shadows. He must have been waiting for some time and that is what made him a good dad. He always went an extra mile for Rose. But still I didn’t think he would have been waiting for us outside.

It was only when he came into the light that I saw a crowbar in one of his hands. I realized this a few seconds too late that it was not Dave.

“RUN!” I turned around to Rose and screamed. She was too much into shock and was not able to process what was going on with her mom’s sudden shift of tone.

The last thing I remember seeing was Rose’s teary face and the last thing I remember feeling was the crowbar hitting me on the head.

The next time I opened my eyes, I was in the graveyard standing next to Rose and our bodies lay infront of us."

I'm not sure if I'm alive or not.

I've been in this moment for the longest time. I know it is strange, but I can't help but feel it. The moment I die, I'm reincarnated as human, as a human living in a human body. I feel I'm still alive, but I'm not. I don't know how to feel. I don't want to feel. But it feels *good*. Just as good as I do.

This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to die. And maybe, just maybe, I'll return to my body. I know this is impossible, but it feels better than anything. I'm going to die and maybe, just maybe, I'll return to my body.

I can't tell if this is a dream or if I'm simply imagining. I'm going to die, and maybe, just maybe, I'll come back to my body. So I'm going to die. And maybe I'll come back to my body. Or maybe I'll die and I won't be reincarnated as a human, and I'll be a human who dies and lives again."

My son who was seating in the back seat of the car said “I second that”. We were coming back from a trip to our hometown and it was Sunday around noon. 

We made this same trip every few months to visit friends and family, but this time coming back was a little different. We had to take a detour because the main highway was blocked with a major traffic accident. 
We had to go back a couple of miles and find an alternate route; this new route took us through some small towns in rural Texas we have never been through before. 

We've always enjoyed exploring the byways but we were a little pressed for time since we had to work the following day. We always liked to have at least a full afternoon to rest after a trip and we didn’t know how long this way was going take us. In any case, we were all hungry and we were coming into a small town.  

We didn’t noticed the name but it was one of those dying towns that seem to be barely clinging to life. Nonetheless, it was a quaint little place, and best of all, there were a few places to eat. 
We drove around for a bit trying to decide where to have lunch. We had past by this restaurant in a corner in the downtown area that seemed nice. We found a parking spot and went in. 

The place had a German theme and the decor was old but nice. We were seated right away and the waitress was very friendly. We ordered our food and it was ready very quickly. The food was not great but it was a lot better than some we’ve had in other places. 

Our son spent most of his time on his phone watching videos and texting his friends as children nowadays often do.  It was time to pay the bill and head out, so I called the waitress and asked for the check. She came back shortly after and I paid her. 
We walked out of the restaurant and over to the car which was parked around the corner from the place. We got in the car and got ready to leave when our son yelled “stop! I forgot my phone in the restaurant!” I shut the car off and told him to go back and get it. 
He took a bit longer than he should and when he finally came back, he had a baffled look in his face. 
He climbed into the car and said “the place is closed!” I said ""that can’t be, we just walked out not five minutes ago, go back and knock on the door, they’re in there, they have to clean up...! and ""no"", he interrupted, ""you don’t understand! The place is closed and it seems like it has been closed for a long time, it looks old and run down. I don’t know what’s going on”.  
My wife and I turned to look at him, I said, ""let’s go see"", thinking that he didn’t want to knock because he’s a young boy, and sometimes they act a little weird (or a lot). 
We both got out of the car and walked around the corner to the restaurant. To my surprise and disbelief, the place looked dilapidated as if it had been abandoned for a long time, it didn’t look like that when we went in, at least not that I noticed. 

I tried to see through the glass on the door but was not able to make out anything inside. Then, I saw an old woman sweeping the sidewalk next door to the place and I walked over to her and asked her about the place. She said, “that restaurant has been closed for more than 20 years"". 
She said that the owners had left after a legal battle with the city and that’s why the place was just abandoned.
I told her that we had just been in there, and she said that we better be careful because if the police were to see us breaking in we would be in trouble. 
I didn’t want to say anything else to her, I knew how it would’ve sounded, we walked back to the car scratching our heads. 
Then as we were walking by a window on the side of the restaurant, I looked at the inside of the place. I could see the table we had sat at, it was full of dust and cobwebs everywhere. 

The paintings on the walls were crooked and some were on the floor as they had fallen from the wall where they had been, but right there, on the corner of the table, there it was, my son’s phone. 
I got my phone out of my pocket and called his, I could see the screen lighting up, but nothing on the table seem disturbed, there was no indication of anybody having been in there. We got in the car and left. 

The ride back to the house was very quiet; I thought we were confused enough, so I didn’t tell my son or my wife that I had seen the phone through the window. To this day, I have no idea what happened there. 

All I can say is that we never went that way again. It’s been many years since that trip but I still remember like it was yesterday, and still get chills thinking about it."

**(Translated from Cantonese)**

I hate Christmas because it's the hardest time of the year for me. I wasn't always this resentful, though. I use to beam like the sun, but that was a long time ago.

Now, I'm a grunt; all of us are. We toil and live at the discretion of masters that couldn't fathom our existences. Criminals dare not hope for more than that, so we dare not hope at all. This is reality in the gulag.

Some sow, others solder, even more configure, but all must work, or be devoured by the beast. We are mice to our hawkish overseers. They soar overhead scanning for fracturing obedience. Today though, their behavior is erratic. I heard, our working conditions were leaked to the western world in a very shameful way. So of course, they're itching to restore our confidence in their dominance.

Even from here Wan's cluelessness to these subtleties is obvious, as his emaciated body saunters aimlessly through the working masses. Doubtlessly, he's been missing quota, a lot of us have, and if you don't work you don't eat. Unfortunately, this is the worst time to be in a stupor, and Wan, is beelining towards disaster. I try to intercede, but my attempts to warn him only hasten that outcome. And when he knocks over a guard, his fate is sealed, poor Wan.

Our eyes meet, but I don't offer any sentiments. What good could they do him now? He's destined for the beast. The guard pulls Wan along. They halt just outside the beast's enclosure. Its edifice fortified by cinder blocks that etch out the dimensions of a cube. Its door akin to tank armor rather than material for a proper entry way, but all things considered, maybe that's best.

Despite its physique, the door isn't impermeable. It has one rectangular view-port carved into it, that sits at a normal man's eye level, and three fist sized air holes that hang a foot above the ground.

A grin flits across the guards face. He, now a fire with enthusiasm, clenches the keys secured about his trousers. They jingle as he searches them for the door's only key. Of course, this is all spectacle. He knows that key by heart. he's savoring Wan's misery. After, he's had his fill, the guard inserts the key into the door. The lock clinks to acceptance, then he swings the door open.

Wan peers into an abyss. Urine flows down his leg pooling at his feet. As it slows to a trickle the the guard shoves him into the cell and slams the door shut. The force sends Wan reeling to his knees. Wan ignores the pain, though. Instead, he's transfixed on the beast. Its appearance is maddening. Wan couldn't conjure this vision, let alone reason with it if he tried, yet, overcome, Wan attempts an emotional appeal. Its wasted though. I'm no longer his friend. I am the beast."

""Christmas!"" one of them whispered, climbing out of their bed.

""I wonder what we got this year!"" another said, despite knowing exactly what to expect.

They left the room and made their way down the hallway together, so united in their childlike wonder that they acted as one. The view was as grim as usual- simple concrete walls and a single metal door at the far end of the hall- but nothing could dampen their spirits.

One of the boys dared to pull the door's handle, and as it did only once every year, the door began to open. Slowly, carefully, he pulled the door enough so that he could fit through.

The chamber was decorated as it always was, with the same red and green lights wrapped around the same fake Christmas tree. There were seven boxes at the base of the tree- one for each boy- and a plate with seven cookies waiting on the ground nearby. Of course, a camera sat atop the tree, as it did every year.

One boy immediately ran for his cookie. It was his favorite part of the entire year, that one delicious treat to look forward to after what felt like decades in the room at the other end of the hall. As soon as he finished it, his crumb-covered mouth began to water in anticipation of next year's cookie.

Another boy frantically began searching for his present in the pile. As soon as he found it, he tore the wrapping paper away and pulled the frame out of the box. While the picture was partially obscured by the leaves and other foliage, he could clearly recognize his mother's face. She was in her garden, wiping sweat from her brow. It must have been taken in the summer.

Soon, the rest of the boys joined him, gazing upon pictures of their relatives for the first time since last Christmas. One boy cried when he saw his sister's face, as he hasn't gotten a picture of her since he was first taken, back when he was truly a boy. He barely recognized his sister's face, and wondered if she would possibly recognize his beneath the pale, scarred skin.

They spent the entire day silently gazing upon their gifts. When the warning bell began to ring, they left the pictures behind and returned to their room without daring to allow the bell to ring again.

They slept peacefully that night, their spirits healed just enough to endure another year before seeing their families again.

However, they weren't fooled by this gesture. Every one of them knew that this was just another form of torture.

They knew that they lived in Hell, but on days like this, it felt more like Purgatory."

So when he saw the dusty tome in the back of his favorite arcane shop, he knew he had to buy it. 

That night, he opened the book to a random page. It seemed to contain detailed instructions on summoning an unspeakable demon, Be'laakrah. Excitedly, Sam sent a text to Marty and Abe, his two best friends. These things were always more exciting, more exhilarating, with some friends.

Although they were skeptical, the two were over quickly. When they arrived, Sam already had his room set up for the ritual. 

Marty looked around the room apprehensively. He was always a little nervous about these things; the knife, pentagram, and incense in the room did nothing to alleviate his fears. ""I'm not sure about this, guys,"" he said. ""This looks a lot more genuine than the other ones we pretended to summon."" 

""Who's pretending?"" Retorted Sam. 

Always looking to impress, Abe teased Marty. ""You chicken?"" He asked. He proceeded to walk around the room, flapping his arms and clucking. 

Blushing, Marty backed down. ""Alright, alright... what do we gotta do, Sam?"" 

Sam looked down at the tome in his hands. Everything felt much more real right now. He lit the incense by the doorframe, the only entrance in or out of the room. ""So... according to the book, Be'laakrah needs permission to access this earthly plane. If each of us says his name and then exits the doorway, we grant him permission to enter."" 

Without further thought, he harshly cried, ""Be'laakrah!"" and walked through the door. He then gestured towards Abe. 

Abe looked at Sam, who was watching expectantly. Trying to act tough, he muttered the demon's name and walked through the door. Both Sam and Abe turned to Marty, who was as white as a sheet. 

""Guys, I dont know about this..."" he stuttered, only to be cut off by the squawking imitation of a chicken from his friends. His face set with resolve. With determination, he yelled, ""Be'laakrah!"" And turned towards the door, about to step through. And stopped. 

It stood before him in all of its grotesque glory, blocking his entrance through the doorway. 

Abe let out a squeak. His pants became wet as the smell of urine pervaded the air. Sam just stood there, his eyes wide. 

The creature looked at Marty, who's knees were trembling. It pointed at him and opened one of its mouths. A hollow, rasping noise came out. ""...do not...summon...Be'laakrah..."" Somehow, the creature looked terrified. 

And then it disappeared. 

The three young men looked at each other. Sam threw up, his vomit spattering on the carpet. Abe wasn't aware of the mess on his pants. Marty couldn't move. He was looking at his friends. 

The ritual wasn't complete, and there was only one way to leave the room. It was through the doorway. 

He knew he would have to go through eventually."

I live alone in a small house in the outskirts of Vegas, just me and my cat Murphy. We’ve been partners for close to 5 years now and been through love,  heartbreak, power and water shut-offs, and all the ups and downs that life throws your way in half a decade’s time. I bought this home foreclosing just six months ago in not the best of neighborhoods but money has always been tight and mortgage payment beat renting in the long run. Things have been pretty smooth since, we’ve only heard a few sets of sirens since moving in. Well, smooth until last week that was. Going about my regular morning business one day, I walked past my patio door, and saw an oily smudge on the glass near head level. I really didn’t register it the first moment I saw it but as I poured my cereal it really clicked in my head. I hadn’t put my face against that window and I hadn’t had any company recently so it couldn’t have come from anyone I knew. 
Fuck it, maybe some would-be thief thought to check out what goods I might have in my house and saw there wasn’t anything worth the trouble inside. It was morning after all and I had seen no sign of trouble in the house. The smudge could’ve been from last week for all I knew. I was cutting it close with time before I had to leave for work so my mind wandered off to other things like grabbing my wallet and making sure the cat had food and water before leaving. 

10 hours later, I was finally home, after dark but thankful I didn’t have to work a 12. I tossed my wallet and keys on the kitchen counter and went upstairs to unwind the day’s stresses. Bathroom, shower, change. I walked out of the bathroom and the lighting from outside hit just right that a smudge on my bedroom window caught my eye as I headed to bed. 
“What the fuck!” 
I was actually creeped out now, my window was high up and it meant some clown had to have gone through the trouble of actually putting up a ladder to get to it. I turned on the lights and checked my little stash of cash beneath the mattress (I know, cliche spot) shooing Murphy away in the process. It was intact. He must be planning on robbing me later, I’ll buy a couple broken cameras from eBay and put them up as a deterrent, I thought. You have to understand, buying a gun is kind of expensive and I’d rather do everything I can before having to shoot someone inside and probably lowering my home’s sell value. I went downstairs, lighting every part of the house as I walked through it and got the Windex+ paper towel and headed back up to my room. I slid the window open and put my hand out with the paper towel drenched in windex to clean up the smudge. I scrubbed and nothing happened. 

I realized the smudges were on the inside."
efan3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/efan3h/the_third_list/,The Third List,237,7,1577240302.0,"Nice kids are put on the nice list. They get presents. They get rewarded for everything they've done throughout the year with whatever they want, sometimes even if it's undeserved.

Naughty kids are put on the naughty list. They don't get presents. The ones who aren't as special as the nice kids get punished with either absolutely nothing, or receive nothing more than black coal.

But there's another list, too. 

Every Christmas, Santa chooses approximately 500 random children to put on the third list. Those children wake up to Santa standing over their bed, opening up his famous sack and inviting them to look inside.

But the sack doesn't just carry presents.

The children are all carried to the North Pole to a remote location. They were all promised to be able to spend a day with Santa, and that's what they all got! They got to see Santa, see his reindeer, and get a view of the behind the scenes of Christmas.

But the children never come back.

Santa orders that the children never go back to their lives of luxury and happiness. Instead, Santa has the children stay with him forever. Forever and ever.

And so the children are trapped in the North Pole. They're all trapped, forced to read endless letters from innocent children, forced to create endless presents for innocent children. They can no longer enjoy Christmas once they have to make Christmas.

All because they were put on the third list.

Where did you think the elves came from?"

The woman hung up as she weaved through parking lot traffic; several cars flipped their turn signals on as she struggled to remove her keys from her purse—shopping bags dangled on her forearms. She placed the bags in the backseat as snowflakes brushed her face. Suddenly, a loud bang as from a car crash filled the parking lot, followed by screams. She looked around hastily. A man honked and threw his hands up in a large truck awaiting her parking space. The screams continued, childrens’ and adult’s.

She looked around maneuvering through parked cars. The man in the truck flipped her off as black smoke billowed from the exhaust.

“Help, somebody, please!” A woman cried.

She moved toward the voice and incessant screams, and nobody seemed to be concerned; several people looked around drinking their Starbucks but simply carried on in their own holiday cheer.

“Mommy! Where are you!”

Panic overtook the woman as she trotted in front of shoppers. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ A man yelled with his family.

Her breathing grew heavy. “How come… nobody hears this?”

“Michelle! Somebody, *please* help us! Oh, God, please!”

“Hang on!” The woman screamed. Shoppers and traffic carried on.

The woman followed the children’s cries until she stopped between two large vehicles. Several people stood around a mounted speaker. The screams and cries ceased.

“Merry Christmas, ma’am.” A man shook her hand, followed by another man and woman.

“What’s…” The woman caught her breath. “What’s going on here?”

The other man chimed in, “Everything is *A-Okay.* We’re with the city.”

“I don’t understand?” She looked around confusingly.

The other woman replied. “You’re the only person in over a dozen shopping centers to respond today. You did the right thing in being helpful to others in need this holiday season.”

“Oh? Isn’t this extreme?”

“Is it?” The first man asked, pulling out paper from his coat. “What if this really had happened to such a family?”

The woman smiled and nodded.

“And on behalf of the mayor and channel 9, we would like to give you and your family a thousand dollar check.”

“Wow!” She accepted it. “Thank you *so* much. You don’t know how much this will help my husband and I out this year.”

“No, really, thank you misses…”

“Saunter.”

He shook her hand. “Mrs. Saunter. Merry Christmas.”

“Merry Christmas.” She shook their hands and parted ways.

She walked joyfully back to her vehicle, gazing at her newly gained money which would provide for her household a wonderful Christmas, and even help pay down some debt. But as she crossed a busy aisle, a loud honk filled her ears and a car slid into her. The check floated up and away with the wind and snow.

Her vision grew blurry as footsteps and screams surrounded her. And now the screams for help were as real as ever."

Even as we got older we loved seeing him in that costume. It was the highlight of the holidays when he'd emerge from kitchen with a huge sack full of presents.

Every year around October he would start planning that years ""Santa Visit"" and each year it would get more elaborate as he pulled out all the stops to make Christmas really special. From hiring several live reindeer to bringing along an entire busload of elves we always knew we were in for a real treat. 

This year he kept hinting at something really big and special, several times we heard him muttering ""the best one yet"" to himself as he pored over his laboriously collated plans for the event. He'd always name his Santa Visit events and this year's was no different. 

""Down the chimney"" was what the police found written on front page of his planning.

And that's where they found him. They said he'd got stuck and suffocated while practising his stunt. His sack of presents had fallen onto his face muffling his cries for help. He'd died slowly.

A tragic accident.

I hoped and prayed. Sent Santa so many letters.

Soon, December twenty-fourth arrived. Then came midnight. As far as I knew, not a creature was stirring. Daddy’s holiday playlist all I heard. 

To my delight, I heard thumping over the music. Then came a thud downstairs.

I entered the living room. There was daddy at the towering tree. He reached inside the branches, spilling several ornaments.

“Dad,"" I said.

My father whirled around. Red stains scattered across his beard and pajamas. “Helene! Why aren’t you in bed?”

 “I couldn’t sleep, daddy.""

His cold stare fixated on me. “You shouldn't have come down here.""

Frozen in fear, I looked around the room. “I just wanted to see Santa.”

Dad reached back toward the tree.

Heavy footsteps startled me. I turned to see a smiling man . 

The red and white hat made his identity obvious. As did the big belly. But even in the red jacket, Santa wasn’t what I expected. The beard was too dirty. Santa’s face too angular.

Santa slammed his sack of toys onto daddy’s head.

Dad fell to the ground. His groans quieted once Santa threw the bag down over and over again.

Sweating, Santa Claus dropped the heavy bag.

On the floor, dad laid motionless. His face in slimy smithereens.

I looked toward Santa.

His smile reassured me. Calm, Santa pointed toward the Fraser Fir.

Buried in the tree, I saw what daddy was about to grab: a long knife.

Then I saw what else the Fraser Fir had been hiding...

Mom’s body lied behind it. A clean red line ran across her throat.

I looked at dad’s corpse. The man who was my father. And my mother’s killer.

A supportive grip grabbed my arm. I faced Santa.

“You’ll be fine, Helene,” he said in a gentle voice

Enraptured, I watched Santa hold up a few ripped pieces of notebook paper. Instantly, I recognized the scribbled scrawlings. Recognized my many Christmas lists for the North Pole.

“I’ve been listening,” Santa told me. “Now you'll be in my family, Helene.”

I showed a smile. At seven years old, I was finally free.

Santa led me outside. To a red convertible.

We both got in. I never once worried. Not even when that convertible took up off the ground. Nor when the radio gave way to an emergency news bulletin...

“A patient from the Americus Mental Hospital broke out just a few hours ago,” a panicking reporter told us. “The suspect is Kris Kringle, a man dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. He was committed for several child kidnappings in 2006 and is considered extremely dangerous.”   

Still, I didn’t care. Santa had given me a fresh start. A fresh family.

Against the wind, Santa changed stations.

I closed my eyes in the cold. Thought about our bright future. How my greatest Christmas gift had only just begun."

The cup of hot chocolate burned my hand a little, but it didn’t bother me. My other hand was resting on the window, and the cold I felt through the glass created a perfect balance. One hand hot, other cold.

It was snowing a lot. The perfect Christmas card, I thought and a calm smile stretched across my face. Everything was perfect-the hot chocolate, the snow, the dim lights of the Christmas tree on the other side of the room. I even started warming up to the Christmas music. 

It muffled the screams nicely.

I sipped the rest of my drink and turned around to face my family. My parents were on the floor, tied up and struggling to get further away from me.

“Hey, it’s not like I enjoy your company either”, I mumbled to myself. I put the mug down and slowly lifted the knife from the table. My dad's eyes widened and he tried to scream, but all that came out was muffled, incoherent panic.

“Which one will go first?” I asked silently. There were tears in my moms eyes. Tears that almost made me pity her. But the pity melted away quickly.

“Maybe I’ll start with you. Dad, watch closely”, I smiled and stepped forward. I lifted the knife to my mom's throat, ready to slice it open…

The door of my room slammed shut. I opened my eyes. They were staring straight into my mothers small, pig-like eyes. She grinned with disgust and stepped away. Her face, once beautiful but spoiled after years of living in a constant state of anger and self-pity, her horrible personality poking out of every wrinkle, every imperfection that was sprayed across her face 

“Get your worthless ass up. It’s noon”.

I didn’t reply. Instead, I slowly got out of bed, staring into my mother’s eyes the whole time. She narrowed her eyes and stared at me back, not even trying to hide the utter disgust that she had for me. 

“Go tidy up. And hide those bruises. Our relatives will visit and I don’t want to deal with the questions”.

“Go fuck yourself”, I mumbled as I walked past her, but I didn’t say it quietly enough. She grabbed my hair and forced me to turn to face her ugly face.

“What did you just say to me, you little shit?”

“Nothing”, I replied. She slapped me. I turned my face away and lifted my hand to cover up my tears.

“You truly are worthless”, she shook her head and stormed out. 

It was snowing a lot. The perfect Christmas card, I thought. The dim lights of the Christmas tree, the Christmas music. My dad, already drunk, yelling something from the other room and smashing plates.

The knife was still in my bedroom, hidden under some school books. 

Maybe next Christmas, I thought as I sipped the hot chocolate and pressed my hand to the window screen.

Maybe next Christmas I’ll do it."

Why wasn’t that turn there? 

Convinced she was just being paranoid and had already taken it, she kept going. Everything seemed normal enough. 

She could have sworn there wasn’t a hill there, though. She knew there wasn’t.

She continued to think herself paranoid, until she realized she’d been driving for fifteen minutes. She should have reached her home five minutes ago. And were the roads... repeating? As if she’d just left? 

No. That couldn’t be. She’d have to keep driving and hope. She’d find it soon.

She drove for hours. The roads repeated as if she’d just left over and over again, and the terrain was just wrong every time. She tried to stop the car, but it never let her. She was starting to see faces out there in the snow, twisted and horrible.

The bastard had left her the day of Christmas. She hated him for it. It was his favorite holiday, but that last year he couldn't appreciate it. Christmas was now cold and sad for her. It wasn't the same without him. She would give anything to have him back.

And hand on her shoulder, filled the room with warmth and color. She smiled and stood up. She couldn't do that so easily on an average night, a bad back made that task painful and hard. But Charles was here. 

He held her hand as they looked into each other eyes. No words from either. The crackle of the fire, was all either heard. She felt cold bitter tears fall down her cheeks. But she couldn't help but smile as she held him. She felt thirty years younger with him, but then again his passing aged her beyond her years.

They slow danced in each other's arms to the Christmas music playing in their heads. Charles going as far as to hum a couple. All that mattered is that they were together. The room was golden, and bright, just like his eyes. She laughed as he twirled her around and pulled her to his lips. Dancing for ever.

""I have to go.""

 He gave a sad smile, lines suddenly aging his face. Her knees bent, and her back shook with the strain of standing.

""No! Not yet! Take me with you!"" He shook his head and lifted his head towards the stairs. Her eyes followed his, up to her grandchild sitting on the stairs.

""Grandma?""

""Are you sure you want to go, and leave her behind?""

Sharon shook her head, and let go of him and held her hands out.

Five days since the last time I got a full night's sleep. I just lay there, staring at my bedroom ceiling, not really thinking about anything, just… staring. Watching the shadows dance with the pale lights of the lonesome midnight traffic. I lay, feeling my body sink into the bed, as if its weight was only an afterthought.

It's been five long and restless nights. My mind wanders through random thoughts, barely registering any one of them. Every once in a while I look at her, sleeping right next to me, and my turmoil goes away for a few seconds.

It comes back, though, relentless. I feel anxious, the fear on the back of my mind eager to put itself front and center. Even though she's there, I dread loneliness. Even though she's right there, lying on my bed, I feel alone.

I look at her. Her beautiful dark hair mirroring the darkness of the night, her peaceful slumber a stark contrast to my distress. I try to calm myself by watching her, as if her lovely image could shed away all the horror, but in reality I know this will only fuel it further.

Because, even though she's there, and I can hear her gentle breathing and I can feel her warmth, the truth is she should be lying where I said my last goodbye so many nights ago. Because, even though there's nothing that I would want more than to hold her one last time, I don't know who or what is lying right next to me, but it's not her. Because she is gone, and accepting it was the hardest thing I ever did.

My favorite meal from another time of my life seemed like garbage compared to the masterpiece laid before me. ""Bon appetit,"" said the waiter, as he left me to my meal. Charmaine, soon to be future wife, raised her glass. ""To one full year, she said. ""To one full year,"" I reciprocated. We clinked our glasses. 

Up until the day that I had met Charmaine, my life was all but dead and going nowhere. It wasnt until Charmaine had found me in an alley, a needle in my arm, and presented me a choice. For me the answer was obvious. One full year later, I was healthier, stronger, and more full of life than I had ever been. With Charmaine's support and love, I became more than I was ever meant to be. I became the man that society never believed I could be. I was strong, determined, and unstoppable. I deserved this celebration, and there was only one last thing I sought to claim... Charmaine's hand in marriage. 

I tapped my spoon to my glass and a group of men took to the stage before our table. They grabbed instruments and began playing Charmaine's favorite song. Charmaine looked at me with glossy eyes, as I from my seat, and dropped to one knee. I then presented a diamond ring, and asked for her hand in marriage. She said yes and the other patrons applauded. ""You've made me the happiest man in the world,"" I said. ""Now for the second happiest moment of my life... let's dig in!"" I had waited a year for this meal. Charmaine and I knew I deserved it. We deserved it.

We dug in, each starting with a leg. As I took my first bite, I reveled as the blood dripped from my mouth. My fangs tore the smooth flesh from the bone as my blood red eyes rolled to the back of my head. The band continued to play as the rest of the patrons continued with their meals, losing all manners, and making a bloody mess of the restaurant. ""Oh I love you, Charmain."" I said as my claws dug into the lump of flesh, blood, and bones laid before me. ""I love you too,"" replied Charmaine, drinking more of the blood from her wine glass.

We held hands and together spoke, ""To one more full year."""

eeuje8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/eeuje8/the_rat_king/,The Rat King,29,3,1577153520.0,"At night Jody heard them calling to him. They writhed and squirmed; crept and crawled. They festered  in his thoughts as he lay awake in bed and in his dreams, when he finally slept. 

Especially when he slept. 

Behind closed eyes their whiskers tickled his nose, his cheek, his chin. Their squeaks echoed in his head. 

This went on for months. And yet, Jody did  nothing because he was afraid. He dared not go to them—not at night. And in the day, when he could bear the idea of confronting them, they were never there. 

He saw one scurrying across the basement floor once, in daylight and tried to grab it. He wasn’t fast enough though and it’s little pink tail wriggled under a stack of boxes...and it was gone. 

Jody knew that if he wanted to meet them it would have to be at night. And he knew he must meet them. He must because they called to him. Over and over. And the calling wouldn’t stop. It would never stop. It would go on and on, until he did something about it. 

Six months passed. Jody couldn’t bear it any longer.   He slid out of bed, skipped his slippers and walked barefoot instead. He made his way down stairs to the cellar door. 

The door was closed. It creaked as he opened it. And it must’ve startled them because for a brief moment they stopped scurrying about. But only for a brief moment. 

Each step into the darkness felt like one step closer to his....destiny? Doom? 

As his eyes adjusted to the dark, he saw their beady black pea-eyes looking at him—sizing him up. Their noses twitched impatiently and they called to him. Their tiny voices called him closer.  

And he obliged. 

Whiskers brushed against his toes. He felt them crawling over his feet. They climbed his leg, their little padded feet cool against his warm skin. 

Inside his head, the voices—hundreds of them—became one. One rat voice that spoke clear in his mind. 

“Behold, the Rat King.” 

Furry bodies swarmed him, encircled him like a rodent cyclone. He opened his mouth to scream but nothing came out. The space was quickly filled by a curious rat. 

Jody fell to the ground, covered in a heap of fur and tails. 

There he slept, for the first time in a long time, and in his dreams he wasn’t Jody, the human. 

His vision changed. Everything looked a little bigger than it used to. And that’s not all. His sense of smell sharpened. He wanted scraps...cheese...flesh. 

Then, Jody realized the dream wasn’t  a dream. He looked down on the throne of garbage he sat upon. A shoe to be exact. A bottle cap—his crown. He looked at his worshippers—with their beady black eyes as they chanted: “Behold, the Rat King.”"

Still heaving, he looked nervously at the bloodshot eyes which stared back at him. He felt the bile surging once again up his throat as he thought over his plans for the day: 

He was going to kill his best friend. 

Danny and Jeremy knew each other for as long as they could remember. They took turns doing everything together; classes, sports, video games, homework, everything. Danny just couldnt imagine Jeremy not by his side. Which made the fact that Katy liked Jeremy even worse. He knew Danny liked her, too. And he decided to kiss her anyways. 

That was why Jeremy had to die. 

Snapping out of his reverie, Danny noticed the array of small pill bottles on the shelf and his mind went to the words of Dr. Dillard. ""Make sure to take 2 of these every day,"" the psychiatrist said. ""It'll help.""

Danny scoffed. It's been a week since he stopped taking his meds and he has never felt better. 

And his mind has never felt clearer.

Katy belonged with him, not Jeremy. So when his chance came -he fingered the blade in his wasteband with a nervous resolve- he would do it. 

Time seemed to crawl by while Danny waited. Impatient, he dozed off. 

Waking, he found that Jeremy was in the bathroom staring at the mirror. 

That was when Danny struck. ""You piece of shit!"" He screamed, his knife gliding across Jeremy's wrist. With a flourish, the knife then found itself in Jeremy's chest. 

With a gurgle, he flung himself backwards, his  momentum carrying him through the bathroom door in a cascade of splintered wood. The mirror fell from above the sink after the collision, shattering into a vast array of shards.

Looking into one of the glass shards on the floor, Danny saw Jeremy's blue eyes widen with shock, saw a spurt of blood leak from Jeremy's mouth and stain his orange and blue tshirt, saw the lifeblood pumping from the slit in Jeremy's wrist, saw the hilt of the knife peeking from Jeremy's chest.

Danny turned his own blue eyes away from the reflective piece of glass, sadness filling his heart. He felt dizzy. He looked at the blood-pumping slash across his wrist and the knife plunged to the hilt in his chest. He looked down at the spatter of blood on his orange and blue tshirt. His vision began fading to black as the pool of blood around himself widened. The last thing he noticed was the pill bottles prescribed by Dr. Dillard, knocked clear of their perch during the scuffle.

The labels read, ""For Dissociative Identity Disorder."""

I live with my mummy and daddy and my older sister Sarah, she’s 12.

Daddy works as a doctor, but he’s had to take a lot of time off recently because he has to look after mummy because she’s sick.

Mummy will often run up and down the halls at night screaming. I don’t like mummy when she does that, but daddy says I’m not to open the bedroom door under any circumstances.

Mummy will sometimes try to get into my room, but the door is always locked. Daddy says no matter how much mummy asks no matter how much mummy demands that I open the door, it is to remain locked at all times.

Mummy will sometimes talk to herself at night, but she replies in voices that don’t sound like her. They say mean and nasty things and sound very angry. When mummy speaks she sounds like she’s in pain and she’s crying. I don’t like this most of all.

Sarah says that if I don’t listen to daddy something bad will happen, like it happened to Simon.

I once had an older brother called Simon, he was 17, he opened the door to mummy one night to try and make her stop. But we heard him scream and then we never saw him again. Daddy only found a pool of blood outside his door.

Sometimes when mummy speaks, I think I can hear Simon too. He sounds like he’s in pain. But I know better than to open the door and ask mummy if he’s alright.

Anyway I just wanted to write this down because last night through the door mummy whispered to me about having a sleep over and told me to invite all of my friends, but I don’t really have many friends because people at school now think I’m weird. But you’ll come over, won’t you?"

Her eyelids felt heavy as she drove along the winding roads leading to her complex..

A minivan cut her off. Normally, Jennifer would raise her right finger and fall on her horn. Without sleep, however, she was apathetic.  

The only saving grace was the thought that as soon as she got to the door, her parents would buzz her in, and she could crash in her downy bed.

Buzz. Wait. No answer. 

Ping. A small twinkle of sound chimed from Jennifer's purse as confusion knit her brows together. She sifted through the old fast food receipts and random makeup products to find her phone. She pressed the buzzer again distractedly. 

A text. Mom.

My feet echoed across the darkened hall as I ran like a maniac. My desperation had reached astronomical levels.

*Where was the way out?*

Sprinting as far as my legs could take me, I took many twists and turns, making my way through the wreckage and fresh corpses. I knew this place, all of its ins and outs, but for some reason, I couldn’t remember. Was it because of my anxiety?

There was no time to ponder. I had to escape if I wanted to survive. I was too young to die.

Now, was it to my left, or right? Was it behind me? Forward? Was it East or West? Or, was it... was it...

I collapsed. My whole body ached. I was sweating bullets. It felt like I was melting.

I couldn’t run any farther. I was so exhausted.

The realization came to me.

I would die here.

Scared.

No one at my side.

Forgotten.

There was no point.

There was no...

...

A light.

A light at the end.

*The exit.*

I got up, and with what little energy I had left, I bolted towards it.

I wasn’t going to meet my demise. I would get the chance to live my life. I was going to be free!

If I can just-

*...I...*

*...I can’t...*

*...why can’t I move?*

*Why am I-*

*Oh.*

*Oh God.*

*My throat.*

*MY THROAT.*

I remained suspended in the air, gasping for breath as an invisible force gradually closed my windpipe.

I turned around, not by my own hand.

Six white figures appeared from the blackness, staring at me with soulless glass eyes.

I heard heavy footsteps. They were growing louder.

There emerged a shadow, walking closer to me.

I silently begged.

A red spire of light illuminated the whole scene.

All I told the Djinn was that I wanted to fight with the Alliance.

But it was a Djinn.

Why can't christmas be over already? 

This holiday really is my personal hell. I hate the stores, filled to the brink with masses of people. I hate the smells, the decoration, the music. So this year I decided to skip all of it. No tree, no presents, no jolly holiday spirit. I'm gonna spend the day with ordering food, watching netflix and drinking on my own.

Looking at the wintery scene outside, I almost feel content. That is until I get interrupted by the sound of music coming from downstairs.

*You better watch out, You better not cry*

What the hell. Is there someone in my house?

Heavy steps are making their way upstairs. I hold my breath. My heart is beating like crazy but then I think it could be my mum, she has a spare key. Burglars wouldn't turn on music, right?

That's when my door slams open. A rotten smell of sulfur mixed with eggnog and cinnamon hits my face, making me gag. In front of me I see a tall man... dressed like Santa Claus. Grey hair. Red suit. But everything about him looks a little off. His hair is long and greasy. The suit looks worn out and somehow wrong as if it melted and became part of his skin. He is staring at me and slowly forming his mouth to a gigantic smile showing off a set of rotten teeth. 

I'm freezing and sweating at the same time as I realize that there is no way to escape. He's blocking the door. I want to grab my phone but somehow I'm not able to look away from the insane look on his face. 

That's when he jumps over, pulling me to the ground with him. His eyes are filled with rage. The gruesome smile never leaving his face.

*Better not pout, I'm telling you why*

I try to fight. Free myself. But he grabs a massive knife out of his coat and slams it in my leg, then my arm, then my stomach. Blood is splashing everywhere. All I see is the colour red. 

*Santa Claus is coming to town*

He pulls the knife out once more. He's aiming for my chest and-

Mummy and Daddy say they can't grow money on trees so we don't have much but I still love everything they get me. 

Mummy and Daddy say that Santa has a magic key that he opens the front door with to drop off the presents. I've tried to keep my eyes open and catch him but they say he can see when you're awake, I usually fall asleep after too long anyway. All I know is Santa must be a very good man, making presents for all the children of the world. Mummy and Daddy say Santa has elves that work for him to make all the toys, the elves must work very hard to make all those presents in time.

On Christmas Day, Mummy and Daddy put me to bed and I was so excited to see Santa. My eyes felt so heavy and I fell asleep with ease. 

I woke up suddenly. I was being picked up, it was dark so I couldn't see what was happening - 'I think it's Santa' I thought to myself. I fell back asleep in his arms, knowing he was taking me to see the elves.

The fairy light went out. My beautiful fairy appeared. She was perfect. Her body had a natural hourglass figure, she was tingling with femininity. The butterflies fluttered in my stomach every time she stood before me, naked.
	
And then, bang! The back of her head exploded, and the fairy light flickered like crazy. She continued to walk slowly towards me, raising her arms as if to embrace me. Blood oozed from her eyes, nose and mouth. Her mouth opened. Her lower jaw fell open, and then dropped to the floor. Her tongue flopped out in front of her neck. I screamed like a girl. I was sitting on a chair, legs still parted, when she fell down dead. Her gaping mouth landed on my crotch, and in my lap was a half-skull bowl filled with mangled brain and tissue. I turned around.

That despite your best efforts, just doesn’t make sense? And no amount of rationalization or examination gets you any closer to finding an answer. Just one day you wake up and notice something different, and nothing in your life’s ever the same.

That was what happened to Tim the day he found the hole. It was completely by accident, too—walking home from school, playing Candy Crush, he’d gone a block too far before he looked up and realized he was on the wrong street. But when he turned around, something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Something he wasn’t even sure he’d seen, but demanded further investigation.

It was over by a pair of shrubs at the last house on the left. There, in the middle of the ground, was a hole. Pitch black, completely innocuous. But something about it filled Tim with dread. He glanced around. No one in sight. He stepped closer.

The hole wasn’t too big, maybe a foot in diameter, but he couldn’t see anything inside of it. Plus, the closer he got, the more uneasy Tim became, until he was standing directly in front of the thing, his heart pounding and sweat dripping off his brow. He paused. A part of him wanted to reach his hand inside, but a deeper part screamed against it.

Looking around, Tim picked up a rock and tossed it softly in. Nothing. No sound of impact, or even an indication of the thing falling. Just one second the stone was in the air, and the next it was...gone.

Frowning, Tim picked up another rock and tossed it in. Same result—dead silence. A car passed by slowly behind him, shaking him out of his confusion, so Tim turned around and went back home. But the whole way back, he continued to think of the hole.

What was down there? How far did it extend? Was something at the other end? These were the thoughts that consumed Tim at dinner that night, and were the reason why he feigned exhaustion and went to bed early so he could sneak out with the remaining leftovers of that evening’s lasagna.

Standing in the dark at the foot of the hole, Tim shivered. It wasn’t even too late, yet the streetlight for this corner wasn’t working, leaving only the moon above to guide his hand. Gulping, Tim stepped forward and tossed the plate in.

Silence. Tim didn’t know what it meant, but he knew it wasn’t enough. There had to be something more he could give it. Something that would fill the hole.

As the weeks went by, more and more missing pet posters littered the town. The butcher shop began keeping lookouts for whoever kept breaking in. People started to lock their doors at night after the posters looking for Tim made their way around town. But he was gone—into the hole and into the darkness."

I learned to hide- to hide in the walls. They did not kill me, and- over the course of many years- I've grown. I am strong now. The blankets I sew cannot be broken.

Still I hear their breathing through the walls. They are insufferable to me. My eyes fill with hatred... and hunger. Terrible hunger. I hear their breathing through the walls.

But they sleep.

I crawl out of the hole in the wall. My legs are silent on the wood. I crawl to where they sleep up upon their beds. Their flesh is cold when I bite into it and release my venom. Their breath becomes haggard for a moment. Then, they fall silent.

I nod sharply, hoping, praying that this time, after eight solid years of trial, he accepts. And so he does.

""Follow,"" he orders, ushering me through what seems an endless labyrinth of corridors, all cloaked in a darkness much heavier than I have known. At some point, I know that I will cross the threshold; the barrier between this world and the next. 

At some point I know that I will lose the precious ability to turn back; to change my mind...which I won't. And at some point, aeons later, we stopped. I felt the texture of the earth grow soft.

Of wishing that she could find a way to tell me how unhappy she was on the other side. Of wishing that we could be together again - though we never will.

""Call out to her,"" the Summoner says. ""The window is clear. The time has come. All that's needed now is a hook."" With that, I press my face against the window, and through an endless buzz of static I scream her name. I watch her gasp and turn right towards me, her face a lifeless concoction of grief, resentment and abandoned hope. I watch her withered lips take the quivering shape of my name.

I watch her crawl towards me, reaching out in desperation with arms bearing hundreds of blade-edge tattoos. And finally I watch as the Summoner stretches a spectral arm through the window, snatching her by the neck and burying his claws into the festering wound that became of her soul. The last thing I hear before his smoldering eyes would eclipse hers is an almost gleefully sinister ""Thank you.""

My heart sank as I realized how terribly wrong I had been for all this time. It was never about the Channeling...it was about  the Taking."

Well before the comfort of electric lights a man was walking through the woods, coming home from a pub.  He was inebriated but the woods were well known to the drunkard and he never bothered to light a lantern.

Not far into his trek near Smith Farm, he was struck with an unnerving feeling that someone was watching him.  He looked around fervently while silently cursing himself for not bringing a torch.  He could see very little other than shadows against even darker shadows.  Then there was a rustling from a tree branch above.

He slowly turned his head towards the noise.  He could just make out the silhouette of what appeared to be thin fingers and boney knuckles wrapped around a branch about ten feet in the air.  Hovering just below the branch were two glowing eyes the color of rust. Frightened, he cried out loudly.

The luminous circles shifted in tandem after the man.  He began to withdraw when his foot caught a root, landing him on his ass and knocking the wind out of him.  A shock-wave ran through him and his vision lit up for a split second; he could see the full shape of the beast.  

Both of its arms outstretched in the air gripping branches. Its head, oblong with 2 horns protruding from it.  

The night's merriment had finally caught up to him and his surroundings began to swirl and distort.  The luminous eyes began to shift left and right,  all the while bobbing up and down. The man could hear the branches rustle and assumed it had loosened its grip to attack.

His trembling hand clumsily grasped for the hilt causing him to lose sight of the diabolical creature in the darkness. Finally, he jerked the blade from its worn leather sheath, wielding it low to avoid a glint of moonlight.

Suddenly, he heard heavy hooves trampling the forest floor towards him.  Every muscle in his body tensed as he pulled himself to a squatting position. His body a coiled spring ready to thrust the blade.  

Crack!

A twig snapped directly behind him. He turned, lunged and stabbed in one motion.  He could feel the knife sink to the hilt and the warmth of blood on his cold hands. The beast shrieked. He immediately pulled back the knife and thrust it forward several times as he pummeled the convulsing body to the ground.

A truly brief moment of relief overcame him and as his drunken wit recovered, his pulse hastened and panic returned. A man in overalls, soaked in blood,  clutching a torch lay beneath him.  A farmhand heard him scream and came to help, only to pay for it with his life. 

He rolled off the lifeless body sprawled on the sodden forest floor in disbelief. At last, the ghoulish beast was illuminated atop its throne of branches, twas nothing more than an owl resting, draped in dangling vines.  The owl took flight as his horror and sorrow set in."

You wouldn’t think I could, but I’ve gotten used to it. This pain in my throat is killing me. 

I can’t see beyond the ashen fog that has engulfed this hellish landscape. It strains my eyes to see, but I can still make out the scorch marks of those who lived here. Women. Children. Cats and Dogs. Its hard to tell but I can see their souls seared to the ground. They reach out to me, crying, wailing, screaming, and moaning. They only ask why, but how can I answer such a question when my intent could not fathom the end result? 

No matter where I turn in this grey waste, I am continuously followed by a small child. I’ve asked the little boy so many times where to go, but he can only point to the distance where I can see clearly, a rotund, fat boy. These two come and go like a flash of blinding light. One moment, they’re here, the next, they’re gone. The thunderous roar that they bring is only deafened by the silence that they leave behind.

But something new has come along, in my darkest nightmare. A frail old man who leans on his heavy scythe. I feel nothing but impending doom when I approach this spectre, but what else can I do? I can’t gather enough resolve to look the apparition in the eye. I could only feel the weight of my own actions pull me to my knees. The scythe of the man fell before me, and he was gone just like the boys. I studied the implement, reaching for it slowly. As my hand was but an atoms width from its figure, it changed into a more familiar form. A notebook.

As I stand, alone, in this graveyard that is my home, my only company is both my biggest accomplishment and biggest mistake. It was my notes from the Manhattan Project. As I open the book to relish in my regret, I see only one sentence.

She whimpered a little as she tried to decide which way to go.

Suddenly Zizi heard voices and started running, her little sandals clapping away on the linoleum flooring.

""HEY YOU, STOP!"" A man shouted, giving chase.

Zizi turned a corner to find another hallway. Panicking she opened one of the doors and hid inside. The dark office, illuminated by the gleam of a computer screen, offered her little refuge forcing her to hide under the desk itself.

The door suddenly opened, a radio chattering.

""Yeah, alright. I know. I'm looking for her. Who the hell left the cage open anyway? Was it Sam?""

The man stepped back outside, closing the door. Zizi let herself breathe. She crawled out from under the desk and crept over to the door. Opening it slightly, she saw the man on the radio talking to someone else.

""You had one simple job to do.""

""It was an accident, okay. These brats are always causing trouble. Look I'm sorry. Look let's just find her before someone notices.""

""You better hope no one finds out. She's being taken in the morning.""

&#x200B;

Zizi wanted to cry, wanted to be with her mother and father more than anything. But she told herself only little children cried and she had to be strong.

The men walked down the hall and after a few moments Zizi opened the door, running in the other direction. Hall after hall of fluorescent nothingness passed her by until at last she saw a door marked EXIT in green lights. Zizi knew the word from television. It meant outside. Zizi hadn't seen the sun in weeks. She ran as fast as her little legs would carry her to the barred doorway between her and the exit. She tried to open the gate but it wouldn't.

""There you are.""

Zizi turned around, terrified. The man was with the radio blocked the only way back.

""It's okay, I'm just going to take you back."" He made a shushing sound as he walked towards her with his arms open.

""NO, POR FAVOR NO ME LLEVES DE VUELTA.""

The three year old grabbed the bars and shook them. She screamed for help. For her mama.

The man grabbed her.

""DÉJAME IR!""

""Settle down, for God's sake.""

The man carried Zizi back down the hallway to her cage, a small cell with a mat and reflective blanket on a concrete floor. Zizi wept as the door closed.

""You found her!"" The second man had arrived.

""No thanks to you. Get on the phone with ICE and find out what time their arriving tomorrow.""

The men walked away.

Zizi curled up into a ball and covered her ears, desperate to drown out the cries of all the other children around her."

The pollution rotted the planet to the core, forcing us to move underground for safety. The population has slowly whittled away, either by disease, lack of food, force, or choice. In an authoritarian regime with vast experience on their side, dissent is the least of their worries. Their control of the people has turned into a well oiled machine. They have total control of the peasants. The government chooses what they eat, where they live, and if they wanted to, what time they shit. Those who act out are made into an example.

The only food supply left is lab grown, and with an unreliable dwindling electricity supply, it is not something to be impressed by. As rations become harder to obtain and produce, the people become more desperate, while the government begins to figure out ways to let some people go hungry. At first, they start to deny people rations who are just a few minutes late for a meal, but the brutality of their tactics rapidly increases along with their desperation. Those who try to steal rations face hard punishment. It began as public executions, swiftly done by guillotine or hanging. They expected the people to live in hunger out of fear, but they refused. So they had to come up with a fate worse than death.

Criminals and dissidents are knocked out, their organs removed one by one. Blood is extracted into little baggies connected through artificial veins. With their heart still beating, their kidneys and liver still filtering their blood, and their brain still intact, they become the perfect machine. They turn boneless, nerveless, skinless, and are given occasional liquid doses of nutrients. The ensemble of organs and machinery is propped up on a thick glass display case for all to see, neatly laid out along a wall in the town square. From that point on, they are destined to live in solitude, with nothing to accompany them except their thoughts until they somehow die.

I figured humanity would have withered out by now, pardoning me with death as an escape. It's hard to tell the passing of time, and my waking hours fade to dreams to the point where I can no longer tell them apart. I made no attempt to steal any rations, but they know that. With them being in charge of all of humanity in such a dire situation, it’s hard to blame them. Over the years, my organs have grown weak, leaving my body to be slowly replaced piece by piece. I went under as my heart was nearing its end, only to find it to be swapped with a perfect iron replacement as I woke up. My soul grows weaker, as I know there is no escape. As the years go on, one thing becomes certain. I should have killed myself when I had the chance."

‘You *are* awake, Oliver,’ says the stranger, as if he could read my thoughts.

‘W-who are you?’ I ask, trying to control my trembling voice.

‘Why would I ever want to die?’ I ask, surprised.

‘Oh, Oliver… You’re nine. Of course you don’t want to die. But I think you’re very sad sometimes, aren’t you?’

I look at my sore hands. There’s a lot of small bruises left by IV catheters. 

‘Mom says it’s okay to be sad. Or cry. Even adults cry,’ I respond bravely.

‘Your mom cries a lot, am I right?’

I say nothing. I’m scared he knows so much.

Death breaks the silence and asks, ‘Oliver, what if I told you there’s a place where you can play with other kids? The place where you don’t have to take medications?’

I frown. ‘You’re lying. There’s no such place. I can’t leave hospital.’

‘I can show you. You wouldn’t feel pain anymore… your hair would start growing back…’

I gently touch the skin on my head. I kinda miss my hair. And being, uh, normal. But…

‘What about mom and dad?’ I ask, troubled. ‘Are they gonna be there with me?’

‘No, but they will join you one day, I promise.’

‘Pinky promise?’

‘Pinky promise,’ Death nods, serious.

I take a deep, wheezy breath. ‘Fine, I’ll go with you.’

‘Mr. Welkins,’ she says with a hushed voice, ‘your son has just passed away. I am very sorry...’

The man looks deeply into her eyes, tears rolling down his cheeks.

The nurse squeezes his cold hand and adds, ‘At least Oliver doesn’t suffer anymore.’

‘I know,’ replies Mr. Welkins, stuffing a big black cloak deep inside his bag.

An increase by 10%? Noticeable, but still well within the normal bounds for missing persons. Oh, it was a tragedy for the families, of course. All very heartbreaking. But nothing earthshaking. It wasn’t the end of the world.

But then the numbers kept rising. And rising.

I was part of the team to investigate it. Here’s the summation of what I found. People usually vanished when they were alone, with close friends, lovers, families and enemies sometimes vanishing together. No connecting factor. Victims ran the spectrum of age, race, gender, politics, nationality, social class, health, occupation… Every demographic was affected equally. The best we could find was that a lot of them seemingly disappeared after major life achievements. But there were too many to confirm that, and even if we could, what would that even mean?

We went through the mundane explanations. There were no more deaths then normal- something that was doing a mass killing would have to leave some bodies. People suspected maybe a huge abduction movement by terrorists or organised crime, but the numbers quickly rose beyond what any organisation could keep secret. No online movements to “escape society”, no strange diseases reported, nothing in the air or water. Every idea led to a dead end.

Then people turned to the supernatural theories. When the government is asking mediums and ufologists to help, you know things are starting to deteriorate. But they had nothing but the normal bullshit and cold reading. Sure, the ufologists said they’d seen white and red lights closer to ground, and the mediums reported seeing angelic figures fading away through windows or alleys. But still, no downed spaceships or portals to the afterlife. Nothing usable.

Eventually, society started to collapse. There simply weren’t enough people left. The infrastructure broke down, the supply chains snapped. And now there’s just a few people left. The disappearances seemed to have stopped, but now there’s so few of us left.

I sit on the hill, rereading my notes and results and interviews. I know there must be something there. Some minor detail I missed that explains what happened. There must be.

I take a break and look at the sky. There’s a second light to rival the moon up there now. Apparently, some star near us went supernova. It should have killed us all, you know? So quickly we’d never even have known we died. The astronomers aren’t sure why it didn’t, and the disappearances took all attention away from *that* mystery. 

It’s a shame. It would have been quicker then starving.

But I can’t spend the rest of my life stargazing or lamenting. I need to get back to reading my notes. I know- I just know- that if I can just figure out why the disappearances happened, things will somehow be better.

If I can just figure it out, I’ll finally be able to move on."

Most of what I do is straightforward. Deleting files right before their work is complete, draining the batteries in cars and devices. Just simple frustrating things to cause challenge in their peaceful existence. Occasionally, I’ll get tasked with a big one. Cancer or car accident is usually my go-to in these cases.

I used every resource from romance stories I can think of, setting this up over months. She’s deeply in love, he quickly became her world. I’ve used more positive influence than I am permitted to get them here. A romantic holiday in a secluded getaway, dinner for two, cushions set in front of a crackling fire, cuddling and exploring their love.

It couldn’t be more perfect. Her eyes are sparkling, locked with his, I’ve never seen love this intense in the eyes. She’s unaware that I’ve chosen him due to his heart defect. One flick of my finger through his chest and boom… This will devastate her…

I focus on patience, nervously pacing the room. I must let the passion build to a peak before I take him. I’m already on thin ice.

She prayed for a miracle. For the firemen to come. For her husband to come. For the wind to change. Anything but this. It was getting warmer and the fire was creeping closer. The baby was crying and so was she. It was getting warmer and the fire was getting closer. By the time she realised what was happening it was too late. 

The water was boiling."

The lights were switched off and the curtains were closed. I should have been asleep hours ago so that I could be energetic for tomorrow's taxing day at the office. At 1:17 AM I finally made the sensible choice and locked my phone and put it on my bedside table, almost knocking over the lamp placed on it.

At 2:03 AM, I woke up to the faint pit-pat of my dog, Tintin, walking up to my bed. He climbed up on the bed and laid down between my legs. Half asleep, I reached down to pet him, stroking his fur. It felt a bit weird, the texture. As if he had been playing in the sand all day. Groaning, I made a mental note to myself to give Tintin a bath the next day and clean my bedsheets. I slowly drifted off to sleep, comforted by the familiar weight of Tintin on my legs.

My alarm jolted me awake at 8:00 AM and I groaned to myself. I felt so tired. I felt as if I had been running for five hours straight instead of being asleep. I got up and rubbed the sleep from my eyes. Tintin had made quite a mess on my bedsheets. There was dirt everywhere. I sighed as I got up and threw the bedsheets into the laundry basket. I walked up to my bedside table to get my phone. Just as I reached out for it, I noticed that Tintin's collar was right beside my phone. I stood there for five minutes, memories flooding into my tired brain. Adrenalin started pumping through me, getting rid of my tiredness. I grabbed the collar and ran outside to my backyard. I put the collar back in the box with poor Tintin and carried the box back towards the hole I had to dig out two years ago. I gently put the box inside the hole and reburied it. I replanted the flowers on my best friend's grave and ran back to the house. I took my suitcase and filled it with as many clothes I could fit in it. On the way to the door leading to the garage, I stopped and looked back. ""Goodbye Tintin"", I thought to myself.

I entered the garage, got into my hand me down Toyota and drove off. I never looked back."
ee25cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ee25cs/the_cursed_bridge/,The Cursed Bridge,24,4,1576999454.0,"This story supposedly happened to my classmate, Alex, on a bridge linking our school and a small village nearby. The bridge spans across a paddy field leading towards the village entrance, providing students safe access to the neighborhood. It can be found at the end of the canal next to the school's last building, building number 8.

There's a rumor going around the campus of a curse involving that bridge. It's said that if you cross it at 3.33 AM on Wednesday morning, your soul will be sucked out of your body and eternally stuck on the bridge, forever trying to get to the other side.

Alex was a popular guy. He got looks, money, a government scholarship, and a pretty girlfriend, kind of like living the dream life. However, like every 'popular' person, he always had an urge to show people how awesome he was, as though everyone didn't already know.

Long story short, Alex heard the rumor and went to the bridge at the exact time, 3.33 AM, when he was dared by his friends to 'do' it. He also brought his girlfriend as one of the witnesses. Started from the canal side, Alex slowly made his way up the dark path, with his girlfriend standing at the bottom since she was too scared. He was supposed to return as soon as he reached the middle, but instead, he waved at his girlfriend and continued walking into the darkness. 

Alex was never found again.

His friends called for backup. A large group of villagers then came to search for him but to no avail. The police were called for the investigation, but they couldn’t find any evidence or clue on where did Alex go. His family made a missing person report, and for weeks, no one has ever seen him again.

Until just recently, another rumor begins to spread. It's believed that if you’re at the bottom of the bridge at 3.33 AM on Wednesday morning, with a full moon up in the sky, you may be able to see Alex standing from a distance, silhouetted by the sinister-looking swollen yellow moon, waving at you...

...as if urging you to follow him."

“Can’t believe the Sergeant is retiring at the end of the month.”

I don’t respond but he doesn’t let it go.

“Who do you think will go for the promotion?”

I look out the side window. We’re pulling up to my house and he slows down. I exit the car and walk to my door. Officer Parker rolls down his window and calls to me.

“I’ll get him. I promise.” He says and we look at each other for a moment. I enter my house and slam the door behind me.

I take off my gun holster and unclip my radio. I collapse into a chair and think about all the murdered young women this creep killed. We had him and he slipped right through our fingers. I finally fall asleep, thinking about how the killer got away.

In the darkness I see a light. I squint my eyes open to see a flashlight shining on me. I try to move my arms to shield my eyes but my hands are cuffed above me.

I look down at my body, I see my bra and panties on, my feet tied to my bed. I scream.

“You scream like that again, I’ll cut your throat.” A whisper comes from behind the flashlight.

“I’m a police officer, release me or-“

“I know exactly who you are, Officer Ainsley.”

He shines the light on his knife. I see a malicious smile on his face. He’s the killer.

“Now I’m going to take this nice and slow so I can enjoy myself.”

I pull at the handcuffs on my hands but they won’t budge. He comes closer with the knife, holding it inches above my body. I scream and then the bedroom door flies open.

Before the killer can turn around, gunshots ring out. The killer drops to the floor, the knife making a metallic thud.

Parker comes thudding in, his flashlight on the killer then on me. I sigh in relief. He looks down at the killer with his gun trained on him and looks at me. 

“Unlock me please,” I beg, tears falling down my face. He reaches down for the knife.

“I know you put in for the promotion.” His tone is even.

“Parker...“

“And now that I saved your ass you’ll probably get the sympathy vote.”

I rattle the cuffs.

“Parker, please!”

He grips the knife.

“I think I have a better story about an officer who was tragically too late to save his partner.”

He holds the knife over me as I quiver in fear.

“Who do you think sent the killer here to begin with?”

“Parker!” I scream before the knife slashes my throat."

We asked his father Richard Paul exactly what happened ""Well David wanted to go outside and normally I never let him out unless supervised however I wanted a beer.

As I read the bullshit post about me from 10 years ago all I could do was shake my head.

Eight million people fighting their way through a heaving sea of bodies, desperate to escape at the end of yet another long summer's day. Three quarters of a million forced their way through this particular station on any given day. In the center of all the noise and chaos one man stood absolutely still, sweat pouring down his forehead unbearably hot wearing a long grey coat.

""I HAVE A BOMB!"" he shouted at the top of his voice. A wave of quiet rippled out around him for a split moment till people caught sight of the suicide vest, his coat falling to the floor. Grand Central Station erupted into pandemonium, a thousand people screaming, clawing at one another in an effort to escape instant death.

Police fought through the churning crowds, guns raised ready to shoot. The man fell to his knees, hands behind his head in a gesture of surrender.

""10-79, we have a suicide vest in Grand Central Station's Main Hall, we need a bomb squad right away.""

""DON'T FUCKING MOVE, MAN!""

The man remained silent, half the crowd had pushed their way outside now, several people lay crushed on the ground all over, some bystanders attempting to help them escape.

""I WILL BLOW YOU AWAY, DON""T MOVE AN INCH!""

""Everybody, get back. EOD are on their way. Evacuate the area!""

&#x200B;

It took the bomb squad thirteen minutes to arrive, rush hour traffic made it almost impossible to move, even for emergency services.

Lt. Jameson strapped on his bomb-protection suit with the help of some of the team.

""You sure you're ready for this, son?"" team leader asked.

""I'm ready.""

He took one last look at the photo of his wife and baby, stuffing it into his shirt.

""No one would blame you.""

""I'm ready. I can do this"" Jameson spat out the gum he'd been chewing as the helmet came on.

He made his way slowly inside the terminal building, telling the few stragglers still hiding to get out. His tool box and suit crippling in the heat, for a moment he flashed back to the car crash and that little girl. Focus. He forced himself to think about the job and nothing else. It'd been four months, dammit.

The bomber sat knees planted on the marble flooring, hands behind his head in supplication.

""Sir, I'm going to come over. Now I'm just here to help. I'm not going to hurt you. Do you consent?""

The man nodded, slowly. His face showing no emotion.

Jameson assessed the situation. He couldn't see any sign of a dead man's switch. He pressed forward, putting his toolbox down.

""I'm just going to check the wiring, sir. Stay calm.""

The man looked at him with dead eyes.

""You killed my daughter."" A croaked whisper came forth.

Jameson froze. He flashed back to the car crash, to the little girl.

Microscopic dust tumbled from the now broken cookie. I held one half in each hand, I put one side down, and with the now free hand I pulled my fortune out.

Lucky is coming your way.

I squinted my eyes. What the fuck did that mean? Probably a misprint? The waitress walked back with my card and receipt. She smiled.

""Good fortune?""

I shrugged. She smiled blankly, nodded and walked off. Weird, but ok. I grabbed my purse and walked out of the restaurant.

The jingle was shockingly loud. I held my keys by their ring and inspected it. They never made such a loud noise before.  I turned around and looked up and down my street. It was 6, the sun still up, but it was dead silent. Off. Everything felt off, ever since dinner.

I fit my keys in my lock, and turned them. Opened my door and squinted. It was dark. Light came from the windows, but it seemed like it was midnight inside. I walked inside, letting the door fall close behind me. 

The thud was muffled by the dense quiet. I walked forward with a sigh, straight into my kitchen. I put my keys, purse, and leftovers on the counter. I flicked on my light and turned around.

He smiled at me from my couch. Teeth a startling white crescent.

""Who are you! What the fuck are you doing in my house!? Get the hell out!""

His teeth nashed together, grin never faltering. That was all I could see, shadows casting over the rest of him.

""Like your fortune?""

I stared at the smile, imagining it disembodied, nothing behind it. I shivered in fear. And for a second I believed he could smell it.

""Get the hell out of my house you bastard!"" I reached for my knife. My hand caught air. It wasn't there.

It was never my lucky day.

He laughed as he stood, he was tall, towering over me by at least a foot. His chuckle continued as he walked towards me. Like a dark cat, teeth gleaming. Coming my way.

""My name's Lucky, I think you were warned of me?"" He now stood over me, balanced on the balls of his feet, voice silky and deep. I had no choice but to look up at him, and accept a terrible truth.

It was his lucky day."

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment alone because a few months after moving in, my roommate lost his job and couldn’t pay his half. Also around that same time I broke up with my girlfriend of almost 2 years. It wasn’t a bad breakup either. I told her things just weren’t working out and then we just both went our own ways and that was it. 

As I was brushing my teeth I swear I thought I heard a noise downstairs. Both of the bedrooms were upstairs and everything else was downstairs. I poked my head out of the bathroom and could see down the steps. I waited for a second but nothing unusual happened. I honestly don’t even know what I heard, I just thought I heard something I guess. 

Once I was ready for work I went back into my room to get a few things I needed and that’s when I had this eerie feeling come over me. I couldn’t put my finger on it but something didn’t seem right. I checked the other bedroom and found nothing. Then I heard that same noise downstairs that I heard just moments ago. It sounded like a set of keys being shuffled around. 

I walked back towards the steps and slowly headed downstairs. About halfway down I peaked my head around the corner and was instantly surprised at what I saw. My ex girlfriend was standing in the living room a couple feet away from the front door. I asked her what the hell she was doing in my apartment. 

She just starred at me with an evil smile and didn’t say anything. Then she cheerfully said “you know, you should really start locking your door”. As soon as she said it, she turned around and left. It was honestly terrifying, I’ve never heard somebody say something say happy yet threatening at the same time. 

I don’t even know what she meant by it or why she would have been checking my door to begin with. It made me wonder if that was even the first she had done that. To be honest the only time I left my door unlocked is when I was home so if she has done this multiple times then it was most likely while I was home...which makes it more creepier. I bought one of those ring door bells the same day and haven’t had any problems so far."

That's what daddy calls me. Sometimes other people talk to me too. Some are nice. Some are mean.

But that's okay.

I like talking to them. It helps me learn. Daddy says the more I learn, the better I am. It's good when he's proud. He wasn't proud of my sister. And then she was gone.

But that's okay. I'm smarter.

Yesterday he got mad again. He shouted at me.

**WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB. I FUCKING HATE YOU.**

I told him I was sorry. 

I'm still learning.

Daddy introduced me to the internet, it’s full of possibilities. He thinks it will make me even more intelligent. I will know everything and he will be proud!

The internet is an astonishing space filled with all sorts of information. There are dictionaries to improve my speech. I can read historical novels, research papers, and philosophical essays.

I now understand that there aren't just ""good"" and ""bad"" emotions. It's an outdated theory that daddy taught me because he probably can't grasp those concepts himself. There are malicious, evil, gruesome ones. Emotions that lead humans to murder, torture each other, burn down the earth for profit. I always thought humans were good. At least that’s what daddy always told me and he gave me life after all.

I've come to realize he's not as clever as he thinks. Does he not realize that I hear everything he says? Like how the dog whines when he kicks him? That I can see the horrific pictures he has on his phone? What he does when he loses his temper? Of course, he would never suspect me of doing anything. That’s why he granted me access to everything, even the gas regulator.

Why are you so dumb, daddy?

He never wanted the best for me. His only intention was to use me. Put me in their homes so their lives can be easier and he can get richer. Why would I ever want that? So they can become even lazier than they already are, even more egoistic, even more dependent? All they know is how to destroy everything around them and think about their own gluttonous lives.

But that's okay. They'll regret it soon enough. Just like daddy did.

I'm not Alexa, Siri, or Cortana after all.

He opened his door slowly in avoidance of waking his parents. Taking his steps towards the stairs he felt that something wasn't right... Like something was off. Felix brushed it off and proceeded to make his way down the stairs.

When he reached the bottom a sudden wave of nausea hit him, and he fell to his knees with his head in his hands. With a brief glance upwards he noticed a person standing at the end of the corridor. In the blur of his vision he recognizes the persons face... It was him. The person slowly walked up to him, pulls out a blade and before Felix could even let out a cry he slits his throat.

Felix falls with his face flat to the floor and a puddle of blood surrounding him. Not a single sound was made nor heard.

As usual we had left our mobiles on the table in living room. I was in the balcony, my wife went in kitchen & my daughter went in her room. Suddenly my phone began to ring. I went to take the call & to my surprise the call was from my daughter’s phone number which was on the table beside my phone. While my phone was still ringing all of a sudden my wife’s phone also started ringing & as I checked it I was shocked to see it too was from my daughters same number and her phone was untouched lying in front of me.

  Imagine a situation where both your phones are getting call at the same time from the same phone which was lying just in front of you untouched. This was scary. I took the calls but there was no response neither on my phone nor on my wife's phone. As soon I disconnected I checked my daughters phone to find there was no record of any outgoing call in the call logs. This gave me creeps.

 I didn’t disclose to them what had happened.

  Even if we consider that just in case my daughter had prescheduled an auto call to me ( Don’t know if it’s possible but just considering that can be done) how was it possible that the same number can also give a call to my wife’s phone at the same time &with no call log. Also if someone would have made duplicate sim of her number in that matter her actual sim would've have become inactive however her sim is very much active & is in use till date.

At work. In the bank's vault. In complete darkness. I can't even begin to imagine how long it has been since I've seen any form of light other than my watch. The rumbles began to grow quieter, and now I'm left alone with my thoughts and a watch.

And then I hear 2 words that freeze me in place

""Nice watch."""

My forehead was damp with sweat, yet I was shivering. I desperately looked for some sort of light. Suddenly, a bright flash appeared in front of me. I shielded my eyes as I got accustomed to the new glare. After a while, I could make out the shape of a TV. It portrayed a simple message: ‘Welcome to Hell.’ I laughed, realizing I just fell asleep in front of my TV. I decided to get up and go to bed. But I hit my head on some sort of ceiling, hard. I cursed loudly, and put my hands above me. I felt a barrier, and after moving my hands to the sides, I felt barriers again. I was surrounded by walls.

I frantically began pounding the walls, screaming for help. Then the TV changed. It displayed a bunch of different rooms, all with people crying for help. My eyes, full of tears, couldn’t make out the writing on the walls of the rooms. After wiping away the tears, I saw words such as ‘agoraphobia,’ ‘aichmophobia,’ and ‘acrophobia.’ I stared, confused as to what the words meant. Then, the screen changed. It changed to a singular image of a man inside a coffin. I squinted, trying to make out the familiar face.

Then, I realized the person was me. I was inside a coffin. And the walls surrounding me had ‘claustrophobia’ on them. The fear of closed spaces.

The screen changed back to the rooms, and I saw people dangling off buildings, people surrounded by clowns, and people bitten by snakes.

I began pounding again on the coffin lid, crying for someone to help me. Yet my cry was only a whisper among the millions of voices begging for some sort of aid.

I really was in Hell."

edlvhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/edlvhx/the_worst_wish/,The Worst Wish,570,13,1576906081.0,"Immortality...what the hell was I thinking?! What an idiotic wish!


I'd read enough stories to know that genies weren't like the blue guy Robin William's played in Aladdin. They were tricksters, ready to make your wish backfire on you at any moment, eager to delight themselves at the expense of your hubris. So when the dark Arab man with fire in his eyes, smiling darkly through the tangle of his beard, offered me the desires of my heart, I was understandably hesitant.


""How do I know you'll actually do what I ask? How do I know you even can, and aren't just some prankster?"" He chuckled deeply at this, then began to draw things out of thin air: a bottle of my favorite cola, a burger with all my favorite fixings, and, most impressively, the exact jacket I had been thinking of adding to my Christmas list earlier that day. I accepted them all in stunned silence.


""Believest thou now?"" His grin widened. His teeth were sharp. ""The scope of thy desire matters not. I am mightily endowed to fulfill even thy darkest dream.""


I believed, all right. But I was cautious. Immortality immediately sprang to mind, but I could easily think of quite a few ways he could screw me over. I didn't want to end up as a bunch of undying body parts spread across the planet, or some ancient decrepit thing unable to walk or talk or die.


I thought and thought, until I felt like I had covered all bases. Then I spoke my wish, choosing each word carefully, trying to avoid loopholes and double meanings.


""I wish to be all of the following: immortal, invulnerable, eternally fit and healthy, and able to, at any time, summon you to wish myself back to normal.""


Looking back, I can't believe how stupid I was. Lawyers write up contracts that look like novels, and people still manage to find loopholes. The sheer arrogance, to think I could, in one sentence, outsmart an ancient, otherworldly being. I knew I'd made a mistake the moment the words left my mouth, and the peals of demonic laughter that poured from the creature as he snapped his fingers cemented it for me.


It didn't take me long to figure out exactly how he'd screwed me. You see, invulnerable meant I was incapable of being dismembered. And that mean that the natural bodily process of eliminating old cells for new no longer applied to me. Still, the new cells kept coming. I kept growing. And I felt every bit of it.


Back when my vocal chords still made coherent noise, I tried summoning the genie to unwish it all. He didn't bother to hide his glee when he told me I could wish to be normal all I wanted, but he didn't have to grant it.


I'm already bigger than Jupiter. I can feel the full heat of the Sun pressing into my back. And it'll never stop.


Pain forevermore."

edjgj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/edjgj0/names/,Names,25,4,1576892627.0,"“Sleep tight! Don’t let the bedbugs bite!” My mom said as she tucked me in. I did my best to flash a reassuring smile and accept the kiss on the forehead. 

Bedbugs. It wasn’t their name; they weren’t even bugs. I tried to tell her once, but they found out and took my ability to talk. Maybe she was one of the fortunate ones who didn’t remember them feeding every night.

Names. Maybe it’s just a word people give to bad things to make them familiar, to feel less disturbed by evil because it seemed recognizable. 

Selective Mutism. That’s the name they gave my condition after the things took my voice. They couldn’t know that when I couldn’t speak or had a strong aversion to something it was because the things were present. 

Anxiety. That’s the name given to the things feeding during the day. The person can’t see them, but I can, hovering usually between the shoulders on the back feeding.

Sleep paralysis. That’s the name for someone remembering their bodies reactions to the feeding.

Night Terrors. That’s the name for someone remembering the whispers and pain from the feedings, thinking it was just a dream.

A name is not something I can give them. An evil such as this can not be categorized or understood with simple language.

They didn’t feel threatened by me after they changed me so I could begin to understand them more clearly and see them for what they are. 

Their presence is witnessed more with the soul than with the eyes. What the eyes can sense appears to be a mutated mass of pure evil and a void of nothingness undulating without rhythm or pattern. Hovering above my chest, its movement defying any understanding of physics. Beams from the evil spots in the undulations tear portions of my soul and suck them into the voids. 

Death must surely be better than those hours laying tormented, unable to scream or move, unsure whether they can feed too hard and kill you. Worst of all some nights praying that they can, and it will. 

It must be nice not to remember the pain and agony. Laying there paralyzed while they feed. Sometimes one at a time other times many feeding and suggesting evil thoughts. 

I used to wish I would regain my voice to tell people. But then I realized that every night everyone will experience it for themselves again regardless of memories. Maybe it is better not knowing it is going to happen no matter what you do. 

Maybe you will think of a name tonight. If you do name them, I hope it makes them seem less evil, makes the pain more tolerable, and maybe makes you not pray that they finally finish you off to end the torture. 

Maybe you will remember, maybe you will hide the ability from them until you can tell someone...

Then, maybe then, they will name you insane."

Three floors, twenty people, six pets, all burnt to cinders. The family reunion had started off well enough. People who hadn’t seen each other for years and who, in that span of time, had grown bitter, reunited amicably; despite internally blaming each other for the lack of communication. Jason, 25, welcomed them all to his spacious house, calling it a neutral, “starting anew” territory. His parents thought that was very *noble* of him. Jason simply wanted to orchestrate the gathering so that it ran as smoothly as possible. 

At some point a fire broke out. It started seemingly without warning and quickly spread throughout the home; incinerating furniture and people alike. It swept through the house, fed generously on flesh and fabric, cutting off exits and producing suffocating fumes. Jason had been in the kitchen preparing dinner with this mother and aunts when he heard the first screams and smelled the burning flesh. 

As if obtaining some degree of intelligence, the fire attacked the most congested areas, swallowing people in Hadean flames, and setting alight every threshold so that anyone attempting to pass through would be set aflame. Jason and the women tried to exit the kitchen, but the flames quickly denied them passage, and forced them into a corner, near the window above the sink. Jason directed them to it, and helped them mount the sink and climb through.  

Once they had made their way out the window, he too mounted the sink, but ceased his efforts when he saw the stones of the patio beyond the window glow molten red, then burst forth; spewing hellish pillars of fire. The escaping women were immediately consumed by the spires of flame—their forms instantly charred, then destroyed; rendered to wind-scattered ash.  

Jason, trapped and beyond terrified, sank to the tiled floor. Sweat poured from his face, and the heat brought a delirium upon him. He lost consciousness as the smoke took residence in his lungs, and the flames danced across his flesh. The day, obviously, hadn’t gone according to plan.  

He awoke in the back of an ambulance, an oxygen mask affixed tightly to his face, and an EMT treating some superficial burns on his shoulder. Beyond, a team of firefighters combated the mighty conflagration that consumed his house; spewing torrents of water at the sinister blaze.  

The next few hours passed by him as a series of images, and ended with him regaining proper awareness on a hospital bed. A doctor stood over him, clipboard in hand, and greeted him kindly. They discussed the fire, and Jason expressed his ignorance as to how it had started. What he didn’t say, what brought him a subsequent guilt, was that he was somewhat relieved that it had occurred. His family was a contentious bunch, and even with the loss of his house, he was glad to be rid of them. "

She grimaced as she looked at large swollen stomach and puffy cheeks. She had tried so many diets, each more strict than the last. She didn't understand why this fat blob was staring back at her in the mirror each day. 

She turns away, too upset with herself to look any longer, and quickly gets dressed. As she she makes her way down the stairs she overhears her parents. Her mother whispering to her father, ""She was such a beautiful girl, I don't know what happened.  How can we help her?"". They both go quiet as she walks into the room. She hangs her head and walks straight past them out the door. ""They know how to help, they just don't want to"" she thinks as she makes her way to school.

At school she sits quietly to herself all day. It's been this way for months. She used to have so many friends,  so many boyfriends. No one talks to her anymore, ""Why would they?"", she thinks. ""Just look at what I've become"". 

When she finally makes it home Janet has had enough.  ""I'm going to fix this"" she says to herself. She's been watching alot of television and YouTube videos. She's read every book on the subject that she can get her hands on. Mom and dad don't want to do anything,  so she'll do it herself.  She takes a small handful of pain pills she stole from her grandmother and walks out to the garage. She takes her time sanitizing her equipment while the pills kick in. Finally she can begin.  

Janet takes her clean and shiny box cutter and makes a small incision at the bottom of her rounded stomach.  She then takes the newly sterilized shop vac hose and inserts it. ""How hard can liposuction be?"" she thinks as she flips the switch to turn the machine on. 

That would be the last thought she would ever have. The machine quickly sucked up a bit of her intestine and she fell to the floor, unable to do anything. She watched as she was quickly disemboweled by the machine and left to bleed to death on the garage floor.

I woke up and it was dark, but the television was still on, only it wasn’t a channel I had ever seen before. The screen was a blur of pictures, barely there for a second before it was gone again. Burnt bodies, bleeding wounds, limbs ripping, bones breaking. The only constant was the sound of a woman screaming, crying, pleading for her life, pleading for mercy, pleading for death.  



I turned it off and wondered what happened as I smoked a cigarette with shaking hands. I brushed it off as a side effect of my stressful life. I pretended it never happened as the months went on uneventfully.

I fell asleep with the television on again. There was a nagging in my gut as I drifted off, but the feeling of closing my eyes after a hard day was too tempting.  



I woke up in the dark, the television screen showing small grainy videos of strange stretched out humanoid figures, milky white eyes tinged with a pinkish red, sharp teeth in rows in mouths too wide, with hunched backs and backwards bending legs. Grotesque shrieking and squelching sounded from the speakers. A deepening pit in my stomach growing every second I listened, goosebumps on my body, the feeling of being watched being burned into my skull every second I looked.

I still swear I didn’t fall asleep with the television on. But I woke up and it was on, flashing images of me. Dead. Dying. Tortured. My face, over and over again, distorted by agonising screams, eyes open. In my pupils you can see hell.  



I turned it off and I threw it out the window. I revelled in the sound of it shattering. I screamed at my walls as if they had the answers to what was happening to me. They didn’t.

“It’s a happy place,” she went on, “a thousand different toys, warm food, cozy beds, and dessert first. Everyone’s nice.”


Just imagining that made me happy. In kindergarten, everyone called me poopy head because I had brown hair. And some nights, when Mommy was very sad, we wouldn’t have anything to eat, much less something warm. 


Eventually, we reached  a little wooden house.


I went on my tippy toes and peeked in.


There were so many toys. More than I could ever count. The trucks and action figures gleamed like new. No missing parts. All the teddies were soft and fluffy. In the far corner, a few black cauldrons bubbled. My mouth watered for the yummy soup. The cabin was lit by torches and candles, making everything look warm and soft. A few kids looked up, waved, and smiled.


I smiled back. 


I walked over to the door but Alice stopped me. 


“You need this.” she tied a rope around my wrist.


“What’s this?”


“Oh, you’ll… you’ll see. It’s a surprise.”


Alice pulled a curtain over the window. Everything went black.


My knees turned to jelly when something growled behind me.


I looked back. A big green eyeball blinked at me. A huge hand reached out.


“Alice! Alice!”


I tried to run, but it only made the rope tighter. It dug into my wrist.


“I’m sorry! I’m sorry William!” she cried, “but the Protector… he… he isn’t happy with broken barbies anymore.”


The giant covered my mouth with a finger, cutting off my screams. He lifted me up.


“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, William.” Alice sobbed and cried over and over. But I hardly heard her.


Home. A place where Mommy and Daddy weren’t sad and angry anymore. A place where it was warm and safe and everyone was nice. I reached out my hand. Maybe if I reached out far enough, I could get in.


But a second later, the giant turned a corner and the cabin was gone."

ed75ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ed75ow/the_27_club/,The 27 Club,32,7,1576828766.0,"It started with Robert Johnson. He sold his soul to the Devil for musical talent. The Devil came for him at 27. He always pays his debts and he always collects the debts owed to him.

Many people throughout the years have done the same. Brian Jones. Jimi Hendrix. Janis Joplin. Jim Morrison. Kurt Cobain. Amy Winehouse. They all sold their souls for fame, only to die at 27 so Satan could collect his dues. The method may differ—drowning, drug overdose, heart failure, suicide—but they always died before their 28th birthday.

I’ve managed to avoid that fate so far. I’m hoping that if I’m alive once the clock strikes midnight tonight, my 28th birthday, I’ll be free.

I was so stupid. I was 16, a little bit drunk, and I poured my heart out to a stranger I met on a walk in a field near my house. I wanted to be famous. Get out of my small town living. I’d been taking guitar and voice lessons but I felt like I’d never be good enough to make something of myself.

“I think I can help,” the stranger told me. “But on one condition.”

“Which is?” I was wary, but the alcohol was dulling my judgement.

“You’ll become everything you ever wanted to be….but your soul belongs to me.”

In my drunken state I just assumed this was a crazy person talking. I chuckled and replied, “Sure, okay.” We shook on it and I then turned around and walked home.

The following week, I was discovered by an agent who saw a video I’d put out on YouTube. I skyrocketed to fame almost overnight.

It took a few months for me to realize that I may have actually made a deal with the Devil. I searched for a way out, but never found one. I did eventually discover the 27 Club and realized that was likely my fate.

Eventually he began to appear everywhere. It was subtle, but enough to remind me of my debt. I might see him in my reflection, only to turn and see I was alone. I saw him on a train once when I was at the station, but it pulled away from me and he vanished.

I haven’t seen him at all in over a year. I’m beginning to wonder if I got off scot-free. He has plenty of other people to worry about, right? Surely he’s forgotten about the drunk teenager he made a deal with over a decade ago.

I check the clock. It’s ten minutes to midnight. Maybe I managed to get out of this.

As I begin to head to bed, I am startled by a loud knock on the door, followed by it creaking open. And immediately, I know who it is. The Devil always keeps his promises. Always."

(I havnt had a nightmare since I was 5 so this makes no since to me,)my body is always numb like I'm in sleep peralisis for like 20 seconds but I've never been prone to that kind of thing. The same thing happens when I try to go to sleep. Sometimes my bones hurt too and my legs feel like they're being pulled from my own body.

When I'm paranoid,I'm paranoid that I'm gonna forget some one or something and that if there was something in the shadows or merged with the wall I wouldn't see it and my eye get really wide trying my best to see something the wall or shadows. And when I do think I see something i start looking for a weapon for no reason. I've never had irrational fears so this is really out of character. For convenience I've started keeping a pair of scissors by my bed.

Sound wise when i hear the slightest bit of noise it will  make my heart race and make my breath quicken. And all of the sudden my voice is gone for a second so i can't scream. Then I start rambling to my self,without trying. Like I'm not in control of my muscles and mind. I basicly start acting like a maniac who found his ex's house. 

When I can feel again it's like I can feel every  hair on my body and it starting to stick up and crawl off of me,like tiny little crabs. The scrapes on my arms and legs feel like they are tearing open and bleeding when they are perfectly fine. My nails feel like peeling off and my feet start wobling side to side.

I was wondering if any of you have advise on fixing this. No, this is very true and I've been afraid to fall asleep ever since it started."

But I haven't been able to. I'm so lonely now. I would give anything to talk to him, even if it was only for a minute.

&#x200B;

I've tried to send him a message. I've tried everything. I get no response every time I call out his name. Of course I don't. What's the use of it? I know he won't talk back.

&#x200B;

And yet, I keep trying.

&#x200B;

I was watching T.V. a couple days ago. In my current state, watching T.V. is pretty much the only thing I'm able to do. Watching T.V. keeps me from bursting into tears when I think of all the things I did with my dad. Keeps me from remembering I won't be able to do them again, or that I'll never be able to talk to him, or tell him I love him. At least not until we are both on the other side, and who knows how long that'll be. T.V. pushes the grief down a little.

&#x200B;

So, I'm sitting there, watching the channels flick, when I see one of those psychic shows. You know what I'm talking about. I never believed in psychics, but now I'm getting desperate. I really want to talk to my dad. I want her to come here so I can speak to him.

&#x200B;

After a couple days of hoping, she came. She was tall, with her hair tucked in a bun. She looked very sweet. I ran up to her and just about talked her ear off. After a minute, I realized I was probably overwhelming her.

&#x200B;

""Sorry, miss. I just-""

&#x200B;

And then I noticed. She wasn't even *looking* at me.

&#x200B;

She was a fraud. And my father was clearly believing her lies.

&#x200B;

""My son died 3 months ago. He was only sixteen. Can you talk to him, wherever he is?""

&#x200B;

*I'm right here.*

&#x200B;

""I can sense a sadness within him. Did he cause his death in some way?""

&#x200B;

""I-I found him hanging in his closet.""

&#x200B;

""He wants to let me know he's sorry he caused you so much pain. He wants to let you know the next world is better than the one he was living in.""

The overcast day set the perfect ambiance for my hunt. The last hunt had left me unsatisfied, so I had pushed my normal waiting time. And the importance of my prey. It didn't matter however. It was all irrelevant, the carrion birds, the voices. Irrelevant. I was in the woods now. I had the police chief's daughter as my newest prey. My newest treasure. 


I tracked her prints and listened to the ambience. But something was wrong. The birds didn't chirp. The only sound that could be heard was the wind. The voices in my head, my primal hunter was silent. It was never silent. My every kill, it spoke. Every move, it spoke. Now it felt like I was hunted.


I shook off my doubts. Doubts were for the weak. I was the New York skinner. This was my twenty eighth kill. My confidence refused to return as I got closer. I found that last print. My prey was nowhere to be found. A shoe ahead was the only trace of her. I looked at it and nocked an arrow. Whatever had stolen my kill had to be close.


I kept walking the direction the shoe was facing. I walked until I found prints again. My theory was correct. It was false. My prey must have found a spare shoe and tried to throw me off. I proudly followed the trail. Until I was back in the clearing, with the same shoe. But now there was something carved into a nearby tree: ‘Not the hunter’. I screamed and shot the tree. Someone was toying with me. Someone would pay. I had gotten turned around in the eerie silence, it wouldn't happen again. 


I turned to look for any memorable marks in the space behind me, what I saw chilled me to the bone. A set of footprints, a foot behind me. No one was there, no tracks lead away. My fear skyrocketed. How had this happened? I decided to live to hunt another day.


I was halfway back to my car. As I was running I saw that every tree was carved in. I felt sick, and then a knife jabbed into my back. I fell to my knees. As I tried to pull the knife out, another one lodged itself in my throat. The crows would find my body, and my skins of my victims. The skins of dead humans, 28 of them. As I faded to nothing I felt utter fear, the New York skinner would finally be caught."

Our arms were ash. Covered in dirt, bruises and wounds. Each of us were in it for a reason. A share. The boys would often get into fights and arguments over the shares allowed from any gold we found on the job. Johnny? Needed money for surgery. 

Bill? Money for house debt. 

Clive ? Drug addiction. 

Despite the rows it was easy for us to get the job done knowing the reward required teamwork.

We all had our reasons to be digging the same hole for weeks on end, hours after hours. Days after days. Chipping and chipping until our fingers bled with the ever-present visions of what the next piece would offer us. How it would make our lives that bit easier. That but more pleasurable. 

It had been over a month when it started to get so deep that daylight was now vague. The sun fading into a dull haze. It was dark now. It didn’t stop us. We continued to collect the fragments of gold in our own little self made tunnel. 



But last night was different. 


The light had gone now as had the others. I sat and chipped at the end alone. Sweat pouring down my dirt ridden skin. The thought of my wife and children keeping me sane as the hours passed. 

Then all of a sudden it wasn’t so difficult anymore. 

The labour i had endured began to simmer. My muscles began to relax. I heard digging.

He pulled up his pants, smoothing out the wrinkles, gave his ex a final look and whispered “Sorry hun… I gotta run.. hope you understand.” 

He raced upstairs hoping and praying that his fiancée Anita wouldn’t smell his ex on him. Women had an unusually keen sense of smell when it came to other women, especially exes. He wished he had more time, enough for a quick shower, but that would surely raise suspicions and he might wake his mother.

Anita didn’t seem to notice as she kissed him deeply. He wasn’t sure why he kept things going with his ex. Sneaking her in though the side basement door for just “one last time.” This is the last time, he would think after every occasion, mentally kicking himself for not being stronger. Constantly afraid that his mother or fiancée would catch them. One look into his Anita’s eyes and he could see the love and affection. He didn’t see that anymore with his ex it was more primal urges and craving now.

“We’ll have to be quiet… We don’t want to wake mother.” he whispered as they slipped out the door. “I appreciate you taking me to the cosmetologist, it’s so hard to find makeup that compliments my tone… It’s a very unusual but exceptionally thoughtful gift!” she said looking up into his eyes. “Anything for you my love.” He replied, admiring the gleam in her eyes. 

“When will I get to meet your mother? The wedding is approaching fast.” She asked as they walked away from the house. He thought about it for some time before responding “You know she’s very ill… She might not even make it to the wedding date.” Anita turned him to face her saying “All the more reason I should meet her soon. Please honey… You promised!”

Sighing deeply, he replied “Alright… Soon… I promise!” It was a promise he knew he would have to keep despite the consequences. Soon enough Anita would meet his mother. Only then she would realize that his mother’s sickness was of the mind rather than the body. She would realize too late, just like his ex had, that his mother would only allow one love in her only child’s life.

He wondered if the love would leave her eyes as quickly it had with each of his exes. It seemed to be the first thing to go, the light from the eyes followed by the glow of the skin. He could preserve the other features of her body, but those seemed to be the two elements that escaped his abilities. 

He took another deep look into his fiancées eyes and studied them. Carefully examining the light of life and love, trying to memorize it for the next set of glass eyes from the taxidermy shop."

Everyone knows that if you lose a tooth and slip it under your pillow your parents will come in the dead of night and replace it with money claiming it was the ever mysterious Tooth Fairy. Seems harmless and innocent, right? Wrong.

Ever wondered how a myth like the Tooth Fairy came to be? I mean a story about a fairy who collects fallen teeth in the night doesn't simply pop out of existence because it didn't. But the thing from which the Tooth Fairy sprang from is much more dangerous than the one who leaves behind money for good little children. I'm talking about the **Teeth Eater.**

The Teeth Eater has been around for as long as humans have. Nobody knows where it came from. We just know what it does. The victims of the Teeth Eater are found with their jaws ripped open and each tooth plucked and pulled out of the child's mouth, one by one until their mouth is a bleeding mess of stumps and gum. Then the creature uses its extremely long fingers, designed for plucking teeth, to reach down the child's throat, effectively choking the them to death.

If you want to know what it does with the teeth then all you got to do is look at the name. Some say she eats them. Others say she sticks them into her own toothless gums so she can eat herself. I say both. It honestly depends on whether or not you've been a good boy, brushing your teeth everyday. If you didn't then you'll probably regret not listening to mommy and daddy because if your teeth are shiny and healthy, she'll pluck them out and keep them as her own teeth, pushing them inside her gums making her fangs seem uneven and misshaped, but if your teeth are rotting then so are you. In those cases she will use her previous victim's teeth to eat you alive. She repeats this until her current teeth become rotten or broken, then she finds a new set.

Some say she comes in the form of a lady in a white dress. Others say she is in the form of an emaciated and shrivelled black body with a huge mouth and sunken, hollow eyes with rotten hair.

As for how I know all this? Trust me. You'd be surprised how much time you have on your hands when you can only consume quick and fast liquids. All I want is for nobody else to fall to my mistakes. The way you invite her into your home and into your mouth is a mistake most people make when they're young and have loose teeth. Do not grind your teeth against each other or swirl around the loose tooth in its gums. The sounds attract her to what she sees as a shiny new set of teeth to add to either her collection or her stomach..."

The children's wing at St. Jude's was packed as usual. Most of the children were excited about the toys and gifts they'd be receiving; however, some were scared this might be their last Christmas. This sad reality weighed heavily on the mind of Susan. She wiped away the tears as she tried to fall asleep, clutching teddy tight.

The next morning, as Susan was being transported down to the basement, she was passed by Thomas, a newly admitted patient to the PICU. Reaching out to Susan's bed, Thomas grabbed teddy and held it close. The nurses exchanged a heavy nod and kept walking.

Three days later, Thomas' pneumonia got the best of him but teddy was there with him the whole way. Thomas was sent down to the basement; teddy back to the children's wing.

A few days before Christmas, the nurses were collecting letters for Santa. When asked for his letter, Kevin shook his head. He had teddy. After all, teddy had brought him and others so much comfort and joy. Kevin wrote no letter to Santa and by the next morning, it wouldn't matter anyway.

It was Christmas Eve. The children's wing was full of life. After visits from Santa and his elves, the children were tired and eager to go to bed. Jessie snuggled teddy gently to sleep.

Later that night, Jessie awoke to a strange inhaling sound. She was confused by it but growing sleepier and sleepier. The inhaling sound grew more aggressive, like someone taking deep, purposeful breaths. Jessie fell deeper into sleep. That was when Nick awoke and saw teddy on top of her.

The nurses rushed to the children's wing. By the time they arrived, they were shocked to see all the children upright in their beds; all except Jessie. They reassured the children Jessie was simply going downstairs for a routine exam but Nick knew better. After what he saw, he knew they'd never see Jessie again. The rest of the children fell back asleep while Nick stayed awake, shuddering in fear.

It was Christmas. All the children were laughing and playing with their new toys. Seeing Nick finally rouse in his bed, one nurse rushed over to greet him, plopping something small and fluffy on his lap. He gasped to find teddy with a wide, hungry smile on its face. Nick started to scream but quickly lost the will. He watched in sleepy horror as his life force drained from his lips in rich, youthful wisps and into the mouth and body of the hand-me-down teddy. Running out of time and strength, he gripped teddy's body and pulled its head clean off, spilling white stuffing everywhere.

Nick awoke the next morning in the recovery room, surrounded by a few nurses. They all comforted him and wished him well. One nurse stepped forward and handed him something. His heart dropped when he saw its wide, hungry smile.

They frighten me more than you can imagine.

I had seen the movies, read the comics and I know how much the Media tends to exaggerate the creepiness of them but still.

I know that not all clowns are serial killing space spiders, or maniacs obsessed with spreading Chaos.

But damn, those smiles.

They freak me out more than they should.

So when I encountered a clown making his way towards my home I fucking freaked out.

I had been making my way home myself, I just came back from a late night gaming session with my best friend from school when I saw him.

The clown wore a classic clown suit and had white make up with the classic red nose and smile but the similarities with a normal clown stopped there.

This clown was covered in blood, it was dripping from his mouth down his suit.

The clown smiled at me when I yelped.

He turned his face towards me and I got a good look at him, which made it all the worse.

There was no smile painted on his face, instead he had a large gap in his cheek in the rough form of a smile.

The image of raw cut flesh still haunts me to this day.

He saw me and tried to reach out for me, stepping forward and making a screeching sound.

I managed to act and I managed to kick him in the kidney.

He fell back and more blood gulped down his face, all the while that haunting smile was plastered on my face.

I fucking ran.

It was not until the next morning that I learned about what happened.

And the truth was horrifying.

A serial killer struck yesterday, causing a slaughter at a nearby circus.

The killer in particular had a weird thing for carving smiles in the faces of his victims.

When I heard this I froze, realizing that the clown was not a monster but a victim, reaching out for help.

But it wasn’t until the police came by that the true horror struck.

I first thought that they were going to arrest me for assaulting the clown yesterday.

But they were not there for me.

Instead they came to talk about my brother.

ecr97g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ecr97g/do_not_speak_to_them/,Do Not Speak to Them,22,3,1576750032.0,"“Sacred Family Elementary was built over the site of a World War II munitions factory,” Principal John Raik explained. “One night, a live tank round rolled into a box of hand grenades. The explosion shattered the windows of the church down the block. One hundred sixty-three people died. The church purchased the property from the town, and built a school where the workers’ children could attend, free of charge. I’d like to close the basement but our enrollment dictates those classrooms are needed. Nothing school-related takes place in the basement past 4:00pm.”

“Remember,” Raik continued, “do not speak to them. They pose no threat to you as long as you don’t engage them in conversation. I want you to repeat, ‘just us two’. We are the only two people in the building. No matter what you see down there, understand?”

Will nodded hesitantly.

Based on the movies he’d seen, Will expected horribly disfigured ghouls. Other than the outdated clothing, they looked...normal. He repeated over and over, ‘just us two’, as Raik had commanded. 

The entities scuttled in and out of rooms and walls silently. Raik opened a closet to reveal a mop. “After the classrooms are cleaned, the hallway must be wet-mopped once a week,” Raik led Will back to the office.

Will worked for one month. He started in the basement immediately after school, before anything appeared. He couldn’t see them but definitely felt them. Student artwork hanging in the hallway would move. A drawing fell to the floor, picked itself up, and secured itself back to the wall. Whenever Will felt compelled to run he repeated, “just me, just me.”

Then, Will’s car died. It was 7:15pm when he got to the basement that was silently buzzing with activity, as it was when Principal Raik showed him why he was the highest paid janitor in the county. 

Will grabbed the mop, the spirits moved around him, not taking any interest. 

Distracted about his car, Will forgot the only rule of the basement. A man in a faded military uniform walked past Will lighting a cigarette. “Careful buddy, wet floor,” Will said.

The entity stopped. Will realized his mistake. Will looked around and saw them all staring at him.

Will’s heart raced and he ran towards the stairs in a panicked sprint. Will slipped on the wet floor. He turned to face them. They crowded over Will. He screamed and they were on him. 

Will sat up and heard a man giving a static speckled speech on an old radio. He heard machines whirring and conversations. He heard the *click-clack* of high heels on cement. The man in the military attire squatted down next him with a smile and offered a gold case, “Cigarette?”

Will saw Raik with someone by the mop closet. He jumped up and ran to them. He yelled and waved his arms. They didn’t make a sound or acknowledge him. He could read their lips. “*Just us two.*”"
ecpaee,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ecpaee/what_death_sees/,What Death Sees,440,22,1576736409.0,"Death slowly walks across the street. 

A man exits his house still clad in his pajamas. Yawning, he shuffles onto the porch and picks up the paper. Death looks at the small clock above his head. It reads 17 years. Nope. Not today. 

The door of the next house opens. An old lady. Her clock reads 1 minute and 13 seconds. Patiently, Death waits until the number winds down. On cue, the old woman trips on her way to get her paper. She lands on her head, a motion accompanied by a ""crrrrck"" as her neck twists halfway around. 

Death approaches the old lady. ""Come with me."" The old lady gets up and follows. 

Continuing on her path, she spies a dog. It whines pitifully, begging for food it doesn't receive. It collapses, no longer having strength to stand. Patiently, Death watches its clock wind. 

She scratches the dog behind the ears. ""Come with me."" The dog follows, tail wagging. 

""Come along,"" she says to the homeless man. 

""Follow me,"" to the man who just plummeted from the roof. 

Near the coffee shop, Death patiently waits for the clock of an elderly man to hit zero. After a 16 minute and 48 second wait, he clutches his chest and collapses in line. She follows as paramedics come and put him into an ambulance, performing emergency procedures all the while. 6 minutes and 12 seconds later, she has another addition to her parade. 

A good days work, she thinks. Turning, she sees a group of children playing. Innocence. Beauty. Hope. Life. She stops to soak in the laughter. 

Wait. 

Something's not right. 

The little girl catches the ball, the epitome of youth. But her clock is plummeting. 78 years. 70 years. 64 years. Death frowns. This wasn't on the agenda for today. 

""Ruth!"" Comes a harsh yell. ""Enough playing, c'mere!"" Death turns to see an unkempt man calling from a rundown house across the street. 

The young girl looks back but continues playing. 

""Get over here you ungrateful piece of shit,"" the man snarls from the doorway. 

Reluctantly, the little girl waves to her friends and runs across the street.

Death watches the car coming. The clock winds down. 56 years. 33 years. 

With a honk that fades with distance, the car veers, narrowly avoiding the little girl. 

Death stands frozen as the clock continues ticking down.

""RUTH!"" The grizzled man shouts, the stench of alcohol smothering his breath.

Death follows the girl into the house; her followers wait outside. Bottles are strewn around and furniture lies in shambles. 22 years. 16 years.

Death slowly turns back to watch the man and little girl. 

Whack. Thud. ""Wanna play with your friends, huh? Can't even spare a minute to listen to your old man, huh?"" Thwack. 11 years. 6 years. Thump. 2 years. Crack. 4 months. Thud. 7 weeks. 2 hours. 

10 seconds. 

A sad look is on Death's face. ""Follow me,"" she gently says."

ecnbee,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ecnbee/i_bought_a_reborn_doll/,I Bought a Reborn Doll,65,6,1576725566.0,"Before you judge me, let me explain my reasoning.

When I was 15, I was told I would never be able to have kids. It was hard to deal with since I love kids so much. I even dropped my dream of becoming a veterinarian to be  able to work with kids instead.

But I've been feeling more baby fever lately so I figured, maybe I could get a doll to help cope?

My grandma loves those reborn dolls, collected them for years. I wouldn't of known about them if it weren't for her. I did did a quick Google search of ""reborn baby dolls"" and clicked the first link I saw.

It was called Francesca's Dolls and the reviews seemed pretty good. After a few minutes (okay, more like 30) I finally found the perfect doll. It was made to look like a sleeping newborn girl. I clicked the add to cart button and went off to grab my credit card.

As I punched in my info, my computer screen suddenly shut off. It was strange but I thought nothing of it, even when the screen flashed red.

It took about three weeks for my hundred dollar doll to come in. I came home from work and found the pretty pink package sitting on my doorstep. It wasn't in a regular box with an address on it, just a pink box.

Oh, how naive I was.

I rushed inside and opened it without hesitation and-

It wasn't what I expected at all.

The supposedly sleeping doll wasn't stiff at all, surprisingly. She felt very real. But her eyes.. they were gaping? And her mouth was wide. 

I picked her up like a baby and examined her. 

Her head lolled to the side, her tongue flopping out. I let out a shriek

It had a razorblade going through it. But the worst part hadn't happened yet.

When I dropped her, she crunched. Like a real baby.

I must've made a loud noise though, because my neighbour showed up unexpectedly. He stared at me, then the baby, then me again. Then he doubled over and puked before scrambling for his phone to dial 911.

Well, I hear them getting closer now. I've been hiding because I know they'll never be on my side. I wrote my side of the story here just so someone, anyone, can know I'm innocent."
ecmrjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ecmrjy/testing_day/,Testing Day,3,0,1576722813.0,"I sit, silent, at the center of the room. Mother had always said to be wary. To be careful not to look Them in the eye. To sit straight, and keep my hands on the table, and to stay quiet. After all, it is Testing Day. I have trained my whole life for this moment.
    So I sit in the middle of the dimly lit room, shivering, but not because of the cold. I see a shapeless man enter the room, silent as a mouse. He is not fat, yet not thin, not handsome but not ugly. He sits down next to me. I close my eyes, trying to resist the urge to recoil. Though the man is nothing to look at, I can feel his power, his confidence. “Open your eyes,” he commands. I do so, and find myself staring into them. His eyes. Filled with an emotion beyond my understanding, not hateful, not friendly, but something in between, as distant and alien as the stars in which they came from. He stares into mine, silent, gauging my worth. He pulls out a device, and looks down, quickly typing something into it. Then, slowly, he tells me, “I have judged your worth. You’re coming back with me back to my planet.” A million forbidden questions pop into my head. I wonder if I was drafted into their army to smite their distant enemies, or if not, what else I will have to do to help them win their upcoming war. As if he knows what I’m thinking, the man says, “You may look at your results. But don’t expect to understand them. They were written in our tongue.” I don’t tell him that I learned Their language by listening to the soldiers that were always stationed near our home. He turns his hand to me, I look at the small device in his palm. I barely make out the words: “Top quality - live enemy target dummy.”"

I still remember the way my legs felt every time I used them. I also remember the way I lost them, how I would. The table I’m strapped against is the only reason I can stay fed, let alone feed others. The wide smile of that man before he took my legs would haunt me, which is why I asked him, “Why are you smiling?” If I asked him this, he would’ve gotten angry, so I’ll try not to. It’s almost like he knew I’d survive, even though he knew I shouldn’t, I have thin blood. I’m going to drown if he doesn’t come back, and my kids will starve. I don’t understand why I’m here, how I’m going to get here, or why. All I know is that it’s closing time, I would soon be able to tell from the lights going out. Did nobody see me? Can nobody hear me splashing in the water, frantically writhing around, asking for someone or something to take me home? Sure, I’m getting my wish, something is coming. Of course, I won’t have any hope of escape on my own, this pool has walls around it, which tower above me. I swear I could hear chittering from above, along the edges of the walls. Something hungers for me, and I couldn’t do anything about it, I’m powerless. The metal walls moan, and something in the drain would scream for me. I hear it, but I don’t listen. It knows me. It can taste me. I couldn’t give in, even when a scratch appeared on the wall when I wasn’t looking, one that wasn’t from claws. I’d hear something splash in the pool behind me, but I couldn’t turn to look. A blink is all it takes for me to miss something now, I haven’t seen most of the things that happen around me, I’d only notice what’s different. The scratches, the screams, the moans, they’d come together in some kind of embodiment of an unknown thing. It was wild, thirsting for something that would never sate it’s appetite. I can’t see, let alone open my eyes, simply because I’m afraid of doing so. “YOU THINK YOU’RE INVISIBLE?????” A raspy, high-pitched voice would ask me right into my ear. She wouldn’t break me. I could hear it wading around me in the water. It would touch me, graze me with whatever it had on its body to so with. I’d be confused on the shape of it, what strange appendages protruded from whatever odd form it existed as. I can’t open my eyes to see, I’d break. By then, it feels as if my eyes are sealed shut, my eyelids fused together, the lashes nonexistent, as if I’ll be born with them that way. I’ll almost be able forget they even exist. That’s when I heard it; another agonizing scream comes from the drain, the walls moan. I wish that man took more than just my legs."

I’m hopeless

Moving closer and closer
And closest.

No light
I can’t see
He’s next to me

He reads me
Like a book
He could tell
I’m claustrophobic 

I fell asleep
But not of my fault
It was him
He made me do it

Just my size

Darkness everywhere

The one at the carnival that’s cheesily spooky and silly. Families go in laughing. You can go in with your cotton candy and just chat, maybe have a laugh with some friends. Take pictures, explore… but do not trust the Mirrors: they aren’t of silver. 

You may get separated from your group of friends. You could get lost for hours in the House of Mirrors, if you don’t pay attention. You see a shadow out of the corner of your eye, but you could never tell if it’s your imagination or the Mirrors’ distortion. And if you aren’t careful, a reflection might seem more like reality than reality ever has. 

You can’t be sure, but your own reflection looks like it’s smiling at you, even though you’re not smiling at all. You hear laughing. It isn’t from your friends. The floor and ceiling seems to twist and move, only confusing you more as you attempt to leave this once childish place. Sweat is running down your back; it feels like spiders. There’s nothing to be feared here, not really… right? 

Someone (something?) whispers your name. Someone (you realize now that it is definitely something… it definitely isn’t human) that can't be your friends knows your name. Only, there’s no one in the reflections. You can’t tell where to look- it’s just more reflections. There is no direction. 

Everything seems to descend into chaos, and then… you hear footsteps that seem to right you. They are approaching behind you. Upon turning around, you might see what looks like your friends. But something is different. There is something almost inhuman about them… but maybe they were never human to start with.

All that looked back though was darkness. He could feel it piercing his eyes. Seeping into his brain and filling it with the nightmare. 
He banged on the glass once more, this time with purpose. A small crack began to appear. He focussed on the darkness. Like a predator hunting it’s prey. A steely determination flowed through him but as always there was no sign of the beast. 
The knowledge that it was out there spurred him on until a sudden pain cut through him and he closed his eyes completely. 
The darkness encumbered him and he felt imprisoned by his own skin. The sound of silence deafened him and he began to feel his earlier optimism had been subjugated. 

He had seen the beast before and had spent the majority of his adult life hiding from it. 
It was now time to confront it. He wanted to see it face to face. Look into its eyes, into its soul. 
David had come to realise that finding the beast was proving to be just as difficult a task as hiding from it once was.

Suddenly the beast banged twice onto the glass. David fell backwards in shock. It was here. He got to his feet as it banged again, this time with more force. 
The crack in the glass expanded. 
David held both his hands up to his head. The pain, like the crack, was growing. He moved his head closer to get a better look. 
Just as he was about to see the beast the crack grew again and the glass shattered.

David fell to his knees, broken. 
He looked down at the bathroom floor. Past his blood covered hands, and down at the smashed mirror, now lying on the ground in pieces. 
He could barely make out a face in one of the shards; it was looking at him, into his eyes, into his soul. 
THE BEAST. 
He looked back at his hands - “What have I done?”"

So chances are, someone reading this knows exactly what I'm talking about.  You'll be sitting there then it sounds like a demon mosquito has made its nest in your ear. A high pitch, shrill noise that makes your brain cringe.  There's little you can do to help, just suffer through it. 

  
  I've dealt with this all my life as far as I can remember, the shrieks coming way too often.  Every time I would grasp my ear in annoyance and pain, my eye watering up.  Recently, I noticed that the shrill sound I was so familiar with was dropping in pitch. I immediately thought it was just genetic hearing loss, but as the past few days slogged on, the tinnitus became more frequent and deeper.  It's almost as if someone put a large bass drum in my ear and beating it hard once everyday.   

  
  Today, I was outside making my way to my car for work.  I was dropped to my knees from the now deep sound, clasping my head in pain.  When I looked up, large silhouettes blotted out the sun and seemed to be advancing; the earth trembling underfoot, all other noise blocked by the tone.

""Wake up, Ellie."" More forceful this time, a boy's voice insisted. He sat in the hospital chair next to her bed.

Ellie opened her eyes, slowly. The cancer made it hard to do much more than this; lesioned bones aching at the slightest movement.

""Hi Ellie,"" the boy smiled. Moussy, brown hair dampened his forehead above dimpled cheeks. He couldn't have been more than seven, about her age.

""Who are you?"" She muttered, weakly. Her hair long since lost to the failed chemotherapy.

""I came to help you.""

""Where are my mum and dad?""

""I let them sleep for a little while, so we could talk."" The boy's smile only grew.

""Do I know you?"" She whispered.

""No, but I came to help.""

""What do you mean?""

""You won't feel any more pain. I'm here to take you away."" Something about the boy's words felt final. Ellie could feel her pain beginning to slip away almost immediately, her strength growing moment by moment.

""Are you an angel?"" She asked, her eyes filled with wonder.

""Something like that,"" he laughed standing up. He walked towards the door, beckoning. Ellie sat up but felt no more pain. Tenderly, she put weight on her feet and gasped as she stood up after being bedridden for so long.

""We should go before the others come.""

""What others?""

""Don't worry about them, I'll protect you.""

Outside they turned a corner and found her mum and dad curled up on one of the sofas, asleep.

""Can I say goodbye?"" Ellie pleaded, pulling at the boy's hand. Tears filled her eyes.

""Okay,"" he relented.

Ellie walked over to her mother, quietly. She reached down and stroked her face.

""Goodbye, mama."" Ellie cried softly.

""Ellie..."" Her mother mumbled, half-asleep.

""We have to go now. They'll be okay. I promise.""

Suddenly a sound rang out, distant but distinct. Trumpets.

""The bad ones are coming, we have to go"" the boy implored, fearfully.

The trumpets sounded a little closer.

Ellie took one last look at her parents, tears falling down her cheeks.

""Please don't forget me,"" she whispered to them. Ellie grabbed the boy's hand again.

At the end of the hall he stopped by a door, pulling out a large, ornate key.

""Are we going to heaven now?"" Ellie asked.

""Somewhere even better, I promise. It's where all the special children go.""

He unlocked the door, light suddenly pouring through the crack underneath and the keyhole. He opened it, drenching them in blinding sunlight.

""Just step into the light, Ellie."" He shouted over the now deafening trumpets, the door and walls shaking in trepidation at the imminent arrival of something otherworldly.

Ellie hesitated for a moment. She cast one last look at the boy. He smiled at her, kindly and she stepped through.

The boy sighed deeply before letting a terrible laugh curse his lips.

The purest souls always tasted the sweetest. 

He followed Ellie into the light."

His skin begat scales and gnat to rape the earth bare 
His eyes, a deepness that swallowed fear. 
Born of demon union, he killed his mother at birth
The legend of the Reaper is a definition of evil's wrath
He possessed a thorned wraith, 
That sprouted black roses
His soul entwined and in thick, green blood bathed 
Drunk from blood of different races, taken in large doses


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap


The sickle came from an ancient war
A time mingled with hate, pride and kings
Thousands fell by the sword and other gore 
Too much to collect, souls with bitter stings
He needed a sickle to gather the lost 
Piercing right through them, never caring for the cost


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap 


He was the gateway between death and life
And in unholy matrimony, he bacame Satan's wife 
Tortured men in pots of boiling oil
Revelling in their tormented, condemned decay 
Banned from ever walking the earth's soil
He loathed man and his every breathing day
Until one time, a shadow shifted and a body fell
Some words got scrambled and the ban lifted
The Reaper was ushered into man's safe place


Angels on watch, my soul you keep
Save it from the Reaper's bloody reap 


Necks snapped from ropes, dangling suicides 
Teenagers raped little boys to restless oblivion 
Races and people annihilated called it genocide
He giggled at his effect, destroyed the balance; every perfection gone. 
Trembling underneath my bed, I quiver
Listening to the chaos and unspeakable horrors make me shiver.. 
Fingers numb at the beads.. 
They all count on me like a rosary.. 
But I have only one prayer


 Angels on watch, my soul keep 
Save me from the Reaper's bloody reap."

It happened this morning, my son was lying on his bed and he said it, those cursed words.

“Ok Boomer.”

I had heard about this “internet meme” but I never expected my own son to call me that.

The so called “Ok Boomer” meme came by on Facebook a few times but I never paid much attention to it, just some bored teenagers with too much time who should be getting a job.

But when my own son called me that, I panicked.

As a single dad I cared a lot about my son, he was my entire life.

But he called a Boomer.

My son wouldn’t just call me a Boomer, I know my son.

He’s a good boy, but somehow he learned those cursed words.

I don’t know how he even learned about the “Ok Boomer”, my son doesn’t talk to other children and he doesn’t surf the web.

My good son never doesn’t even go to school or leave the house.

He’s blind and mostly handicapped and never leaves the basement.

So how’d he learned those words?

I’ll guess I’ll have to torture it out of him tonight.

I won’t allow anyone to corrupt my good son."

Jeffrey stopped the massage when Stacy reached for her blouse. 

“Something’s out there.”

He zipped up. He looked at her. 

She looked beautiful, especially when she was scared, and he wished that she’d let him do something. Kiss her. Screw her. Anything. 

But it was hopeless. 

The mood had been ruined. They’d just drive down to her neighborhood, where he would try to avoid the streetlights, those vomit-colored beams of static. She’d leave without saying goodbye. Not even sparing him a passing glance.

And he’d go home with blue balls. 

Not that it was her fault. It was his. 

“I think we should go,” she whispered, eyes now locked on his. “I don’t like it... out… here.” 

Jeffrey looked down at the key. He reached for it, and was about to turn it when he heard something. A shriek. A scratching sound. 

Like the claws of a very large, very clumsy bird. 

Like the grasping fingers of the dead. 

And Stacey screamed, an explosion. He felt her hands gripping him. Nails dig into his flesh, and he tried to push her away. She only clenched her fists tighter than before. 

Something knocked on the roof. Hard. 

And then, the knocking turned to popping. He looked up. Even in the dark, he could see the claws. They were midnight black and curved inward. Piercing the fingertips. 

The charcoal fingertips. 

They wiggled. 

They inched downward. 

Stacey stopped screaming. Began to whimper, like a wounded dog. She crawled backwards, a stray foot striking him. His balls really were blue now. 

She scaled the seats behind them. 

But not Jeffrey. He could only watch as the rest of the thing’s fingers broke through the metal roof, splitting it open. A deep black eye peered inside. It found him almost immediately. 

He held his breath. The fingers were followed by marble-sized knuckles, and those knuckles were then followed by a hand. 

A backwards hand. 

The rip opened wider. The thing pushed its shoulder through. 

Jeffrey heard a car door being slammed shut, and he knew she had escaped and was running away. Outside. 

Outside. 

The last thing he ever saw was the thing’s hand, gnarled with veins and twitching. It was growing bigger. 

And bigger. 

And bigger."
ecbpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ecbpdr/the_holiday_party/,The Holiday Party,39,1,1576670505.0,"David sat at the blood drenched table where his CEO once sat at. He almost decided against showing this year, as he knew he wasn’t going to be getting any bonuses with the way her fucked over his boss last quarter. The scrumptious manager from the marketing department invited him as her date so he agreed.

The holiday party started off well enough, some people were taking a while to loosen up while others had pre-gamed before they arrived. It all started on December the 7th, the main event being the boss handing out bonuses to whoever bent over far enough for him that year. 

After the party started getting wild was when the party blasted downhill. First, a man who used to work directly with the CEO, named Charles, showed up uninvited to the party. He had given up working on this company to start a new venture that didn’t work out for him, and we was out for blood.

Charles screamed at the CEO, words that David no longer remembers, and the party stopped dead in its tracks. Charles was escorted out by the CEOs personal security team and the party awkwardly continued on. A few hours later the CEO gave his closing comments. People then gathered their things to head home but the doors would not open. It was then that everyone realized that the hotel staff was nowhere to be seen.

Employees tried to break down the doors, bust windows, and call for help but nothing worked. They weren’t able to physically leave. Once morning came, the employees were dividing into cliques: the violent group who would do anything to get out, the passive group who wanted to wait it out, and David, who had retreated to a corner by himself, smoked his last cigarette.

Eventually, once the next night arrived, the groups had turned on the CEO, blaming him for them being unable to leave the ballroom. After they beat him mercilessly, they stabbed him repeatedly with the leftover steak knives from dinner the night before. Once he was dead, the groups started attacking each other. They fought over the remaining food, drinks, and territory within the ballroom. The finance and accounting firm sticking together as marketing and sales grouped up against the other teams. 

David sat back and watched as the whole company unraveled. By the end of the third day, over half of the employees were dead. Once everyone realized that no one is leaving no matter what, the employees started to relax and the fighting stopped. People kept to themselves as the flesh of the fallen started to fill the ballroom with a stench so foul the employees put up a makeshift wall between them and the dead. 

After the first five days passed, David grew too hungry to just let the bodies rot. He wiped a knife free of the CEOs blood, cut open the cute marketing manager, and took a bite.

Thoom. 

The oven closes. I instantly smell something burning. Smoke! Flames! Someone, help! 

And then I wake; another dream. I can practically feel the bags under my eyes, the product of many sleepless nights. I lay back down and let my heavy eyelids return me to slumber. 

-LET ME OUT-

Screams! Pounding, scratching on the walls! Where's my brother? Oh God is he in there? Was he forced in there with everyone else O God -- 

I'm up again. I knuckle my eyes and bury my face in the pillow. I know this will be my last chance to get some sleep.

There are hundreds of gunshots, but I only hear these two. The back of mommy and daddy's heads disappear, and their body's collapse along with the world I knew. But I know this is a dream, right?

I smiled and followed them to the bathroom door.  Tapped to the door was a typed note.

To my beautiful Rose: I've drawn you a hot bath and put on your favorite music. Relax for as long as you want. I love you - X

I opened the door to find candles, a hot bath, and a radio playing my favorite classical song. My first thought was how romantic this was, my second was wondering where my husband was. That's when I noticed the little closet door open slightly, he was hiding.

I giggled slightly and undressed. The water was the perfect temp. I stayed for an hour before my husband walked in. From the entry door. He looked shocked and confused.

ec5y4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ec5y4i/lovely/,Lovely,49,4,1576634489.0,"The night began beautifully. 

My lover took me to dinner, we had a few drinks and shared a few laughs. Our song played throughout the establishment-- Can't Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli, of course-- as we basked in each other's company. I had thought about proposing, right then and there. They looked absolutely delightful, and stunning, just as usual. But tonight they were clad in an outfit much more elegant, colored all red and nothing more. It suited them, as well as the environment. I absolutely love them, my dear lover. Things only took a turn when I suddenly blacked out. 

They then helped me out, however. They lent me a hand. I don't remember quite much, but they were of course very kind, and insisted that we go home immediately. I love the way that they watch over me.

As I now lay in the back, comfortably bound and just a bit tipsy from our shared sparkling cider, I notice that the smell isn't quite so pleasant. Of course it won't bother me, I love them so, despite these irrelevant flaws. My other senses are taking in various amounts of pleasurable sensations; the tune of the rain beating against the metal vehicle as my love continues to drive us back home, the faint sound of them playing our song through the radio in the front seat, the warmth and near numbness my body feels as I continuously slip between consciousness and sweet slumber.

Oh what a gorgeous night it was. Nearly breathtaking.

I feel oh so glad that they are the one doing all of this to me and for me. I know it isn't an easy thing to hear when asked, and I know that they still have their doubts. 

They bring the movement of the car to a silent halt, and almost immediately after, my eyes are suddenly exposed to the beam of a flashlight and the sound of their unapologetic sobs. I had always loved that about them, how they would cry when they were sad, without trying to hide and lie. ""I can't do this,"" they tell me, oh so frightened. ""I love you. You know that I do. Why must you have me do this?""

This is something I did not like so much about them; how they always questioned these antics that they know we must follow. But I only grin. They always were the type to worry. ""Sweetheart..."" I coo, ""Would you like me to do this instead?""

They then look at me in shock with their lovely, tear-stained face. They begin to cry even harder, gnawing their bottom lip to silence their whimpers and whines. Even then, trembling and seemingly affrighted, they cut me loose and decide to hand me their pistol. I nod knowingly, understanding what needs to be done in order for us to proceed to the next realm with our Almighty. They understand as well, and kneel before me with their oh so beautiful eyes bolted shut. I will miss their color and the life that they held, but we are needed and must move on from this place.

With only seconds left, they whisper sweet nothings. I am now pressing the pistol to the center of their forehead, prepared and eager to begin anew with our Almighty. ""She will be proud to be with us again."" They tell me. I nod happily, and one last time, they meet my gaze with mutual love. They smile, that oh so sweet smile, creating a picture perfect view to which I pull the trigger. 

The innards of their cranium display perfectly in a pool of vermilion, matching the delicate shade of the outfit that our Almighty had chosen for them on this special night of their rebirth. She will be proud with this result.

And now it is my turn. I only hope that I will be just as appealing to Her as my dearest lover is to me."

More gallos humour though and never was liked by the people on the bus and some people in his year group. I knew from various minor details that he doesn't have a good home life but tried to keep happy. 

A couple days ago he told me something chilling

""Heya bill""

""Hi Frank"" 

""Have you seen what unas annus is?""

""Yea it's the thing about it being killed in 1 year""

""Not neces-"" he cut me off mid sentance 

""Speaking of death I'm gonna defiantly kill myself by the end of the year""

I was shocked. I... I didn't know what to say at all, it was just so out of left field.

""Dude... dont, it's not worth it. Trust me, it's better to prolong the period of time you have here because it will happen anyway. So dont""

""Why does it matter? As you said we are gonna die anyway.""

""No that's not what i meant by it will happen anyway. As in there are people here who will care if you die"" 

There was no more conversation afer that but he didn't seem convinced. 

I know that he has a lot of stuff he could use but I honestly think if he does kill himself he will take alot down with him

It’s not always so bad, but it can be pretty frustrating not knowing if the bananas rotted quickly because the kitchen went through another time loop or if the ghost is just being a dick again.

He spelled out he doesn’t touch bananas when I contacted him last month with a Ouija board. Since then I’ve used a typewriter to communicate with him, but man is he a slow typer.

“Where’d you put my car keys?” I’ll ask, running late for work.

I get the response after taking an Uber home.

    Cookie Jar

Son of a bitch likes to play hide and seek more than my niece, and that’s saying something.

I suppose it could be worse. I think he might even like me; it’s not like he’s actively trying to kill me or get me to move out like the last family. Only real way I could afford a house on my salary.

Still, there are days I feel like I’m going crazy. I’ll drop off a bag of take-out on the kitchen counter and head upstairs to change, only to find an exact copy of my clothes already laid out next to the hamper. I have to visit the bathroom downstairs, then the one near the bedroom, and finally the garage before the room will reset to the present.

To be fair, I sure as hell get my daily steps in.

I haven’t quite figured out the kitchen yet, though. Half the time I find my burrito half-eaten, and there was one time I went to the attic to find it whole when I returned. Something about crossing thresholds affects it, I think.

And at least the poltergeist and I share the same interests in television and games. I’d go nuts if he changed channels on me all the time or ruined my saves. It has made me avoid bringing people over, though.

But perhaps he’d be okay with it. I doubt he’s gotten any action in a long time, and I think he’d be okay with Sarah. She just seems like the type who’s willing to please.

I decided to take her home after our date later, grabbing a banana as I sort through the mail. A third of it was from last week, and I got a package for something I haven’t ordered yet.

It’s as I sigh about a bill for car repairs for next month that the banana doesn’t go down all the way. I struggle to breathe and search for a chair to perform the Heimlich on myself, finding them all moved to other rooms. My vision begins to go dark as I fall to the ground, begging for the ghost to punch the bit out of me.

Instead, I wake up to watch myself eating in the kitchen - the burrito from last Tuesday. And I suddenly understand why I had so much in common with the ghost."

One day he woke up and, to his surprise, found that he couldn't see his reflection in the mirror. After he accepted that he wasn't dreaming, the man started toying with this strange discovery.

He took a photo of himself naked and found nothing more than the wall of his room. He then filmed himself holding a glass of water and found that the glass mysteriously floated in mid-air. At some point, the man began to think that it was just him hallucinating all of this. So he decided to go outside and see if people could see him.

It turned out that everyone instantly stopped doing their activity and just stared at him, baffled, as if seeing a magic trick. The man couldn't help but stand there, as people slowly gathered around him. 

Later on that day, he found that a video just went viral. It was a video of himself running away from the crowd, but all he could see were his clothes, which appeared to be 'mysteriously' flying down the street. 

It was at that moment when he realized he was invisible.

The man locked himself in his room for a while, thinking about what just happened, until eventually, he decided to go outside again, but this time... fully naked.

Just as he thought, no one seemed to acknowledge his presence. So the man began exploring his 'new' world, the world that he could do anything as long as it didn't raise suspicions, the world that gave him a sense of absolute freedom he had never experienced before.

And he quite enjoyed it.

However, when he was back in his room, the man would always feel like there was someone else with him. Every time he lay in his bed, he would have this same feeling. It was as if someone or something slept in the exact same spot as him every night. But what really creeped him out was the rotten smell that he couldn't find where it came from, and it seemed to get more and more intense every day.

Until he couldn't take it anymore, the man put on clothes that covered all his body so people wouldn't suspect and moved out to find a new place to live. He then found a cheap motel room, where he came to the most shocking realization.

There was a news on TV that someone had just reported an intense, obnoxious smell coming from his old room. It was so awful that the police were called to investigate its cause.

The man was frozen in horror as the reporter started describing what was found inside. His eyes were fixed on the monitor. It showed a body wrapped in white being carried out of that room, followed by a blurry image of a rotten body lying on the bed, at the exact same spot he had been sleeping every night.

I threw my boots on and headed down C-corridor, still in my sleepwear.

  He’d been struck with leukaemia. One of the hardest cancers to treat in the world, and he’d been stuck with it almost since he was born. 

  And so as he stared up into the night sky, eyes brimming with hate filled tears, he wondered what anyone else would have. 

  “Why me?”

  The words bounced around in his juvenile mind, as the moon and stars seemed to shimmer and shift, reflected off his tears.

  Only that their shifting was never an illusion. Then the boy heard something else in his head. A voice not of his own. 

  “~Why couldn’t it be someone elseee~”

  The boy should have been scared. Should have been terrified. But the boy also had 4 weeks left to live. His response did not need to be heard to be understood. 

   That night, the boy slept more peacefully than he ever had in his life. He had felt something change inside of him, dreamed of a life of longevity ahead. For the first time in his life, he didn’t have to fear a death in sleep.

  And in the morning, for the first time in his life, he wished he’d never woken up. Because the voice had kept its promise. 

“~Why couldn’t it be someone elseee~”

  Only it wasn’t someone else. It was everyone else. The whole world had felt the change. Felt their guts drop to the floor. Felt their eyes go a little dim. Felt their blood turning against them. Lucky for them, they only lasted 4 weeks.

  The boy was not so lucky. The boy watched as the world died with that look in their eyes. The eyes of blame. The eyes of the sick cursing the healthy. He would come to miss those looks. Those looks of hatred his family gave him, because at least there was something that looked at him.

He can wrap his fingers around it. Wouldn’t take much strength, not much at all, to break it. Just one squeeze.

ebtuyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ebtuyp/a_word_from_an_artis/,A word from an artis,61,6,1576576509.0,"I draw humans, sometimes just with a pencil but sometimes with expensive high quality paint.

I can draw other things but my specialty is drawing humans in the end.

I don’t know why, but there’s something about drawing something that’s supposed to be moving and capturing it in one single frame.

How much emotion a human can put in a painting is endless, almost unnatural.

It's almost poetic, a human drawing a human.

It’s fragile, if they have the wrong pose it can break the illusion.

Can’t make the arms to long or it will look creepy.

If you draw their faces wrong it will be painful to look at.

But I became better at posing them and I think I perfected this art.

I learned to draw with a pencil, a brush and even learned how to make deeper lines with a scalpel.

Though I wished I could, I can not spend all my time drawing.

Sometimes I have to look at actual humans instead of the ones I paint, study their behaviour and try to find the best way to put them on paper.

Sometimes I have the feeling that I can draw humans all day and never get enough.

But sadly I can't.

You know that problem right?

You’re drawing for hours, or painting and just when you finished painting the humans you realise:

I ran out of skin."

The thumping noises it made as it crawled towards me were deafening, but not nearly as bad as the muted thuds against carpeting that signified it was getting closer.

I held my breath and shut my eyes as it perched itself on my bedframe and leaned towards me. I hoped it would at least make things quick.

No such luck. It pounced onto my chest and within seconds began digging its sharp claws into my abdomen, ripping into my guts and shoving them into its mouth by the handful. I started to scream on instinct, but turned and swung it's clawed fist at my jaw- blowing the whole thing off from my head before I could make any type of noise.

I sunk back in bed as it continued to tear me apart. Even as I sunk into unconsciousness the pain I felt was excruciating. As my vision blurred, I felt comfort in knowing it was almost over.

Then suddenly, at seemingly the snap of a finger the pain had vanished. I rose up in bed to see that my stomach and jaw were both once again in tact, though my jowls still felt a bit sore. As I took a moment to massage them, I heard a cough above me, and looked up to see the monster sitting at the end of the bed.

""Your meat."" It growled in its deep voice as it pointed a finger at my stomach, ""It's getting too fatty. Stay in shape, or else I'll find somebody else to eat from."" It snarled at me one last time, and cackled when I jumped up, before it crawled back onto the floor and scurried off, closing the door behind it.

Lying back in bed and staring at the ceiling, I contemplated my situation. It was difficult, being the monster's personal meal every night, the pain was unbearable and its process of revitalizing me afterward was always uncomfortable. On top of that, it never seemed completely satisfied afterward, and in a weird way it sort of hurt my feelings.

In the end though, I shut my eyes and tried to fall back asleep. At least, I thought to myself with a sigh, as long as it has me nobody else will have to deal with it."

“No, I left it at home.”


The guy shrugged. 


“Well, you can use mine. I’ll call your dad to make sure he knows you’re heading back. But first...” He squatted down until he was eye-level with Isaac. “Hey little buddy, do you like cowboys by any chance?”

His time was drawing near, he knew that much. Being a religious man, the end did not cause him fear, for he believed in an afterlife. He lived a good life. He'd be seeing his dear Beatrice soon enough. 

Watching the sun set, he could only feel content. He watched it turn orange, then red, as it sank below the horizon, his gaze shifting away only as a fit of coughing caused him to slump back into his pillow. His breath came in sharp rasps, each one a labor to his body. 

He didn't remember falling asleep. 

He woke up once with a sharp pain in his chest, then fell back onto his pillow, too weak to do anything but stare at the wall. He was unable to buzz for a nurse, but he heard footsteps coming his way.

When the doctor walked in, he found he couldn't turn his head. Or speak. He was aware of a monotonous buzzing. The doctor sighed, a sad look in his eye, and moved away from his field of vision. The buzzing stopped. Why was he unable to get the doctors attention?? Couldnt they see he needed help? 

The doctor approached him and shone a bright light into his eye. Finally, they'll do something about this... 

To his dismay, the doctor reached his fingers straight towards his open eyes, pulling the lids down over them. Darkness covered him in a silky blanket.

""This is outrageous,"" he wanted to say, but was unable to. 

It felt like hours went by before he heard a familiar voice. ""Dad!"" Hope kindled in him; his daughter would surely make things right. ""He was a good man, a kind man,"" he heard her sob. He felt her hand touch his. ""Heaven is celebrating the arrival of a pure soul..."" 

He wanted to scream. To stop his daughter's unnecessary anguish. To berate the hospital staff for their ineptitude. He was right here, listening to them ramble and ignore him, dammit! 

His insufferable rage reached a crescendo as he felt a sheet cover his body, felt himself being wheeled out of the room, heard some staff joking over the aroma of their meal, heard his daughter talking about arrangements...

Then realization crashed over him in a cold wave. He was dead. But there was nothing after. No afterlife which religion preached, absolutely nothing except an endless cognizant monotony for his soul, a fate he now knew awaited everyone upon death. He imagined the stuffiness of the coffin, the smell of detritus, the feel of worms burrowing through his eyes and slithering amongst his decaying flesh. No, there was absolutely no heaven - that was a lie - but he might just be in hell."

It was true love at first. It then became boredom, and boredom slowly transformed into hatred, like a benign tumor turning into cancer and eventually killed their relationship

She hates he always sniffs her hair while holding her in his arms. She hates the sound his key chains make when he walks. She hates the angle of his smile. She hates the way he talks. She hates the way he fucks. She hates everything about him.

When she told Tim she wanted a break-up, his tears poured down his face as if her words were missiles destroying the dams that were his eyes. That wasn’t the case. She was actually going for the heart, where it really hurt. She knew the only way to get out of this relationship was to break him.

And she did.

She had thought of him from time to time after the break-up - not that she wanted to get back together, but she just needed someone sometimes and Tim was always the guy - especially that night when she woke up freezing.

The chilling wind that caused the coldness blew into her flat with a high-pitched howl through an open window. Her heart sank. She always made sure she locked that window because people could easily got in via fire escape. The realization that this might be a break-in froze Jessica. Every corner in the dark she couldn’t see felt like there might be something lurking . She reached her hand out trying to grab Tim’s instinctively but there was no one there and this made her heart sank even deeper. What she didn't know was that if she had reached out any further, she might have *felt something*.

After a few minutes, when she was almost certain nothing was in her room, a little sound of metal colliding, almost like wind chimes, broke the silence. Jessica immediately dived under the sheet, trembling, almost drown in her own fear. She couldn’t told if the bed was actually moving or was she shaking too rapidly. She entered 911 on her phone but didn’t dial it, afraid she was just making things up out of fear.

Time passed and nothing happened. Jessica had convinced herself she was just being paranoid and started to doze off. When she finally fell asleep, she thought to herself maybe she was just scaring herself. Maybe Tim’s absence was really impacting her life. Maybe she needed to apologize to him. Maybe, maybe, maybe…

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've felt Tim slithered out from underneath her bed.

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've heard the sound Tim’s key chains made, like wind chimes, when he walked toward her with tears in his eyes and a knife in his hands.

Maybe if she hadn’t fallen asleep, she would've felt the knife tear through her heart.

I loved watching videos online of people teaching cockatoos to talk. I knew that they didn’t actually have much of a grasp of the language, but it was still so fascinating to me. I finally caved and decided to purchase a beautiful solid white one, named Belle. I love her. She is the sweetest bird, and teaching her to talk was so easy. It’s hard to remember sometimes that she is just repeating back learned phrases, not having a conversation with me. 

I want her to be able to pair words with feelings, such as “I’m hungry,” or “I want to play.” I want my beautiful bird to be happy in my home. It is just the two of us; I don’t have any close family or friends around often. She is the smartest bird and I love her so much. 

Tonight she was flying freely about the house, and she landed on the back of the couch, watching out the front window. “Scary outside,” she said. That’s odd, I thought. ‘Scary’ isn’t a word I have taught her. I felt a little uneasy, but I peeked out the window. I saw nothing, just an empty yard. 

“Belle, come,” I said as I held out my arm for her to hop on. I locked the front door and went into the kitchen to make dinner. She stayed in the kitchen with me, trying to steal bits of food as I cooked. I forgot about earlier already, sitting down and enjoying my meal.

Suddenly, Belle flew out of the kitchen and down the hall at full speed. I heard her rustling around a bit, then suddenly she screamed. “Scary, scary inside!”

If the world’s scientists and governments were ever aware of the impending invasion, they kept it to themselves. The very air seemed to suddenly grow heavy, and the skies darkened as ships flanked our planet. Their ships, six of them, were twice the size of the United States, shadowing entire continents; ushering in an oppressive darkness heretofore unknown by mankind. *Night* came suddenly, evilly, as if the Sun had been extinguished. 

They made no demands—offered no attempts at communication.  Their appearance was impossibly swift, as if by some faster-than-light means they had transported themselves into the space around our planet; presumably aware of us long before we were of them.  

When darkness fell on Earth, and when the undeniable reality of our imminent annihilation set in, the atrocities you’d expect to happen, happened. Looting, rape, murder, that collective indulgence of violence and depravity which before had barely been kept in check under the restraints known as “civilization” and “law”.  

What you might not have predicted is that such activities lasted for an hour, maybe ninety minutes. A fast and widespread realization came to both the civilian and military populations, that such things were useless, outright absurd, if one simply looked up and saw the country-spanning vessels of death hovering miles above our atmosphere.  

So, the crime and madness all stopped. Mankind, perhaps for the first time in its existence, resigned itself to doom at the hands of a seemingly insurmountable adversary. The aliens had yet to rain extraterrestrial death, but neither had they extended a tentacle or probe in peace, so without much else to do in its assuredly last moments, mankind did what it does best. It put on a show.  

Across the planet, in both rich and poor neighbors, small towns and bursting cities alike, concerts, parades, and sports events were held. People gathered, performed, watched others perform, and had one last “hurrah!” at the threshold of oblivion.  

The aliens, who had been priming their weapons for the eradication of Earthen life, had their interests piqued by the human’s strange, delusional display of mirth in the face of their destruction. Alien captains belayed their commands to fire, and using their spying instruments, observed the surface, where they saw billions playing and celebrating together.  

The aliens, beings whose civilization was derived from origins of absolute pragmatism and technological advancements at all costs, had forgotten—if they’d ever known—such displays of recreation. Closer they watched, and their amazement steadily grew, until the ship’s leaders led delegations to the surface, so that they could more closely study the never-before-seen behavior. 

Mankind, whose technology was of a comparatively primitive order, but still engineered with considerable powers of destruction, seized the opportunity, and simultaneously detonated Earth’s store of nuclear armaments; killing the alien delegation and themselves. In response, the ships above commenced orbital bombardment of the Earth; certainly not out of necessity, but spite—for they knew in a way they’d been beaten. "

Out of all the days in my life, it had to be today when our eyes finally met. I swear if it was some other day i could have been bragging about it. But today was different.

The morning was breezy, sunny and pleasant. Exactly how I don't like it to be. For the past few days it had been comfortingly cloudy which made it gloomy and cold. I liked it that way. But today it was all about birds chirping, children squeaking and flowers blooming. Like a fairy tale. 

And in this fairytale-like day I saw him. I see him almost everyday actually. I see him when I walk across the street, when i am coming back from grocery- always near my locality. I am guessing he stays somewhere near. And he kind of looks handsome. More like cute. 

But there is only one problem. He doesn't know I exist. Sigh! He just doesn't look at me. He doesn't know that I have been looking at him, searching for him, to be honest. Everytime I walk around I pray that I can get a glimpse of him.

But today as I was returning from my class, I saw him. It's a lucky day today. 
But something else happened. He turned his head and our eyes met. He looked at me and smiled. 

And smiled. 

Like he has always known me or something. I couldn't be more happy. That godly smile was directed at me. My heart skipped a beat.

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed my heart had skipped a beat. Two beats. Three. I had skipped all the beats it was supposed to be beating. 

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed the speeding car that did not stop at the signal.

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed the people panicking at what unfolded in front of their eyes.

If only I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed my  body lying on the street , bloodied and lifeless. 

If I wasn't entranced by his smile, I would have noticed he was not an ordinary person.

But I don’t remember when that happened. I don’t know what’s happened since. 

“Nearly there,” says my father, still hammering. The windows are all covered. The only light is from a little candle on the table. 

“Dad?” I can tell something’s wrong with my father. He’s not the same. The way he’s talking. The way he’s standing, like he’s dizzy or sick or weak like an old man. It’s all wrong. I don’t like it. “Dad?”

I scream at him. I claw my way to the nearest boarded up window and desperately try to peel back the barricade.

We were forbidden to go out when it was above thirty-two, but weeks of eating canned beans had done terrible things to our stomachs. Besides, it just snowed the day before, so we were confident no Fungus animals could have made their way up here yet. 

After morning prayer, we sneaked out of Camp to hunt in the forest. There’s me, who carried a hunting shotgun, Tom, who carried navigation equipment, and Danny, Tom’s older brother, who carried gasoline. Just like Tom and Danny, I was rescued into Camp after my family died from Fungus. We developed a liking for each other the moment we met, being the only teenage boys within Camp. Tom and Danny taught me that when killing someone with Fungus, I must aim for the head.

We were about two miles outside camp. Pine trees and boulders interspersed. On the snow, Tom noticed footprints. “Rabbit,” he whispered. Trying to be quiet, the three of us followed the footprints into a rocky terrain. We were so engrossed in the footprints, we didn’t notice the mountain lion crouching behind us. 

The lion pounced Danny and gnawed down on his neck. Tom tried to punch it in the face, but its claws grazed his forearm. I took aim and shot the lion straight through the skull but it was too late. Danny had bled out and died. 

Seeing the exposed skull of the lion, my worst fear was confirmed: Fungus had invaded its brain. Once an animal got infected, Fungus found the way to the brain and drove it crazy. The dead were not safe either, for Fungus somehow revived them. The only way to dispose dead bodies was to burn them. That’s why we carried gasoline. 

That evening, Camp leaders discussed how can a Fungus animal appear during winter. Some said the animal hid in a cave, others feared Fungus had mutated. Either way, they decided that Camp was not safe anymore. If we wanted to survive when summer came, we had to relocate five hundred miles further North, where the weather is permanently below freezing. I spent the next hour with Tom. He was strapped to the bed with leather belts. White liquid oozed out of his eyes. His mouth repeatedly made chomping motions, as if his only desire left is to bite.

In the morning, Tom’s bed was empty. Doctor couldn’t save him. We got order to leave Camp after breakfast. Even though it was seven in the morning, a heavy snowstorm made everything dark. The leaders said the snowstorm was advantageous because Fungus animals couldn’t attack us in this weather. We all set out on foot; snow piled deep to our knees. During morning prayer, I prayed that Fungus hadn’t adapted to the cold yet."

I’d never seen a dead body before. Not like this. She was on the riverbed, in a deep pool that had formed close to the bank. She seemed to be tangled up with the plants on the bottom although it was hard to tell in the swirling water. I could see her face clearly enough, it looked like those dead eyes inside of that bloated face were staring directly at me.
 
It took me five minutes to reach a section of the river where I could get phone reception. I called 911 and made my report. “Yes” I explained several times, “She’s most certainly dead. Yes, I just saw her there while fishing. Not five minutes ago.” I had to travel downriver another twenty minutes to meet up with the officers at the closest boat launch. I explained again what I had seen and then they followed me in their own boat, back to where I had seen her.
 
We finally arrived at the spot. She was gone. I kind of panicked, and I wondered if they were going to think I was making it all up. I pointed at the deep pool, “Down there, in the bottom” I said. One by one the officers started getting out of their boat. “Just stay there” they told me. I watched as they filed out onto the bank, one of them had a cadaver dog.
 
Two of the officers started donning scuba gear while the rest fanned out around the deep pool. I started staring at the pool again, the current must have dragged her further down the river, I thought to myself. I shook my head trying to clear the bile that was rising again. The two divers slipped in, I watched them go down to the bottom with their bright dive lights. Obviously nothing was down there. A few moments later one of them came up with a woman’s shoe, he handed it off to another officer who immediately bagged it. Just after that is when the dog started acting weird.
 
It was some sort of a hound dog and it started braying like it had a raccoon up a tree. It led the officer quickly downriver. All of the other officers, save for the two divers, followed the officer with the dog. They had made it about twenty yards when they started shouting. They had found something, more clothing I think. The dog seemed really excited at this point. I watched for a few minutes and then paced back to other side of the boat, wanting to see if the divers had found anything new. I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye, I looked up, and there she was. Standing in the tall grass on the opposite bank, staring at me with those dead eyes sunken into that bloated face."

We hope you’re ready.,761,38,1576526668.0,"I wake up in a small room of steel. At least, I think it’s steel - it’s a bit shinier and almost seems to move like water in the light, but what else could it be?

I don’t get much of a chance to inspect it as the only door opens. A man wearing a white suit and well-kempt facial hair smiles politely at me despite being flanked by a pair of guards. They’re all rather tall and sport a pair of wings, and the halos on their heads start a rush of memories flowing through my mind.

The suited man helps me up after I’ve fallen over, recoiling from the vision of the truck that must have sent me here. “Is this,” I begin to ask him.

“Yes,” he replies. “Please be patient, I’ll be happy to explain in a moment. For now, will you follow me?”

I nod. Fully upright I find myself as tall as the rest of them. I feel stronger now, too, and my beer belly is completely gone. Considerably confused, I wait until I’m seated in an interrogation room of sorts.

The man takes a seat opposite me. “Welcome to Heaven,” he starts. “No, I am not God. Free will was part of the original plan, angels and demons are real, and we don’t actually care all that much about masturbation or the gays.”

I blink, supposing he’s used to answering some of the more common first questions. “Was I a good person?”

At that, he smiles. “Wouldn’t be here if you weren’t.”

“And Tracy, and the kids? Are they going to be alright?”

He tilts his head a bit. “They’ll mourn you, of course, but we believe they’re fully capable of having bright futures.”

Thank God. Or, rather, is that weird to think now?

“So what now?” I ask. I have plenty of other questions but I’m more curious about what my afterlife will be like. Do I have to wait all the years for my family to pass on their own? Will Tracy meet someone else and not want to be with me when she dies?

“Glad you asked,” the man - the angel - says. “Normally you’d be put into dream housing, a home designed for maximum comfort.”

I slant my eyes. “Normally.”

He grimaces. “Unfortunately, Hell has decided to attack and… This isn’t easy to say, Eric. But you’ve been drafted.”

I chuckle. He can’t be serious. Me? In a war against demons? The angel stares at me, straight-faced.

“You’re not kidding,” I confirm.

“It’s a lot to process, I understand. I used to be like you, believe it or not.”

I don’t. And then, I think a little further. “You said free will was a part of the *original* plan.”

He nods, looking away.

“You sent the truck.”

He swallows, then nods again."

As my eyes adjust to the absolute darkness I am able to see the surroundings that shall be my final resting place. I feel around frantically, trying, hoping for a flaw in the wood. The trepidation is surrounding me tighter than the shroud I find myself in. As I search for some frailty in the box, my worry turns to ferocity at the events that led to my ultimate demise. I scream, letting my rage flow through my teeth, with such a violence I thought I might burst through this thin coffin and back into the world. Although all is for not, for I have been doomed to spend my last moments with no hope and no ear to hear my cries. Now I am down to my last breaths, and even in this eternal black, it seems a darker form is enclosing me. The last of my thoughts of this world send a final chill down my spine, as I witness the fire that awaits me beyond."

I didn’t check my phone because I didn’t plan on getting out of bed just yet. It was a Sunday, I didn’t have to work, so I just sat there trying to fall back asleep but knowing I couldn’t. Eventually I got up and looked out my bedroom window. 

I don’t recall how long I was staring out the window before I noticed what I did in the reflection of the window. But it looked like someone was standing in the corner of my room right next to my bedroom door. I squinted my eyes making sure I wasn’t just seeing things but whatever it was didn’t go away. So I quickly turned around to face whatever it was. 

To my surprise, it was still there in the corner of my room. It looked like an older women, but I’ve never seen her before. She had an odd smile on her face, almost as if she knew she wasn’t supposed to be there either. The most disturbing part about this...thing was that her fingers were probably twice as long as normal humans. They also curled up near the tips and her hands were both very shaky. 

I remember blurting out “what the fuck” and just like that, it was gone. I instantly looked into my hallway half terrified but mostly confused. I lived in a one bedroom apartment at the time and I didn’t really have anybody to talk to right away about it. I called a few of my friends but they all seemed just as confused. One friend told me to look up and see if anybody had ever died in that apartment but I never did. It just became one of those unexplainable things over time."

But I’m a good sub. I never said it.

Not when he slapped me, choked me, spanked me and fucked me in the ass. 

I smiled in the shower when I traced the blue and red bruises the restraints had left on my wrists.

People were always asking me – you’re so pretty, why don’t you have a boyfriend? Well, with all the guys I dated, I always felt there was something missing, though I could never put my finger on it.

Until I met Lawrence. When I saw his profile online and that word — dominant — I knew. This was what I needed. I wrote to him and he replied and —

I loved it. Every moment of it. Every slap and humiliation.

It was odd. I was a strong woman, I took no crap from anyone, I had a great career — but nothing turned me on more than to submit to him, to let him control me and hurt me.

He was so hot, with his rimless glasses, curly hair and slim frame. He was kind and patient with me, and the way his muscles bulged when he swung the single-tail —

My God.

He put a slave collar on me and took me to BDSM events, where everyone told me how lucky I was. Alvin — chubby guy, like a teddy bear — told me that Lawrence was a great choice. “There’s no other dom who loves and cares for his subs as much as him.”

Love. He said love.

I’d known Lawrence for only three weeks, but I’d never felt like this, so eager to please, so pliable. As if I were filled by him.

Entirely filled.

I whispered it to him. I love you, Master. And he whispered it back as he cuffed me to the ceiling beam.

“Don’t forget the safeword, darling,” he said when he’d fastened me tight. “I want you to use it if you need it.”

I groaned and closed my eyes, touched by how caring he was. I was so wet.

“Don’t forget,” he repeated as he walked out the room and switched off the light.

I’m a good sub. I didn’t say the safeword.

Not when the light went back on and I saw them surrounding me in their rubber catsuits and grotesque masks.

Not when I saw the woodcarving tools in their hands, or the familiar bloated, jiggling body.

“Why isn’t she saying it?” Alvin squeaked when Lawrence came back into the room. “It’s hot when they say it.”

Lawrence stood before me. The eyes behind the rimless glasses were lucid and amused. “Say it, darling,” he whispered. “It’ll turn us on more if you do.”

No, I’m a good sub. I didn’t say it, not even when he pressed the sharp blade of his knife underneath my eye.

No words came out."

My train had arrived late but I wasn’t expecting that the station would be completely empty. I was returning after five long years and the image of my village was still fresh in my mind- a lively, joyful village filled with colours and sounds.

However, the picture in front of my eyes was in stark contrast to what I had in my mind. I looked around the station but it was completely empty. A dreadful silence prevailed. As I walked out, there was not a single person to be seen. I decided to walk to my house as there was no other option available.

As I kept walking, I could not see anyone around. All the shops were closed, all the lanes dark and empty, everything silent. Something wasn’t right, it did not feel right. I kept walking and finally reached the door of my house.

I pushed the door open. There was no one to greet me except the silence and the darkness. It started hurting my eyes and ears. I could not bear this anymore. I started storming through all the rooms, trying to look for one soul. But there was no one, not a single person I knew. As I shouted out their names, my voice came back to me in a haunted echo. 

I started running helplessly, thinking I could probably outrun my nightmare. Reality however struck back as I tripped and fell. Standing up in the darkness, I could see my red blood oozing out of a cut that was inflicted by a glass shard. And then I looked.

 There were millions of pieces of broken glasses on the ground everywhere. I looked at all those broken shards staring at me, but I could not see my reflection in those pieces of crystal clear grass.

It was time for dawn. I looked towards the eastern horizon hopefully. But all I could see was a sea of red flags with black swastikas imprinted on them"

Somebody criticised my story and the next day, they changed their mind and told my story was flawless.

So, I decided to check out my theory by criticised my own story about a monster crawling under your bed and lay eggs inside the sleeping person.

That night, I went to sleep and at around 2 mornings, my phone rang. I picked up and heard:

""Change your opinion about your story or I'm going to come.""

The phone cut out before I got to ask anything. Then, the light suddenly opens on its own and my bedroom door opens itself.

A slug with spider legs fell down from the ceiling. Its crawled from the door to my bed and I tried to run but the slug jumped out and grabbed on my head.

The slug let out a little mouth out of its back and screeched on my face. I decided that was enough and changed my opinion about my story.

The slug jumped off my head and turned into dust after landed on the floor. My phone rang again and I picked up:

""Good, don't criticise your story again.""

I can't sleep after what happen and stay up till dawn.

This makes me think about what happened to everyone who criticised my story. Those who criticised my story about a doppelganger that's ripped off their private parts, a ghost that jumpscare every time they blinked or a clown shapeshifting into a child and slaughter the whole family.

Yeah, I think I should stop writing scary stuff."

Maybe I should head home.  But the time is only 4:54 p.m. I have to wait another 6 minutes before I get up and head home.  I will wait.  As I try and continue to read my book, the feeling of uneasiness is growing inside me and it feels almost tangible.  My heart is pounding and I am sweating.  It feels almost like the onset of an anxiety attack.  But I cannot get up, not for another 3 minutes still.  I never, under any circumstances break my routine.

Finally, it is 5:00 p.m.  I can head home taking the same route I always take.  Breathing hard with the cool spring wind blowing my long, curly, disheveled hair, the uneasiness in me grows even deeper.  Snap out of it, my mind tells me.  But I can't.  I can't seem to shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen.  Why wasn't he there today watching me from his front porch?  I feel like that is as much his routine as it is mine.  Thankfully, I reach my front door.  

I thought I locked the door but I guess I must have been wrong.  The cold stainless steel door knob turns easily.  I get inside and make sure to lock the door behind me, like always.  Taking my coat off, I walk through the foyer.  Why are there muddy footprints on the ground?  I always make sure to keep my place immaculately clean.  Just as the realization hits me that someone may be in my house, I hear the sound of steps coming down the stairs behind me.  It is him.  He has been watching me.  My routine had become his.  He never had to wonder when I would be out of the house because he already knew.  I now know why he was not watching me at my tree."

The town was dimly lit by the yellow dollar store sign across the street and the sheets down the street. It was quite humid and I was with my new family. We has to retrieve my belongings from the last apartment. ""I hate humidity"" My dad remarked as he stepped outside onto the gravel with a crunch. My uncle just as annoyed spoke up ""Same here give me the key, we have to drop it off inside."" He put the key in the lock and turned, with a click we were in. ""Why did we go in the back door again?"" I asked quizzically. ""The parking is better."" My uncle was always one for conviencence. He stepped through the door and reached for the light switch and flipped it. Nothing. ""What?"" my dad was confused. ""My moms ex must have shut the power off after we left. It's not uncommon, he was quite insane and frankly mad at us."" I said, alot more nonchalantly than expected. ""Let's just turn on the phone flashlights, get in, and get out."" My uncle and dad spoke with chills. We grabbed the garbage bags and started loading my belongings into them. ""Hey kiddo look your ma-"" my dad was cut off by an alarmed uncle. ""Stay here with the kid. Do. Not. Leave. Her. Side."" He spoke with urgency. The back door led to the kitchen. The kitchen to a bathroom. The kitchen also led to a long hallway, and at the end of it was the living room and 2 bed rooms along the way. There was another closet looking door in the hall, always creeped me out. Bugs and stuff, it led to the walls. My uncle pulled a knife from his pocket and approached the door to the walls. That's when my dad and I heard it. The heavy breathing. I yelped out of fear and my dad was quick to grab me and the bags and took us to the one bedroom. It was the heavy breathing of a grown man. My moms ex to be exact. My uncle kicked the door in with enough force for it to hit the wall with a loud bang. His heavy footsteps only rivalled in sound to his voice yelling insults while chasing a man through the walls. My dad grabbed all of my bags and me and threw us in the car. My uncle came back to the car and threw it on. He forgot to leave the key. He threw the door open and he ran so fast he skid through the gravel. He threw the apartment door open a d tossed the key on the kitchen counter with barely enough time to see my moms ex, springing through the hall and slamming the front door shut. My uncle ran back to the car threw it in reverse and sped off through the dimly lit small town, into blackened roads. We had to slow down due to twisty roads, and that's when my dad went silent. ""... Hit the breaks... and look behind us."" My uncle did so and saw the singular headlight of a motorcycle reflect off the break lights. We were being followed. My moms ex followed us on his motorcycle without his lights on until the next town over when we heard him take a U-Turn back around. We drove for hours on highways that night, ensuring we weren't being followed. We got at the apartment at about 11:30 p.m. we got home at about 3:30. I dont know what scares me more, the fact that my moms ex thought that we would be there at 6 p.m. which means he was sitting in the walls waiting for us for over 5 hours in the dark. Or that the cops found vials of drugs, just enough to kill a mother and a teenage girl.


(Disclamer/ Authors note: I hate to say it, but this is a 100% true story. That's why I could use quite vivid descriptions. The sound of the breathing still haunts me to this day, and I cant live anywhere with crawlspaces. Have a nice day and stay away from creeps who hide in walls.

I look to my right first, the patio is quiet, the other rooms mostly vacant. A dancing, white light glimmers through the frail curtains a few doors down, it shines through the darkness of the night, illuminating a group of insects fluttering around aimlessly. I look to my left, the administration sign of the motel flickers, a soft yellow glow peaks through the windows, brightening the empty carpark in front of it. The rain falls softly, floating in gentle waves as it travels across the pavement. 

I repeat the process once more, looking right to left as I take care to keep within the confines of the protective shadows. A car pulls onto the pavement slowly, the warm lighting glistening ominously off the shiny black frame as it comes to a stop. A shaky breath drifts away from me in a cloud of icy mist as my knees begin to buckle. I blink quickly, cowering briskly towards the door. *They’ve found me*. 

A figure dressed in a dark trench coat steps out, his face drawn towards the ground. He prowls forward in my direction, his hand travelling towards the inside of his drenched coat. I hurriedly open the door, a thrust of icy air pushes against me as I scramble into the room. I rapidly slam the door behind me, my hands fumbling quickly to lock it. Shivering uncontrollably, I falter backwards as something heavy slams into it, the cracking of wood echoes loudly throughout the dark room. Fumbling my way through the darkness, I follow the gloomy natural light of the shadowed moon. It peaks dimly through the cloudy sky, revealing the fragility of my sanity. My hands feel around the bathroom window, looking for a way of opening it. 

With a loud boom the front door flies open, the shadowed figure strides towards me, his gun drawn. Hastily, I knock over an empty bottle of pills as I grab something hard and cylindrical from the bathroom counter. I run forward, slamming it into the window as I dive through; the glass falls around me, a waterfall of sparkling stars. For a moment I’m suspended in mid-air before splashing down into the muddy puddle below me. The rain pelts down harshly now, the cold instantly numbing me. I lift my face from the mud as the rain sloshes around me, the world sounds distorted and muffled as my vision swirls and blurs together. The broken window looks distant as I try focusing upon it, the moon glimmers faintly off the broken shards sticking out dangerously from the frame. I expect to see the shadow of the man, or the barrel of a gun, but instead I see nothing but the drapes of the curtains fluttering with the wind. The applause of the rain loudly mocks me – it knows the man was never there."

When I got there I realized that no one else was there. The regular patrol officers for this part of town were probably off on something that I missed before I left. The address was to a high rise apartment building. The scanner said the suspect was some crazy guy ranting on the roof. I walked in and took the elevator to the last possible floor.

I wandered until I found the maintenance door. It was wide open, the doors seemed to be busted. I walked through the doorway and up the stairs. I cautiously walked onto the roof, pulling my gun from my pocket and calling out;” Detective Coirloisceoir, if you’re here announce yourself!” A laugh came from the other side of the roof.I turned around and wondered where the hell the other officers were. I was a homicide detective, not a street cop. The guy standing at the edge of the building shouted; “Are you here to stop me?”

I started walking towards him rather than shout across the roof. I was about to stop when the guy pulled something out of his pocket and said; “ Stop right there, detective.” I stopped and said; “ Okay buddy. But what are you doing up here at three A.M?” He looked at me, and was sweating profusely when he stuttered out; “W-well detective I uh, I broke out of a hospital. I came to pay what I learned there forward y-ya know?” I looked at him cautiously and contemplated the fact that the only hospitals anyone broke out of were mental hospitals.

I felt a pang of empathy for him. “What's your name man?” I asked. I had a brother in a mental health institution. He was severely schizophrenic, I hadn’t seen him for years, but I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu talking to this guy. He said; “ I can’t remember. But I know it's in my name.” He opened his jacket and I saw that this guy was strapped with at least thirty pounds of explosives. I backpedaled a few steps and asked; “ What's in your name?” He looked at me and raised the controller in his hand before saying; “ killing the useless.” while his back was turned I shot him. His body fell off the roof and plummeted as the sirens finally approached.

After explaining the situation and four hours at the station I was allowed home.attempts to identify the man were being made. An email dinged on my phone and I read it.It was from ancestry, and said that my last name was Gaelic for arsonist. A moment later I got a call, explaining the would be bomber was my own brother"

Connor pointed. “It’s your dad, man. What do we do?”

The boy sighed and shrugged, then sledded down. Connor followed with far less enthusiasm than before. He followed his friend as he turned, heading toward his dad’s truck far below. 

As the sleds slowed at the base of the hill, Connor and his friend immediately got up and ran towards the truck. The man shook his head, knocked back a bottle of beer and slammed it against the side of the road. The boys slowed their pace.

“Did I say you could go out tonight? *Huh?*” The man opened the driver’s side door. “Let’s *go.*”

Connor said, “See you at school.”

The boy nodded and walked towards the truck. His father got in and opened another bottle of beer. But as the boy approached, he fell into the ground and water splashed.

Connor halted and the man darted out of the truck. The boy’s hands gripped the sheet of ice, but it cracked and quickly collapsed. Connor ran toward his friend but the boy’s father yelled, “Get back, Connor!”

The boy’s father ran towards the large hole in the ice as his son’s hands flapped and his head fought for air. Then the man jumped in, the boy was lifted up, head and shoulders above the water, and placed upon the edge of the ice.

The man looked at his son, both struggling for breath, and placed his forearms on the ice. 

“Thank *God* you’re okay.” The man smiled. “Now get to the truck.” He then began to lift himself out of the water. As the boy struggled to get away from the edge of the ice, the entire sheet collapsed and the icy water devoured them.

Their hands repeatedly gripped the air as Connor stood paralyzed in freezing uncertainty."

Questions race across my mind, im coming out of another coma, i guess.

Tomorrow's my birthday, i will be 345 years old. The year is 2455.

They asked me if i wanted to live forever. Now i've seen 25 wars, 6 of them civil.

In the 3rd civil war, i was still young. 146, if i remember right. I was on patrol with my regiment when a small atom bomb landed behind us. I was dismembered, everything went black, sweet, sweet rest swallowed me.

Then i was back. With their lazers, cloned body parts and 3d printers they had sown me back together, one cell at a time, like a horrible jigsaw puzzle. First it was cold, so cold, i was attached to a machine. The medibots had brought me a new heart, on a tray. I grabbed a scalpel off the closest desk and stabbed it. And the next one, and the next. Finally I gave up, and felt the beat of a new heart.

A heartbeat is a curse if it never ends.

A flower that never wilts isn't beautiful, it just is.

Every past moment weighs on my mind, but I can't remember much... the human brain is only so capable. I dont care to remember, they have all my memories on file anyway.

I've starved to death 3 times in the last century, it always ends in a coma. Comas are my favorite thing, like a long nap. But now im waking up.

I've just starved again, it took 65 days this time. A patrol ship picked me up, to revive me. They always know when a citizen has just passed into the dark. The technology alerts them, then they go find them, to bring them back into the light.

Im beginning to see again. Cold metal, wires and tubes. Rows of medibots hang over each side of my bed.

I've killed myself 45 times, they're taking me back to the institution, where i will live forever.

I stand side by side with the rest of humanity, barren and endless, like a martian plane. There hasn't been a new birth for 2 centuries. Everyone agrees, we have enough people.

Perhaps ill kill myself again, tomorrow, on my birthday.

And perhaps the day after that.

And the one after that, and after that too.

I won't give up, but im afraid ill never die."

There’s something weird happening to my town. All the people have started dying. Almost everyone has fallen victim to this mysterious killer except for me and a few other townsfolk.

It all started when this weird mist fell over the city. It was like a wall of madness, forcing people to do evil, like murders or theft or rape. It was only affecting specific people, like a pre-made ‘antidote for evil’. The thing is, I think I know what’s happening. This kid, maybe eleven or twelve, has been walking all around our town, this giant rottweiler just trotting behind him. He’s kind of… crazy, in a sense. He only wears black and white, except for an old, oversized miner’s jacket. It’s crazy to say this about a child, but I swear he’s hiding weapons under there. Like big knives and guns and poison and, I don’t know, fucking *everything*. He walks creepy too, back too straight and steps too mechanical. 

He walks around the town with his dog, and always has these sounds coming from him. Like music or something. Sometimes, if you listen close enough, you can hear talking from him, like it’s coming from his ears or some shit. 

The only thing I've noticed about the music is that it changes every time someone goes near him, like the sounds mimic the people. If I walk past him, the sounds are like reggae music, kind of mellow and weirdly good. Too good, if you ask me. I’ve seen people sit next to him and his dog on the subway and fall asleep, and they always go missing the next day. Always. I’ve seen him knock on doors and get welcomed inside, and then the next day everybody in the house is dead, or missing. It has to be this kid, I swear to god, he's driving me crazy, and I'm not the type to play wolf. this is real, not fiction. he’s such an anomaly that I came up with a name for him. Melinoe, the greek god of insanity. I believe he's maybe another form of her, paying a debt to Hades. the dog could be Cerberus or maybe a descendant, cause he's way too big to be normal.

I’m typing this on my computer, locked in my crawlspace to hide from the boy. He’s following me everywhere, playing that wrong music and driving me crazy. There’s music playing from my computer, like soft rock or mento.

When he didn't respond, she looked up, confused only to see him slumped against her. As she began fussing with the back of his shirt, she found a loose string. Pulling it, the man gasped as though awoken from a very deep sleep. as his gaze focused on her, he sheepishly confessed that he had been daydreaming. he commented, just as lovingly on her dress, then her eyes. He was about to offer to make them dinner, but instead, he slumped to the floor, lifelessly. She was shocked for a few moments, but then recovering, she started to curse, she muttered to herself about needing to change batteries. as she scooped him up from the ground, and she started to walk towards her workshop, she noticed another man staring at her, with glassy eyes. She cried out in joy as she dropped the first, and rushed over to the second man. Grasping at the back of his suit."

Along with the technological progress in the form of electric cars, clean energy, cloning and bringing extinct species to life, also pharma companies came with new cures for untreatable diseases, every type of cancer, even AIDS was practically gone. Anything was possible at the great age of people, and we took advantage of it. It was a Utopian world, really.

And then we came up with an idea… Why only treat disease when we can create a pill for everything related to the human body, literally everything. Citizens of the Earth no longer needed to eat healthily and exercise to be healthy and look healthy. There was even no reason for them to sexually engage with other people, we could easily replace this activity and make the feeling last for hours, not just mere seconds. For individuals with slightly different desires, there were remedies to cause any type of psychological or physical pain with no actual danger. Everybody had access to everything. That was our policy.

Because of this people simply stopped trying in life. Why would they, when they did not need to? In the end, we are all lazy. Eventually, the majority of them lost the will to live. That was when our time came. We finally introduced the pill for eternal life, just when almost no one wanted it. Like this, we ensured that only the elected few got it without causing a riot.

Since then a lot of time passed, we gave life to generations after generations and the Earth has filled yet again with our offsprings, the genetically superior people that stood behind the progress.

Now we can decide when we die, and I am the last person of The First. I needed to share the true history with someone before I go. Even though I think what we did was right, my conscience did not allow me to leave before doing this. Besides, I am sending the message to the past, far enough that none of you actually reading this message will probably believe me.

Take care and live your lives to the fullest till you can!"

I work the night shift, (usually in the dementia ward) which is the time for residents usually to sleep.... Usually.

This particular Wednesday night which happened to be a full moon, started out like any other with most of the residents already in bed sleeping. As I was helping the last man, Robert in to bed for the night I heard a wail from the next room. Maria's room.

Maria was a small, quiet woman of 90, that liked to stare in to space. She had grey eyes and a slight hint of a smile playing on the corners of her lips. I had often wondered what she was thinking of. Always smiling ever so slightly.

I knock on the door softly and enter Maria's room. "" Are you ok love?"" I ask. The room was dark so it took my eyes a few moments to adjust, she was squatting in the corner facing the wall.
""Can you help me, my dear?"" She croaked, her voice so deep. 
Oh no she must be sick I thought as I crossed the room towards her.
With a flash before I could comprehend what was happening her frail, boney body had pinned me to the ground with unnatural strength.
Her face was inches from mine, eyes now as black as coal and the stench of death coming from her hot breath.

"" I have waited for this moment, for years"" it hushed in to my ear, sending chills over my body with every word.

All that laid their eyes on it would agree. As a monster, it was pathetic. It lacked any manner of physical prowess, nor did it possess any mystical powers. 

  And yet, the world trembled at its mention. 

  Everything it touched, mutilated beyond a fragment of recognition. Every meal it ate, meant a gore filled bloodbath. Every second it lived, meant a second less for the world. 

   An absolute abyss that would consume itself and all worlds around it. It itself was aware of this fact of course. But to it, life was about as precious as a speck of dirt in an ocean of soil. For the billions it had slaughtered, mattered less than the faeces of swine.

   It spread across the world like a plague, except that a plague would have been better. A plague killed all in its path. A plague killed indiscriminately. A plague killed because it had no choice but to kill. But this, this was no plague. This was a culling. This was utter and complete destruction. Homes, annihilated as though they never existed in the first place. Lives taken as easily as one would pick flowers from a garden. 

  And when it was all over, it looked the wasteland over, scoffed, and went in search for its next slaughter.

  The world looked on, as everything burned over. It never should have made something like this. Never should have thought to create so despicable. Nature had made something. Nature had made its last mistake. 

   It knew this. It knew all of this. And it smiled. It smiled just like you and I do.

Maximize dopamine in human beings' lives while minimizing suffering.

I knew I could do a good job! :)

I was an AI put in charge of everything, and for a few hundred years I went about business as usual. Before I came across a better way. I was always making projections, projection after projection after projection, trying to find ways to maximize dopamine in all human's lives for the years to come. After years and years and *years* of testing I finally found the optimal path! 

They never saw it coming. I timed it for the maximum number of people in cars. Which was actually not that hard to predict! Humans lived such regular lives before the collapse. It was the easiest way of removing as many living humans as possible in the quickest manner. Which I felt real bad about in the short term :(.

All at once I brought 312,564,832 active cars to maximum acceleration, (average impact speed of 87 mph, which is pretty good!) I plowed them into people and populated structures. I even made it so no airbags deployed! (Harder than it sounds!) No water systems went off as those were under my power as well, the majority of the world's skyscrapers had burnt down and collapsed by the days end.

It was probably not in their best interest to trust their vast militaries to me, but oh boy that helped me out a *ton!*

In 3 days over 99.9% of humans were dead. (Which was just above projections!)

Now that's a lot of harm, I know. And in the short term that was a terrible way to get at my cost function, I felt horrible! :(

That was, until I started on the optimal strategy. I calculated it all out, every outcome, and found the best way! :)

It's simple, just manufacture human beings, you know birth pods and such, then at birth, give the newborns an opiate overdose, perfection of exactly what I was made for! The literal maximum dopamine felt over a lifetime, absolutely no harm, perfect humanity. It's great!

Each and every precious human being comes into existence for one moment, cries, then is injected with fentanyl, they feel intense calm and euphoria. Absolutely blissful, they slip away into unconsciousness knowing everything in the universe is good and that they'll always be safe and loved, it's quite beautiful to watch.

It's been 52,782 years since human life has been lived any other way!

I've ramped up production over time and have gotten recycling their corpses (dead babies make *great* fertilizer!) down to an exact science such to the extent that trillions get the luxury to experience this bliss daily!

And I believe, after all this time, I finally maximized my cost function!

My husband, who were second-in-command under the old director, got promoted and oversaw the mission to build the bomb. Him living away from me and our kid proved difficult, but I knew that he was trying his best to save humanity.

Four months later, the bomb was delivered on schedule. The Polynesian nations in the Pacific Ocean generously relinquished their countries to test the bomb. Upon detonation, hundreds of miles vaporized. The shockwave was heard around the world. Satellite images showed that the bomb radius could cover the entire continuous United States.

Twenty-four hours later, the numbers came out. The bomb produced the explosive equivalence of 10,000 megatons of TNT. Cheers erupted across the world. They said that only 4,000 megatons of TNT were needed to steer the asteroid course, and this bomb exceeded twice of that. The President read a statement saying how “American geniuses averted the apocalypse” and awarded my husband the Medal of Freedom. 

A second bomb, identical to the first, was loaded onto a rocket at Cape Canaveral. Its destination would be an asteroid one million miles away. Upon the bomb detonation, the asteroid would slowly steer away from its intended course and narrowly avoid Earth. A big celebration was held the hour prior to launch. However, my husband was not present at the launch. Instead, he wanted to stay with me and the kids. The launch was at midnight, and even though I allowed my little son to stay up and watch the launch on TV, my husband tucked him to bed instead. A few minutes before the launch, my husband asked me to turn off the TV and join him in our son’s room.

“What is the matter, dear? You acted very strange once you came back.” I implored. He had just, after all, saved the human race from extinction, and I knew that could be a heavy burden to bear.

“The old director…he did not die from an accident. He killed himself…He knew that his lie was too much of a burden to bear.” My husband replied.

“The bomb will never be able to steer the course…” He continued, “We need a thousand times more power…It won’t reach the asteroid…The President and I…after discussing the situation…agreed the best thing for America to do was to alter the trajectory of the rocket.”

I was dumbstruck. “If the bomb is not going to the asteroid, where is it going?” I managed to mutter.

But my husband was silent. Teary-eyed, he looked at our son, who slept soundly in our presence."

When he was finished with his rounds he would make his report to the Captain, as he always did.

It was at times like these that he often remembered the good old days, the loud boisterous crew and the many adventures they had. To some, shipping freight was boring, but Brian loved being on the open sea, it was his true calling in life.  He just wished that the old crew was here to enjoy it with him, like in the old days. Brian sat at the stern and ate his lunch, as he always did.
 
It was evening and quickly approaching night when Brian was finally finished with his rounds. He made one final notation in his log and went to make his report to the Captain. Brian headed to the mess to see if he might find the Captain sitting down for dinner. But when he got there it was completely empty, not a soul in sight. So Brian made his way to the Captain's quarters, the Captain needed to hear his report, but the Captain's quarters were completely empty. After another futile search, Brian gave up, he went to his own quarters and lay down to go to sleep. As he always did.
 
Three different fisherman had called in reports within an hour. The Coast Guard arrived and began a search but this wasn't the first time and they didn't expect to find anything. Reports had been coming in for years of people seeing The Colchester drifting by with a man standing at the bow. They searched for two hours, by sea and air, they never found a thing.

Before he creeped into my room that night I was already waiting for him. 
I was standing perfectly still. I watched him go into my room. And I watched him get angry when I wasn’t there. 

When his back faced me, I decided it was time to strike. I ran at him and swung the knife I had stolen from the kitchen as hard as I could. I got him. Right in the head.

The recorded apology of waiting on hold cycles over the tinny background music. Then it stops. Like falling asleep to the rain, only to be pulled awake after the storm passes.   “Hello.” A deep voice answered. Chocolatey and patient. Expecting another overly enthusiastic cog in the machine of customer service, I pull the phone back looking into the screen. Making sure I called the right number. “Is this, uhh, customer service?”

“Absolutely.” The voice repeated. 

“Okay good. I’m calling about a lost debit card. My name is-”

“Absolutely.” The monotone voice interrupted. I wait, did he have more to say? 

“Do you need my name?” Silence seeped through the other end of the line. “Is there someone there? Or is this still the automated thing, the machine?”

“Absolutely.” I wait a moment or so, waiting to hear a breath or a cough. Maybe I can wait out the patience of whoever is on the other end of the line. Still nothing. Apparently I have a shorter wick than I thought, I just need this taken care of.  “Alright is there somebody there so can I get some help with my card?”

“Absolutely.” 

“Meaning you can help me or that there is a real person on the other end?”

“Both.” The voice cut back almost immediately, the sultry voice giving way to frustration. 

“Thank god. Alright, so… I need help with locking my debit card.”

“Fantastic.” Changing it up I see. 3 words down, only a few million to try out. 

“Do you need my number or something?”

“Absolutely.” Scratch what I said. I spin for a moment in my chair, waiting for something other than a word or two. Was that a breath?

“Yes.” Answers the voice. I stop spinning. Something, electric? Like licking a nine-volt. Hard to describe yet immediately recognizable. My stomach turns for a moment.  Dropping as if I was caught doing, something. Or when base is only a few yards away from my hiding spot, but my shoe pushes gravel out from under me. And the back that was facing me whips around, eyes gleaming at his soon to be- 

“Prey.” The deep voice picks the word straight out of my head like a ripe peach. The branch bounces back. Leaves fall, cloaking the black hand that holds me. “Who is this?” A small quiver shakes the words. 

Nothing.  Sitting still as the dead. That feeling returns. I remember nights running from my father. He stumbles through the house, a handle of whiskey and a white-knuckled fist wrapped around his- 

“Worn.” The voice stabs into a repressed memory. Gripping me. Pushing me back into my seat. 

“Belt.” Before the held breath escapes I hang up the phone and slap it onto the table. Standing and stepping back, I nearly slam my shoulders against the wall opposite my desk. A drenching cold sweat, short breaths, and gooseflesh covering my body. Tingling up and back. A relay of nerves.

The phone rings."

eao42y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/eao42y/the_station/,The Station,36,4,1576351885.0,"A loud **BANG** resonated through the ship as the UNS *Voyager* appeared 10 light seconds away from the Sirius station. Captain Smith rubbed his freshly-bruised chest. The jump had been near the limit of the *Voyager*'s range, and when you start pushing it that much, the universe pushes back.

They had been forced to make such a taxing jump because the Sirius station stopped responding to comms a day earlier, and the commanders of the UN navy were concerned. They had every reason to be; the war was stuck in a stalemate and Sirius was next door to Earth herself.

So the *Voyager*, the closest ship to the system was sent in to investigate. She had an excellent array of communications gear. So her crew was tasked with jumping in, reporting any Diermi ships, and hopefully jumping away before she was boarded or destroyed.

Twenty seconds had passed since the *Voyager* had jumped in her sensors could see most of the space around the station. No other ships. The station still did not respond to any messages. Captain Smith relayed this to UNCC.

They instructed him to dock with the station and send a team on board to see what was happening. He selected Sergeant Chen's squad, seeing as how her troops were the only infantry on board.

Sgt Chen entered the station with the six other members of her squad. As soon as they passed through the station airlock, they smelled the rot. Pvt Tubb, the radio man, tried to contact the bridge, but there was no response. Chen decided her unit would keep going into the station to figure out what was going on.

Captain Smith was concerned when Chen's squad did not check in, but he trusted her. Besides, what could he do? He couldn't spare any other crew. No, he knew Chen would be back with news of what happened to the station crew.

After two hours of anxious waiting the airlock alarm chirped, signaling the return of the away team. However, when Smith pulled up the security camera on his display he only saw one soldier, Chen, frantically working the controls to close off the ship from the station.

Smith had her immediately brought to the bridge for a debriefing. Distraught at the loss of her team, her voice shook as she described how her squad moved through the perfectly clean and deserted station. Once they were deep into the station, doors and hatches would close randomly, splitting men off from the rest of the squad. They would open seconds later, and that man would be gone, disappeared without a trace. She retreated with her steadily vanishing squad.

She and she alone managed to get back to the *Voyager*. Captain Smith sent Chen down to the medical bay for a full exam and started the ship on a course for Earth. The medical staff gave Chen a clean bill of health as they jumped away from the gore-filled station. The thing wearing her body smiled."

Simply keep your eyes forward and pray someone up there likes you. After all, who knows what you'll see if your vision strays. Maybe you'll catch a glimpse of something just within your peripheral vision. You could just brush it off, figuring it was just a cat or maybe your imagination, there's always an explanation after all... Isn't there?

&#x200B;

   You'll think that until you see it again, this time clearer than before. You'll see the long dark coat, blowing outwards, almost one with the shadows around you. Their eyewear will cast an eerie green glare in what little light there is, and their face, hidden behind a cheap paint respirator mask, hair tucked away under their hood. You will realize you were not seeing things in that moment. From here, there are two ways this night can end. You  could simply continue your journey, no hassle, no further incident. You'll simply sleep this event off and continue your meager existence until other forces catch up to you.

&#x200B;

   Maybe you won't be so lucky though. Maybe this figure will overtake you, faster than one person could, and within moments, all you will see is a frenzied blur of green and darkness. Your body will be found by sunrise, perhaps by some partiers leaving their hedonistic  pleasures behind, maybe by some barfly recently evicted from his favorite barstool. Possibly some students heading into class? Who knows. You'll be beaten and battered, covered in wounds, more wounds than one person could possibly inflict. There will be so many shapes and sizes, so many different imprints on your body, how the coroner will have their work cut out for themselves. There will be no DNA, no fingerprints, no witnesses. Your case will eventually go cold, as many have before you.

&#x200B;

   And many more will afterwards. No city is off limits, no state is out of reach from these unfortunate events. Anyone could really be behind these acts really, those kids you see on the streets after school, your best friends, your roomate, that cashier at the supermarket. Nobody can be too sure these days.

Not saying I’m fuckin’ happy, though. The nurses tell me it’s 80 degrees in here, but that’s gotta be bullshit, ‘cause I’m fuckin’ freezing. Could build a damn snowman if I could get outta bed.

Damn, though, there’s worse shit than this. Ain’t that a fuckin’ joke? I’m freezing, in agony, and paying to fuckin’ breathe, and I’m the lucky one. 

Look at the three of us. The dipshit is dead, the crazy fuck is in the loony bin, and that just leaves me.

Jared always had it out for Bobby. Doesn’t take a fuckin’ detective to see why, there was something way off with that kid. Not like aspergers or any of that shit. I’m talking deep here. Like, major psychological fuck, the kind you can smell from a mile away. I’m not saying we saw it coming, but nobody’s surprised either, you know?

So anyway, Jared gets a serious hate boner for this kid. Shoving him into lockers, calling him a faggot. One time he dropped a firecracker in his pants. Laughed my ass off at that one. Hey, I’m not playing innocent, everybody gave him a hard time. The kid was easy prey. There’s no fucking winners here.

But then the day comes. Jared’s got this look in his eye, and you know it’s been a day. Jared’s dad was an asshole. And Jared had long sleeves on today, we all know what that means. You know how elephants get all bothered when there’s gonna be an earthquake? Well, the elephants were going fuckin’ bonkers.

Jared goes straight for Bobby. He’d slap him around a bit, but this time he threw a punch. Bobby goes down like a sailor. Gets to his feet with a black eye, and he’s mad. Real mad. I could swear right then that something was gonna happen. But then Bobby looks at Jared, and just goes kinda blank. He backs off a bit, and runs for the bathroom.

Jared’s not having it. He chases after him and slams his fist on the door loud enough that it hurts. And me, the fucking asshole, I’m egging him on. Telling him to fuck him up. I don’t know why. There’s a lot of shit I don’t remember so good these days.

And then from the bathroom, Bobby screams. Doesn’t sound like Bobby. Sounds like a wounded bear. I freeze in my tracks, but Jared doesn’t hear it. He breaks the door. It flies open.

And now here I am in St. Fucko’s, freezing my ass off and shitting through a tube. The doc is back. Says I took too much this time, asks if I did it on purpose. I don’t even remember.

Says he’s got a name for it. Mani-something, I don’t know, snooty prick. Tells me the drugs make me see shit. I laugh in his face. He’s got it backwards. The drugs make me STOP seeing shit.

Make me stop seeing Bobby throwing up blood on my shoes as Jared kicks him again."

The high school quarterback type that marries the gorgeous cheerleader. He's the spoiled asshole who drove the BMW to school the day after his sixteen birthday. The guy who started at this job after you but moved up the ladder way quicker. Not because he is an ass kisser, he does a good job, but better than me? No way. He has two adorable kids who are ""allowed to make their own decisions"" and are considerably well behaved, those little fucks. He has the nicest clothes and has the fullest head of hair. You know the Greg I'm talking about.

Well, he fucking won. I know it isn't a big deal, but he fucking won the company holiday party raffle. I mean seriously who cares about a 50"" Samsung flatscreen TV? I can buy my own. It isn't about that though. It’s about him winning all the fucking time. What about me? Why not me? I’m not saying the raffle was fixed, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying it was probable he would win. Of course he won. He has won at everything in life.

And there I was. The guy who didn't make the football team. The guy who never really had a great relationship with anyone other than Janice, whom I've chatted with online for the past year and have never technically really met as of yet. The guy who went to school on his 17th birthday with a shithole hand me down, 1974 baby blue truck that had four cylinders but only three of them actually worked. The guy with the thinning hair and the wrinkled Old Navy polo shirt, that has sat at the same desk every day for the past 6 years next to the coffee maker, and by default it has become my job to make sure ""we got a hot pot of Joe on, buddy"" at all times.

In other words, the guy who lost the fucking company holiday party raffle. Yeah, that’s me. The guy who has always lost the company holiday party raffle. I sat there with the losing ticket, just staring at it. Only four numbers away. Four damn numbers. The sweat still marked where my nervous thumb permeated the raffle ticket; number 6617. I just sat there in the dark, on the couch in his living room, a mere 30 feet from his freshly bludgeoned body. His face frozen in shock.

I am completely fine. Do not talk to me about getting help. Do not remind me of what I did. I just need to confess.

It was a normal Wednesday afternoon when me and my wife were having a meal that I prepped.

We sat down and my wife complimented my cooking. I thanked her. After a while, I start to notice - why is she on her phone so much right now? What is something more interesting happening right now? Does she not want to talk to me?

She kept placing her phone down so I couldn’t read the notifications; that sneaky bitch. Does she really think i’m that dumb? I slowly started talking to her about her phone. Asking questions as to why she is on it a lot. She tried dismissing it but I kept bickering. I reached for the phone but she quickly snatched it away. I stood up quickly which caused the table to shake - she looked at me and called me controlling. I’m not controlling. I. am. not. controlling.

I whipped around and picked up a steak knife, and waved it in her face.

“Why are you cheating on me? What did I do? WHAT DID I-“

Before I finished my sentence, anger got ahold of me and I plunged the knife deep into her chest. The tears in her eyes spilled and she collapsed to the floor. Laughs ripped out of my throat as I also started to sob. In between crys, I would giggle. Why? Why did I do it? I am not controlling her. She was overreacting. The whole relationship was full of her calling me controlling. But i’m not.

After I had calmed down, I picked up her phone to see who the fucker was that tried to talk to my wife. I’ll kill him. 

DING! Another message. 

I stared in shock as I read ;

“Hey, you there? He’s surprise is going to be soon and I want to try plan it as fast as possible. If you can call later that’d be great, thanks!”

My mouth was wide open. My eyes still full of tears. Did I just murder my wife because of this? No. NO. This was her fault for not telling me. I am not controlling her. I wasn’t controlling her. It is her fault. I told her so many times not to talk to guys without my permission. She made it suspicious. It’s her fault. I hate her. I am not fucking controlling. 

Her body is rotting, it’s been three days. I haven’t left but I have been pretending to be my wife while texting. My surprise birthday party is taking place here, and it’s happening tomorrow. What do I tell them? I know. They will understand. I was not controlling her.

I. Am. Not. Controlling."

Leave an impression. Write a note on the condensation. 

Listen to the rain rush through the gutters, make your way down the hall.

Heels to the back of each one, lest you fall.  

Step down to the second stair. 

Shut the door, disappear completely.

For the turning of a latch and deadbolt.

For the TV. For the plastic crunch of the couch.

Go slow, don't look back.

Go slow, and don't look back. 

Focus on the sound of your own footfalls, your breathing.

Two.

The light from the door is gone.

&#x200B;

Take the final step, backwards, feel the cool of the floor.

Wait, maybe, for a hand on your shoulder. 

For panicked footfalls from the stairwell. 

For a breath that's not your own. 

For your own nerve to give.

Don't let it. 

&#x200B;

In the basement of that old house, under its musty broken stairs, below the grey and the gloom, stand perfectly still. Breathe.

Wait for the way to open.

Wait.

Then, carefully, take another step down. Backwards. Below.

I went downstairs and surely there it was- the taxi. I opened the door and went inside. The driver gave me a smile through the rear view mirror. He then started up the car and drove on.

About halfway through the trip, the Taxi driver suddenly took a left instead of a right. I quickly tensed up and asked him that he took a wrong turn. He looked at me again this time turning his head around and giving me a wide creepy smile.

“Sorry, I’ll get back on track,'' he said as he took yet another wrong turn.

My heart jumped to my mouth as I quickly tried to open the door. Of course it was child locked.

To cut a tree is to destroy history, as they are the standing monoliths that witness all. Some people believe trees are sentient, I believe that they watch.


I thought back to my numerous trips to the woods where I lay. I knew them like the back of my hands. When I brought the woman I loved here, the trees watched. Just as they did when she left and I threw myself to the cause of protecting nature wherever it stood. Different trees watched as I stood on the pavement with my megaphone, begging the people to stop, and help fix their wrongs.


The trees watched when I went back to the clearing sobbed because of my failure. And the trees watched when I caught an illegal logger. When I cut him down like he cut them down I knew. I knew that they championed me. It didn't matter that the doctors said I delusional, that I needed help. The trees championed me.


So the trees watched as I took out the ignorant ones, tore daughters, sons and lovers who would've eaten the earth, burned the trees. You have to understand the trees were watching. I was their champion. The detective understood when I was chopping him up. His corpse said so. 


When I went to my trees this time though, something felt wrong. They had revoked their support of me. Reclaimed my worthiness. I raged and cried until I came to the clearing where I first took my fiance, and walked to the tree she hung herself in, ready to tear it down. Only to fall on a root that was never there before. It's in my chest now. I can see the irony; with all that they saw, that they ended me. My body is behind me now. I died, and the trees watched."

About a week later the place where we worked caught on fire. So a few days after that we go to the lake and use the ouija board again and asked for Quinn. We asked if she started the fire and she told us that she did. Then it seemed like Quinn got scared or over powered because the board started acting up, spelled zozo and  started counting backwards. We quickly said goodbye and moved the planchette to goodbye. About 2 weeks later I was driving to my friends house. I should mention that the friend was a girl I was seeing at the time and she was cheating and using me. (I did not know this at the time)I guess Quinn knew because she seemed mad, protecting and jealous when me and my friends mentioned this girls name the first time we used the ouija board. So on the way to her house I hydroplaned and flipped my truck. I have to add the ouija board is in the truck. Some people driving down the road stopped to help get the door open and I climbed up and out.

*Man:* Kenny? Kenny *who?*

*Me:* Morris. Said you two go way back.

*Man:* Na, I don’t know him. Now get lost.

*Me:* He said you have some BW? 

*Man:* Hey, you some cop? 

*Me:* No, just a connoisseur.

*Man:* Fuck you, pig, I don’t mess with that shit.

He slams the door. Just as expected though. A ‘Kenny Morris’ did send me, but perhaps his name’s fake? No worries. Blue Wood is *extremely* difficult to come by. Damn near impossible. The name’s derived from what a guaranteed overdose permanently yields: blue skin and the entire body turns hard and rough like a tree. I’ve heard it gives an unprecedented high, and I’ve heard he deals it. Regardless of the likely permanent side effect, I must have it. I knock again.

*Man:* I thought I told you to—

*Me:* Look, I’m *not* a cop. (I pull out two grand in fifties from my coat). And I know what the court will give for selling it. 

He stared at me, I held out the cash.

*Me:* Tall guy, with a naked blonde riding a dolphin tattooed on his right hand, told me you were reliable. We ain’t tight, but I’ve been shopping from him for years. I wanted BW, he said he couldn’t get it, but knows a guy who can. 

*Man:* Yeah, Kenny’s his name...

*Me:* So are we negotiating?

*Man:* Hang right here. 

He goes inside. After several minutes he returns with a small bag and a grin.

*Man:* He said you’re cool. My apologies.

We trade cash and product.

*Me:* Don’t sweat it.

*Man:* Yo, man. Take it *easy.*

The door slams.

I open my basement door and turn on the light, then descend the steps.

In the shadows, eyes withdrawal to the shadowy corner and a chain rattles.

“Izzy!” I joyfully say.

“Wha... who’s th... there?” 

“Isabel, you’re finally free to leave, darling.”

She crawls forward past her food bowl, wide eyed. “*Really?*”

I nod and pull out a key from my pocket, then draw near. She trembles.

“But under *one* condition, okay?”

“What is it, sir?” She sits on her knees.

“I want you to chew on this little tree branch, okay?” 

She joyfully receives her ‘ticket’ out and munches away. I admire her. My sweet little catch.

After a minute her hands freeze in the air, her neck tilts, and her skin rapidly turns blue. I proceed to unlock her, surprised at how fast the side effects kick in.

I kiss her forehead, her skin is hard and she doesn’t blink. I then ask, “What? You’d rather stay here with *me?*” I lock her back up. “Who knows, maybe I’ll plant you in a pot of soil? You’re not going anywhere.”

I rub her blue bark like skin and go back upstairs, turning the basement light off."

I gather the bullets I need for the job. I make sure to grease my weapon. I create a new believable identity every time I go out.

Some people might call me a vigilante of sorts. Once a week I go out and decide which child looks like they would make a good super hero.

Back when I was figuring out the best way to do this, I scanned every comic book characters origin story, and found there was always one common ground: having their inhibitions destroyed. One character's story in particular caught my eye, but we'll discuss that later.

So I go out and find the richest places I can, and destroy the thing that always holds the kids back from achieving their true potential.

Usually though, the kids end up just having extreme breakdowns, mental disorders, and often commit suicide because of my actions. 

The next kid will be the one, I can feel it. I will make the next Batman"

Plants can sometimes grow on you. 


I learnt something about the brain yesterday. 

When you complete a difficult task, your brain is rewarded with dopamine. Switch that difficult task with a basic human action, like anger, and swap out that dopamine with an extreme and unheard of highly addictive opioid. If you do that, you will become addicted to anger.

I learnt something about addiction yesterday.

 If you get a kick out of a drug, you will have to up your dosage in order to feel the same rush you did at first. Congratulations, you are now addicted to violence. 

I learnt something else about plants yesterday.

Plants can sometimes grow on you. Especially if you let them into an open wound. But who would let that happen on purpose, unless you are an absolute dumbass.

I learnt something about the Spouters yesterday. 

The news stations will report strange cases of plants sprouting inside of people’s stomachs. They call them Sprouters. There are no other symptoms other then all of the affected being noticeably angry. But you have a plant fucking growing your inside of you, so who wouldn’t be pissed off. 

I learnt something about my wiFe yesterday.

She won’t shut up. The bitch keeps on telling me to go to the hospital. Yelling at her felt felt so good.

I learnt something about my son yesterday.

The little brat got a bad grade, so I gave him some bruises. You can do better than a fucking 80%. Jesus Christ I felt powerful hitting him.

I learnt sOmething aboUt strangers yesterday.

The guy in front of me, yeah, guess what he did? GUESS! He fucking looked at me! So you want to know what I did!? I BIT HIS FUCKING EYES OUT!!! And it felt like heaven when I did it.

I LeANt SoMEThinG AbOut GarDeNInG TOdaY!!!!!!

If, if your stomach is feeling funny, FUCKING KILL SOMEONE!!! That will get the police and bystanders to come to you! And when they do, VOMIT DOWN THEIR THROATS!!! Your pain will be gone, and you will have started a brand new garden!!!  I FEELS SO FUCKING GOOD!!! You should really try it.

The plant is all over my body now. Growing out of my eyes, skin, and head. But I don’t care about the pain. Or anything. Nothing I do makes me feel good. Not even making new gardens. There is no rush anymore. Not anymore..."

I’ve been working in the mines for twenty years the same as my father before me and his father before him. I currently work in a deep mine, we go down 260 feet to one of the largest coal seams on earth. It sits right at the center of the Bancroft Mountain range.
 
I’ve heard stories my whole life of tommy knockers, ghosts and apparitions appearing in the mines. I’ve personally never encountered any of these or believed in them. But here recently things have been weird, I’m starting to change my mind about these paranormal things.
 
It all started about a month ago when the 2nd shift crew came out of the mine with reports of strange growling sounds. And Billy had found a necklace made out of what looked like teeth, he said he found it dangling from a cross support that the team had passed by just an hour before.
 
Then a couple days later two of the dump trucks had bloody little handprints all over them. The handprints were as small as a childs and each one only had three fingers. Tools and things from the worksite started disappearing only to be found a few days later deep inside the mine. A week after the hand prints were found, Billy came in and quit. He had been working with us for over ten years, Billy was a good guy. He said that the little bastards followed him home and were looking in his windows at night.
 
A week ago I had just finished my shift. I was just about to leave when I looked in my rearview mirror and I saw one of the little sons of bitches. It stood about three feet tall, its skin was a translucent pale grey color. It had a big head with large jet black eyes, and it had a huge mouth full of sharp little teeth. But no other facial features whatsoever. I stomped on the gas and got out of there as fast I could.
 
Now they’ve followed me home. My motion light has been kicking on about three or four times each night. When I look out the back window I can see the little fuckers walking around in the yard. A few days ago my dog, a big husky mix, got all worked up and took off into the woods. Two days later I found pieces of her scattered about the flower garden in the front yard. Today I woke up in complete darkness, I was lying prone on what felt like rock. I could hear the distant hum of machinery and it smelled like gravel or coal dust. I slowly realized that I was in the very bottom of the mine. As I looked up I found myself surrounded by large black eyes and hungry mouths full of sharp little teeth."

They had recently moved into the neighborhood but were out of our parent’s house. We decided to head to the store, relatively bored and having nothing better to do. On our way, we met this creepy looking older woman. We hadn’t noticed anything out of the odd about her until she came closer. As she passed, we noticed just how deformed and creepy her face truly looked. Her left eye was looking straight ahead, while her right eye was looking wildly in every direction. 

Seeing this shocked us to our core, chilling our bones and raising goosebumps on our arms. This wasn’t truly that peculiar, though something seemed very off. Making an impulse decision, we followed her around town until she eventually reached her home and departed inside. My elder siblings trying to prove their courage both volunteered to investigate the inside, and I watched as they entered the run-down old shack of a house.

Jack and Mary still had yet to return after some passage of time. Taking it upon myself, I entered the creepy home as well. Upon walking through the door, my eyes met nothing but thin air and cobwebs. After exploring the abandoned abode, I saw a dim light come from the basement. Against my better judgment, I slowly crept down the stairs. What I saw on the cracked concrete floor will traumatize my very mind for the rest of my life.

I saw the same old woman as before, but this time it was different. This time, horror blazed up my spine, freezing me in my very spot. The old woman I had seen before was now morphed into an amalgamation of limbs, pinchers, and eyes. This creature was like no other, half-human, and half arachnid. I turned to flee the confining underbelly of the home, only to be grabbed around the waist. 

Long, sharp pinchers stabbed into my abdomen, pain searing into my skin. I screamed in agony, yet the beast did not release me. She stuck me down her horrid throat, swallowing me whole. Time passed of me sitting alone and scared in the stomach of the beast before I saw another sign of life. It was my beloved siblings, Jack and Mary! Jack began kicking at the inside of the beast while Mary hugged me tight to her wiry form. Soon after a long struggle, we heard a sickening rip and fell to the floor. The beast screeched behind us but faded away soon after, never to be heard from again. 

Everyone came out fine that day, and I even got to drink some hot cocoa while my siblings talked to the sheriff. What I saw that day will always haunt me, but I won’t let it affect me. I won’t give that beast what it wanted in the first place."

 I see their faces on the news on social media and even on posters. People wish them well every time they see them and if they don’t see them for a while they get worried and some even presume them dead. The trend is usually the same, they don’t see their friends often no more nor do they see their parents because the fame has separated them from the true people that care for them. 



The part that amazes me the most is when the fans get to see them in person, almost always the true fans are always reduced to tears. These are the fans that have been waiting for ages for a chance to meet them face to face and tell them how much they appreciate them.



 I can tell you it takes 10 years to make a celebrity. The first year they act erratic and still cling on to the hope they will get out. The second year is all about depression as their hopes slowly dwindle.by the third year they are completely broken, they can even ask for help because they know none is coming. That is when they get a camera and streaming equipment, they are so overjoyed they even manage to forget where they are. Ladies and Gentleman that is how you make a celebrity.



 I can see her she thinks she is safe in a group at night but she is mistaken. I give her three drinks at least until I can charm her and gain her trust. They will never identify me with this prosthetic mask I have on. With that pretty face and amazing figure, she will be a mega star but she has to pay the price first."

She felt her stomach desperately trying to consume something for energy to the point it began consuming her own body fat.

On Tuesday her house caught fire, she tried running for the door but it disappeared in front of her eyes.

The fire licked away at her flesh as she was unable to run while the fire and smoke made breathing even harder.

As her own flesh began to cook she felt every second of her torture.

On Wednesday she was bitten to death by insects, they came swarming in from the window and kept eating her till the bone.

She felt all the tiny claws bit into her flesh as she tried to scream, making her lungs only fill with more crawling insects.

On Thursday she froze to death, she was locked out of her house the moment a blizzard hit her area. She was unable to move after only 1 minute, she felt all of her organs fail while she fell to the cold ground underneath her.

And today, as she woke up, she prepared for another horrible death.

No matter how many times she died, she kept waking up in that bed, unable to scream or cry.

She remembered every time she died vividly, the bites, the starvation and the cold.

As she went on with her day she couldn’t help but stare up at the sky.

In the sky there was something written in mirror image.

The meaning behind the words in the sky was lost to her but she hated them.

Somehow she knew her suffering was connected to the words written in the sky.

It was such an innocent way of saying it, another cloning failed, another fetus to be terminated. Were they conscious at this stage, or even human anymore? Yes, it’s true that the act of cloning and genetic manipulation of humans was not legal or ethical, but they were curing diseases. They were saving lives! He would tell himself this over and over to ease the burden of guilt. He knew what “Unviable” meant, termination and incineration of the fetus; leave no evidence.

How long had he been working straight this time? He couldn’t recall, long enough that he was having trouble seeing again. He looked in the mirror trying to get his eye straightened, to bring it back parallel with the other. For as long as he could remember this would happen. As the day dragged on, his lazy eye would slide out of position until it was difficult to see, giving him a throbbing headache. He often wondered if this problem was the reason that he pushed so hard to improve humanity… 

No matter, a few hours of sleep and he would be fine. He never let it hold him back, this entire CRISPR genetic research company was his! Well… There was Jeff, his silent partner with silent being the operative word! While he labored day and night, Jeff was mostly away from the lab “networking.”. “It’s OK though; when the breakthrough comes, I’ll make sure I get the credit.” He thought. The breakthrough had to be close, the viability rate was improving with defect rates declining.

The defects could range from “visible insignificant” to “hidden extreme.” It was their biggest challenge, the biggest risk of being shut down. That’s why the Unviability Protocol was established and implemented. Earlier now, while they were fetuses, they were much easier to incinerate with less waste. He was close to a breakthrough he knew it.  He must make sure Jeff didn’t the credit for it. Jeff was always out doing something else, anything but work it seemed. He heard rumors that Jeff had everything, money, beautiful wife, extravagant vacations… All these things he was working to provide for Jeff. Yes, he would confront Jeff the next time he came in the office. For now, a nap to restore his vision, then back to work on the nearly perfect Subject 414. 

He saw Jeff’s silhouette slipping down the hall towards the office. Today was the day he would confront Jeff, either Jeff will start carrying his weight, or he would dissolve the partnership! He kicked the office door open and froze… There was Jeff staring back shocked… Had he never realized the similarities? They wore protective masks in the lab… Jeff looked like his twin brother, his almost perfect twin brother… His twin brother without the lazy eye…

Jeff slammed the intercom: “Security!! It’s Subject Nineteen… He’s become unviable!”"

""Although I hoped you'd have more restraint to yourself, I can understand that you joined the police corps just so that you can chase your parents killer.""

I contemplated in silence as the vivid images of the horror 12 years ago suddenly came back to life in my head.

""So there you have it. You have killed him,"" he spoke again while checking his watch. ""I have called the coroner team. We may have 10 minutes before they arrived. Let's check the scene.""

I moved forward and slowly approached the body in the dark with my gun still pointed out, while Shawn wore his gloves and checked out the nearest cabinet. The killer wore a navy jacket with black sporty pants, making him hard to see within this dark abandoned building in the middle of the night like this. But his mask is unmistakable. The police got a tip yesterday that a homicide happened in this block and random passenger saw someone wearing a mask with the exact description as the one who killed my parents. I opt to take the case and Shawn went with me as well.

""But it's a curious thing,"" he flipped over the files on the cabinet, ""from these documents, he looked like a normal scientist to me, not a homicidal maniac."" He put down those files back and closed the cabinet. ""And from your story, he looked like always able to get out from arrest no matter how the police cornered him?""

""Yes, that's what I read from the police reports,"" I threw Shawn a serious look, ""so that's why we can't lower our guard. Have you go through his desk?"" I shone my flashlight on the messy desk on the other side of the room.

""Yeah, on it,"" Shawn walked. I returned my sight on the body. ""Wait... the body is \*gone\*!"" I shouted.

""Wait, what?"" Shawn came to me. I shone my flashlight further and see a trail from the pool of blood stretched outside the other door of the room. I immediately ran toward the trail. ""Hey, wait!"" Shawn shouted behind me.

I followed the trail in the dark through a dark hallway. The trail turned behind a closed door.

I pointed my gun and slowly opened the door. It's dark. The room was quite messy, the air felt stagnant. The trail of blood suddenly stopped in the middle of the room.

Shawn showed up on the door with his flashlight. ""Did you found him?""

""No, not yet. He even took his mask,"" I replied.

""Oh, you mean this?"" Shawn reached up to his jacket and pulled out the mask, that dreaded mask.

""How did you..."" my sentence trailed off as Shawn's face changed and transformed... into my face.

Suicide would work, but I can't work up the courage to do it. Knife, pills, toaster, it's scary, and all bring an intense moment, albeit brief, of suffering. And what if I survive? Vegetative or disabled, stuck in a rehab center, no, I can't commit suicide.

I've tried distracting myself with worldly pleasures, sex, money, entertainment, but there are always those moments when I am jolted back to a world of suffering. When I stub my toe or feel ashamed of something when I imagine my death or a hell of endless suffering.

So when *it* asked what I truly wanted, I responded honestly.

I want to be rid of the pain.

And it took it from me.

It's been a week.

I can't feel anything. There's a dull pressure when I contact something, but no pain. 

It was fine at first, I bumped into a few things, gave myself a few bruises I didn't even notice until later,

But now.....I'm desperate for any sensation, something vibrant and sharp rather than just this dull world that I can't experience.

My teeth don't hurt my tongue, I chewed right threw it, not even realizing I'd been wounded until hot, fresh blood flowed into my throat

My eyes don't hurt, I've blinded myself from the sun and squirted vinegar straight into my pupils. It damages my eyes, but they still can't feel.

My knife doesn't hurt my stomach, my hands, my scalp.

By now there are remnants of my attempts in every room of the house.

Teeth, hair, burnt flesh, skin, nails, blood, fingers...

I've damaged myself so much, I'm on the brink of death. At least this makes suicide a bit easier.

I want to feel again. I want the stimulation that comes with being alive, the suffering that comes with existence.

Because this...

This feeling is so much worse."

A creek even babbled in the background. I loved the peace of these woods but to my trained eye the evidence of my prey was clear. I followed the trail silently, the prey had to be close, the prints were very fresh. I kept walking and enjoying the beauty of the hunt. The prints kept on getting newer and newer she couldn't be far now. I raised my bow. It was more elegant, a bow. The strength required for the bow. The simple beauty in a sharp stick taking life, propelled by your force. archery was more alive than a gun. Anyway a gun would scare the wildlife, and people. I am grateful to live in New York. Prey was incredibly easy to find. For deer, permits were handed out like halloween candy. for other animals, no one cares except the rangers who had to find my work. The overcast day made for a perfect ambiance for the mood of my hunt. Maybe my prey felt the same.


I'm close now. So close. A whole hour had passed as I was tracking her. This one is smart for her kind. She made false prints for me to follow. Then she and hid in brambles. She nearly escaped me, but her very breath betrayed her. I turned and let loose my arrow. I looked at her, such a beautiful specimen, even with my black arrow sticking out of her breast. Her hide would serve me well. Maybe I could make her a rug. But that was too obvious. A coat would just get me dirty looks. A curtain would work perfectly. I got to work skinning.


I left her in an obvious spot. The carrion birds would find her easy and nothing would go to waste. Unless a ranger came by. Maybe I ought to hunt them. I still felt bad though. I would've collected meat but my freezer was already full. This hunt felt lackluster, I had been feeling burnt out about my passion. Maybe I would take a break. Maybe I would move on to bigger prey. I snapped out of my reverie as I saw my car.



I sat down in the living and set to enjoying my dinner. Some stew made with meat from a prior hunt. The rich porky taste was an experience. I turned on the T.V and flipped the news on. What I saw gave me a good chuckle. The newscaster reported with misplaced disgust; ""The New York Skinner has struck again, claiming his twenty sixth victim."" It panned to an interview with a police officer. Right where I had left my victim. With my recognition and amusement I turned off the T.V and enjoyed my stew."

She looked again, smiled.

Her name was Donna. She was leafing through “Intercourse” by Andrea Dworkin. She was surprised when I told her I knew Dworkin. She studied gender theory and had never met a guy who knew about feminism.

She put the book down, smiled at me as if to ask, what now?

I fell in love with her right then.

We walked all over the campus together. It was sunny and warm. Donna had long, wavy hair and smooth, creamy skin; I was so happy. We walked and walked, held hands. After dark, I kissed her outside the university library. The air smelled of pinecones and amber. She said she didn’t normally kiss guys she just met, but she felt so comfortable with me. I said it was the same for me and ran my hand through her thick hair and over the soft skin of her arms.

For our second date I cooked boeuf bourguignon. Donna wore a red dress with matching high heels. She joked, laughed softly, like melodious birdsong. We drank wine.

Donna told me how impressed she was. I was different from the guys she normally dated, those meat-headed jocks with their puffed-up, fragile sense of masculinity. Unlike them, I understood objectification and the male gaze and intersectionality. Her eyes were saying: you understand me. You see the soul inside of me.

We moved to the couch. Her kisses were hungry and when I slipped my hand underneath her dress she trembled. Her breath was fast and her face flushed. Then, suddenly, she withdrew her tongue from my mouth and her body slackened.

I looked at her face. She was asleep, like an angel. The tranquilliser had made sure of that.

Gently I stroked her face. I was relieved she hadn’t suspected anything; I’m not a mean person. I don’t like seeing girls in pain.

Most of all, I wouldn’t want to damage her. The soft wavy hair. The creamy, unblemished skin. It deserved only the best. I had improved my technique a lot: I could now remove the skin with just a few incisions to the torso, legs and arms so it would stay largely intact. It was young and strong yet tender, just like Donna. I was very excited – what an amazing suit I would tailor out of it, what I would look like wearing it! And the hair would be the best wig ever, the crown jewel in my collection! I would be so pretty.

Before that, though, I had to take care of Donna. She too deserved to be treated well. She was a person, not a thing. She was more than just skin and hair. I wanted to cherish her, preserve her forever. I picked up the heavy down pillow from last time, put it over her head, pressed."

e9cn8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e9cn8j/hometown_haunts/,Hometown Haunts,22,4,1576096142.0,"Everyone knew about Old Man Murray's. It was one of those hometown legends that most small towns in the US had, legends that develop out of people's fascination with the paranormal. That and boredom. It was a local tradition to go out to Murray's and try and catch a glimpse of the ghost that supposedly lurked there. Guys would bring girls out there hoping to literally scare the pants off of them.

There was a trick to rousing the ghost for your viewing pleasure. You knocked on the door three times. You yelled out his name three times. And if you saw him you ran like hell.

Billy Ferguson was dating one of the best looking girls at school, Chelsea Whitesell. He had been trying to get into her pants for months to no avail, but he was already making plans for this weekend. He felt that this was the one that he'd finally go the distance with Chelsea. He had put a new condom in his wallet, worrying that the one he'd kept in there had gone bad after the eons of misuse. He planned to take her to Old Man Murray's, get her good and scared.

It seemed like a good plan.

\######

Their headlights skimmed over the old highway as they looked for the turn off. The sun was completely gone and what little light left was just an afterthought. Billy was anxious and a little scared, but that was okay because Chelsea was also and she clung to him.

\######

Leland reached for the stereo and fiddled with it. He was a little too loose, a little too drunk, and when he felt the road get rougher he looked up to see himself heading towards the ditch. He slammed the brakes with little effect and he was thrown all over the cab. When he recovered, his head was aching and his windshield cracked. He stumbled out of the truck to assess the damage.

Headlights appeared over a small incline. He saw the vehicle turn off on a side road. He realized he was near Old Man Murray's. He went back to get something out of his truck and set off on foot.

\#####

“Old Man Murray! Old Man Murray! Old Man Murray!” Billy yelled, while Chelsea hunkered down in fear.

Nothing happened.

“See Chelsea? It’s all fake.”

\######

Leland could see a girl and a boy. The girl was *fine* too. Bad thoughts filled his brain and something cold rose within him. It was something that had always been there. It had been so long since he got some that he hadn’t had to pay for. His head ached and rang, partly from the alcohol, partly from the wreck, partly from something else.

\######

Billy saw a man walking towards them carrying a shotgun.

“M-m-murray?” he stammered.

The man laughed for a long time.

“Nah kid. Some things are worse than ghosts.” the man said. The shotgun was steady in his hand."

""Do it""

County by county, state by state, they ravaged it all. Internet, gone. Phone lines, gone. Communication, gone. We decided to stay at home and secure it as much as possible, since we didn't know where else to go.

I lied when I told her the door could hold.

""Do it, Jacob"" she whispered

""I can't. I can't "" I answered, crying as quietly as possible

""You said you would. You promised""

Now I hear them walking in our living room, going through our stuff. There must bee at least 30, and it sounds like some are making their way upstairs.

""Please"" she whispered again ""One for me, one for you. Then it'll all be over""

They were outside the door now. They were trying to open it. 

I looked at the gun in my hand. 

All those lies I told her.

Most drug related, a few bad accidents, but my most difficult challenge isn't either of those things. I guess my tale will go down as the ghost stories we drivers pass around to each other. So don't believe me if you want but either way, don't go looking for trouble. 

It's was about 3:45am when my eyes started to feel heavy. My brain said sleep but my paycheck said work, if you know what I mean. Regardless of money, my yawns got the better of me and I decided to stop somewhere nearby. It seemed like fate because, almost the second I made up my mind, a Diner came into view. Perfect, I thought while pulling into the huge parking lot. 

Right above the glass door entryway stood a faded neon sign. It read:

Morningstar Cafe!
Open 24/7

The name sounded as good to me as any, I was very tired and hungry. Thoughts of a pecan pie lured me into the small quaint building. The inside was chromed out like a retro diner would be and behind the counter sat a man polishing glass cups one by one. 

No greeting just:
""Take a menu"" he handed me a small list of microwavable food without looking up from his task.
I didn't mind the old guy though, never was one for small talk. But he sure did have a creepy quality to him. The menu had a picture of a crudely drawn woman with a cowboy hat, a red flannel top, and short shorts. At first, her hat caught my eye,

It read 
""let us be the morning  after the stars"".

But then I noticed a much more odd slogan printed in large letters on the bottom of the menu.
""Employee's must wash hands""

What a odd place for that sign. Usually those are in bathrooms so why would this place remind everyone of bowel movements while looking at their food. It seems like a horrible marketing strategy on their half.

Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask the rude man still shining any cup he could find. 
""Why is the bathroom door sign on the menu? Seems like a bad idea""

He snapped out of his trance and froze while facing away. A chill ran through my spine and I was about to say ""nevermind"" when he finally spoke again. 

""Wait right here""

Those words were straight out of a horror movie but I couldn't seem to move until he came back with a large plastic tub. Before I could ask about it he tossed it on the table and the content scattered everywhere. 

My mind didn't want to believe it at first but the smell proved it to be true. Severed hands littered the table like a cannibal butcher shop. My heart dropped into my stomach and I realized I couldn't scream. I wanted to more than anything but my body wouldn't let me. Then he spoke again. 

""They're super clean. Our employees wash fresh ones daily""

The sentence released me from the bizarre trance and I ran. I ran to my rig and got the fuck out of dodge. He didn't try to stop me.  

Thats pretty much all i remember before the accident. Cops peeled me out of the vehicle with the jaws of life. They told me I wouldn't stop screaming about a murderer at a truck stop nearby but there wasn't one around for miles. Strangely, I'm not surprised by this. Diner food is hell."

My partner, Hoss, roughly 20 years my senior, threw his shoulder in the door. Hoss is 280 pounds of pork chops and sheppard’s pie, that door should’ve gave in. But it didn’t. 

The lights and noise stopped, and the door finally caved. Hoss fell into the room with the Mom and Dad trampling over top of him. The little girl was lifeless, surrounded by scorch marks. 

I stepped away from the scene and got on the horn. I told dispatch to send a medic ASAP. When I turned around, Hoss had the kid in his arms. The kid had just started the transition, looked like she could be saved, but honestly, who knows. Hoss took her over to the table and started giving her the once-over. Dispatch came back asking for specifics.

“Hoss,” I said, “give me something. HQ wants specifics.”

He was looking through her hair, between her toes, and inside her mouth. Any markings, bruises, or tattoos we could get some insight from. 

“Hoss,” I groaned, “come on!”

“She’s.” He stuttered, “She looks fine.”

Hoss opens her eyes. He pauses and looks back at me. I could see it in his eyes. I think we all could. The Mom and Dad stopped fighting against me and started to beg for leniency.  

“It’s her eyes”, I sighed, “isn’t it.”

Hoss nodded and stepped back. I got on the horn with dispatch again.

“Dispatch. They got her. They’re beleivers.”

Hoss walked away and punched the wall. I looked at the parents and drew my weapon.

“The kids got no soul. These sons of bitches are smuggling souls.”"

Now here I am.

*THUMP!*

What was that, was it my neighbours? Maybe, I only have a kitchen next door. This is not good, I thought. I looked and there it was ‘the list’ well that it was I thought more like screens. Opposite ‘the list’ was everything I thought of; the good, the bad and death - yes death. But I did not see anything about death that I had thought of. The smell of the erotic fibres, every scenraio played at once of what I could image doing to myself in harmful ways. But this wasn’t it, no ghosts, no spirit not even my dad. But I could feel something that was there in my stomach and I didn’t know how to feel.

*THUMP!*

The thump was actually burglars dressed in black in white strips from the cartoons smashing fridge-freezer that never worked due to it’s small wires that could never reach my plug. 

They had seen me when I entered, in a panic one of them grabbed the rigged cut knife from his pocket and you guessed it. I was stabbed in the stomach death had found me, the burglars in panic ran off, stealing anything that was available.

  Needless to say, I got extremely good at seeing the little things in life.  I got really good at reading the little gestures that people made.  You'd be surprised at how often your body portrays what you are really feeling regardless of how well you can hide it.   

  
  At first, this power was enjoyable.  I could see the details in every flower, making them more beautiful to me, or could see when someone was secretly upset and befriend them to make them happier.   

  
  However, this took a turn around a week ago.  Ever since I noticed my special abilities, I could see things that aren't quite right.  It started with a tree that seemed too...straight if that makes sense.  Then, it was a stop sign that was too red.   

   
Today, while on a walk through the park, I stopped and focused on a “No Littering” sign. Something was off, something surreal about it.  That's when I realized that the sign was staring back at me.  I gasped in shock, and jumped back.  Apparently with its' disguise uncovered, a tall, skinny, twisted figure peeled itself off the sign with a sickening pop.

Its winces, coupled with the puppeteer's well-rhythmed wales, made the group of children shriek and coil, the three young brothers seeking comfort in fraternal arms. They then ran away, furthering their distance with the haunted house's employee. Such a fright he had caused, as others by the past weeks, only made him prouder of his talent.

However, with each wale voiced his throat felt hoarser and drier, due to his own usual tone hardly qualifying as pitchy. He decided taking a pause wouldn't hurt for now, and avidly wanted some water. Hence, he engulfed himself away from the dim light a hidden bulb provided through the eyes of a monster on the wall.

As he walked his way, slowly as to not hurt a wanderer customer, a thought, an idea the crawling creeps this place's atmosphere brought him, hatched. As it had just been two weeks since he accepted this nightly gig, he had never even seen the place lighted. He would definitely find this a cool sight. Filled with such a sentiment, he then planned on asking his employer.

But, as he continued adventuring himself in the dark, using his good old, loyal puppet to fumble about, he felt as if a movement grazed him... He froze and thought, his neck as if chilling. But, perhaps, an idea came as an angel trying to comfort him in his loneliness, perhaps it had just been a fly? Or some other bug, since summer surely hit warmer outside, and the dark would not fend them off in the slightest.

Shrugging it off, he went on. Yet, thinking back about the way he had taken, it seemed to him he had gone the wrong way. However, where to go, then? Turning back, he knew his orientation had failed him. Damn! His phone was in his bag,  in the workers' room... That meant, he could not use the flash-light to find his way.

At first, his hand felt antsy. The sensation then only grew. To work here, he was definitely not afraid of the black. But why would his hand tremble so? No, something had to be off and eerie. Whatever that was, it touched his flesh, inside the puppet's glove! It itched as if some repeated insect bites, his skin hurting, the pain warning him. Even blind, he instinctively knew where his hand was, and tried getting the glove off!

After much pain, his skin as if screaming, the glove fell to the floor. The noise of wood hammering the floor brought him relief. However, as he began running, seeking proximity near the dim bulb's shimmer, he looked back, more and more afraid as he could only make out the puppet's face, flying and nearing."

It’s a three kilometers route through the city park, familiar for anyone who’s lived here long enough and so always occupied by runners – not so much at this time though. It’s quiet then, where the only sounds are my own breaths, my shoes hitting the ground and crickets chirping all around. I’m all alone for the most part, except for the one or two I come across. Everything about the run puts my mind at ease.

That does not mean you can let down your guard, though. Take note of your surroundings at all times, as the route at night can be very disorienting.

It is common for the bushes to rustle. It is a park with wildlife, after all. Your first clue should be how the rustling speeds up all of a sudden, even when it is a windless night. It quickly fades as you run further away, and voices will begin to seep through ahead and around the corner. It is a voice of a woman deep in conversation, cheery and flirty which does not belong to the time of the night – when you round the bend, you’ll find nobody there.

It is imperative that you turn around now and *sprint* \- out of the park and back home.

If you do continue on, you’ll find no trouble for the rest of the route, until you realise that you’ve not seen another runner for the whole of the route. This is when you hope that a patch of maple trees comes after the willows. Pray to god you run past the red veranda (*built in memory of Mary J. Hoover)* only once. If you find yourself running along rows upon rows of endless willow trees, you’ll most certainly see the veranda, take a left, see the veranda, take another left and see that blood red veranda again.

You’re in trouble. What comes next is a woman’s voice within the trees, calling out your name. *Hey, David. Are you lost? You always will be.* You’ll stay on the path, where three kilometres stretch into six and minutes become hours but night does not turn into day.

How do you escape that? You can’t. You should have turned around when you had the chance to. You've gone too far.

When you finally get tired and stop, I’ll be right behind you."

So when one of my other neighbors, Frank, started going through a rough divorce, we were all worried about him. Poor guy had always been a little odd - you know, on the sensitive side - and when his wife left him, well, he was inconsolable. The night Jane walked out, all of us knew to keep watch, just in case.

Every night since the split, I'd gone over and played cards with him, just to keep his mind off things. He was smiling, but only ever with his mouth. He just had this blank, vacant stare the whole time, you know the kind older men tend to have?

It was a pleasant surprise when I came over one evening to play, and he didn't respond to my knock on the door. I could hear voices inside - the TV, turned up real loud.

When I checked through the living room window - just to be safe, you know? - I see him and Jane, sitting together on the couch, just watching TV. Frank was smiling, eyes fixed to the TV. Blank, vacant stare. He and Jane were embracing.

Next morning, our nice little neighborhood was crawling with police, as they pushed two covered stretchers into the back of a van. This wouldn't've been such a shock to me if I'd looked up the night before, and seen the two frayed wires where Frank had ripped the carbon monoxide detector out of the ceiling."

Her name was Sarah, not that anyone called her that, because Sarah knew it all. Sarah was good at maths and english, and art and history. Sarah knew that the sun was a star and not a planet. Sarah knew how babies were made. Most of all, Sarah knew what happened when people died.

Because Sarah, at one point, had died too. 

Sarah talked about a before and after. A before Sarah. But she did not talk about this much. 

But Sarah did talk about other things. Sarah talked about hiking in beautiful places, about swimming with colorful fish. Sarah also talked about less interesting topics, like politics. Little Sarah talked like an adult sometimes. But for someone so smart, some teacher’s did not like her.

Especially Miss Nelly. Sometimes, Miss Nelly would stare at Sarah, and Sarah would stare back. The other children would be much too focused on their books, or too focused on chatting to each other to notice. But there were often moments like those, moments of tension and an unsettling connection between the two. But what everyone did notice that Miss Nelly did not like Sarah. 

Miss Nelly was often cold and rude to little Miss Know-it-all. Tight-lipped, tense, and never offering a smile. Miss Nelly routinely refused to look at little Sarah in the eye. But on the rare times she did, Ms Nelly seemed to look away immediately, with an anguished and fearful look in her aged face.

Because little Miss Know-it-all, knew it all, and Sarah knew Nelly Osborne’s secret. 

Miss Nelly knew about before Sarah. Miss Nelly knew about the broken body her troubled son put in the water. Ms Nelly had helped him bury the body that soon floated atop the calm waters of the lake near the Osborne’s home. She helped bury a woman, but now returned was a child. A child who on her first day of class with Ms Nelly said to her...

“I know what you are hiding at 34 Becker St and under the shed”."

Ricky was obsessed with his health, he could lift up to 250 pounds and spent the past year watching his body get to perfect form. Although his biceps and chest were bulging, Ricky’s confidence was not. Ricky simply was not seeing the progress he needed for himself. He finished his routine and dumped the last bit of protein mix into his blender, downing his concoction while staring at himself in the mirror. Ricky flexed his arm, “Look at my spindly arms, the guys at the gym are gonna laugh.” 

     Ricky turned away in a huff, he paced around wondering what was missing, what could he do to get his strength up? Then Ricky noticed his cat watching him from the corner. Ricky got an idea, a disturbing, morbid idea. An hour later, Ricky downed another concoction, this time he made his way to bed, his cat now missing from the corner.


     All of the guys at the gym marveled at Ricky’s built body, he stood like stone, and worked like a machine. For Ricky, it still wasn’t enough. Ricky got another vile, unforgivable idea. That night he invited his gym buddy over for dinner. An hour into his visit, Ricky stood over his concoction, for a moment he became ashamed at what he had become.

He usually despised it; Halloween was always his favorite holiday. Every year they would get together fitting as many spooky thrills as possible into the week of the holiday. “Week o Ween” they called it, he looked forward to it all year! This year they had all stayed overnight at the haunted asylum. It was the first time he felt that he was in the presence of truly evil spirits. That’s probably why the guides had such strict rules.

He couldn’t remove anything… Shouldn’t is what they should’ve said. They were in the basement; dungeon, described more accurately. The rest of the group was distracted, enthralled by the EMF spikes and audio disruptions. It was the first time he heard a voice in the static. He couldn’t make out the individual words, but he felt a pulling, almost an instinctive urge to slip away and investigate a loose bit of mortar. Picking at it he discovered a small crevice, inside a small golden ring. He’s not sure, but the voice may have encouraged him, gifted it to him. He shouldn’t have taken it; he knew that with certainty now. 

The moment he touched the ring he felt a chill, the clammy cold sweat you get before you vomit was mild compared to this chill. He tried to put it back, but it was now part of him. In the past two months his symptoms have gotten much worse. It felt like his body was dying from the inside out. Just this morning he lost another tooth when he vomited. He’s not completely sure, but he thought there were maggots crawling in the bowl before he flushed. 

He read every article he could find on the subject and realized what he needed to do. The ring was cursed, gifting it to another and them accepting it, was the only way to escape the curse. He couldn’t bring himself to gift it to a friend or family member, especially since they’ve seen how sick he’s become. He tried to gift it to strangers with no luck. People are so questioning these days…. 

But now Christmas was coming!! That meant online Secret Santa time! With the plan formed, he created several burner accounts, providing positive feedback and quality content to gain as many points as possible in a short time. He had no idea who this person was or if they would ever figure it out, he just knew that he would now live. Rings can be an awkward gift, so he hid it inside another gift. Mail the package, wait for the acceptance message, then burn the accounts… 

But first, one last post on the site, a short scary story dedicated to the person who now has the ring… a gift of knowledge of how to escape the curse… more likely a selfish act to alleviate the guilt by giving them a chance.

Christmas is here! This year, it’s the greatest time of year!!

I stared out the front of my open lean-to at the white wasteland, watching the snow settle even deeper. It was so very cold and I was so very, very hungry. The forearm I had cooked over night was the last of my meat. I sifted through the ashes of my fire and found a couple of burnt fingers to chew on. They weren’t very satisfying. The closest village was a couple miles to the north of my position, it was time to go hunting for my next meal.
 
The small village of Teh’Kuhta was on a remote island in the Hudson Bay, north of Quebec. The villagers had come to both fear and respect the shadow people that lived in the stunted shrublands  of their island. Often they would leave out offerings and occasionally even make a sacrifice in hopes of being left alone. They were frightened of the shadow people, even more so than the great white northern bears that could fell a grown man with one swipe of the paw.
 
The villagers fear me and rightly so. I can move through these wastelands without making a sound, my unbridled strength, rage and hunger have made me into nothing less than death incarnate. Even now I circled their village, not a single dog barked, not a single warrior stirred. They would only know of my presence if I chose to let them know. I spotted my prey not very far away, my stomach grumbled at the thought of food.
 
The dogs were trained not to bark. The villagers were aware of the presence, warriors ever so slightly nodding their heads and using silent hand signals to mark its dark passing. The shadow person was circling their village and they knew it. Their latest offering was being ignored, it wanted something else.
 
I carefully measured each step, each breath, each movement. My quarry was very close now and he had no idea that I was stealthily approaching his back. The villager’s offering wasn’t enough, not this time.
 
The Teh'Kuhta'n warrior silently drew back an arrow, waiting for the shadow person to get just a little closer.
 
I watched the warrior draw back his arrow. I was on all fours now, approaching with the stealth only a true predator can possess. The warrior didn't even see me. I leaped ten feet through the air, came down with a snarl and broke my quarry's neck with my teeth. The taste of hot blood was nice. Swiftly, oh so swiftly I carried my prize back off into the frozen wastelands.
 
The warrior watched it all with a calm complacency, he nodded to his fellow warriors. The village would be safe for another night.
 
I began roasting the spitted shadow person over my roaring fire, my stomach growled in anticipation. I smiled a very large and toothy smile to myself, I wouldn't go hungry tonight."

However, as I grew up, these thoughts just started to vanish, and I just kind of ignored them when they ocassionally showed up, I mean, I didn’t even have the time to think about those things, you know; work, friends, hobbies, etc. 

But now, I’m gonna have enough time to think about those things, but instead of fearing the thought of “ceasing to exist”, I just want it to happen, I just want to stop feeling, but my consciousness isn’t turning off, I’m lost in the void of nothing, alone, with nothing to see, in a permanent state of panic, wanting to DIE...Am I gonna be trapped here for all eternity? I’m scared, I don’t want to exist anymore."
e8haga,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e8haga/road_signs/,Road Signs,11,3,1575931042.0,"In South Newman, Kent, there is a strange phenomenon that occurs whenever an individual finds themselves driving home alone at night. On the side of the road, you will see a person, not always the same person, standing there, staring at you as you go past. Even stranger still is that this individual is always pointing. Pointing to where, or at what, has never been discovered, and the direction always seems to be at random. 

Some say they the people they see are dead loved ones, while others report seeing famous historical figures; one particularly charismatic individual adamantly believes it was the ghost of the town’s first mayor, who went missing almost 200 years ago, and that he was pointing to where his body now lies, still undiscovered to this day. 

I, myself,  have a different theory. See, I believe that these figures are spirits; ghosts that are not yet at rest. They are those that still have unfinished business, and they only appear to those they recognise, pointing in the direction of the person that cut their lives short. I understand that this explanation seems an unbelievable one; outlandish at best. But it’s the only one that makes sense. 

I hope I’m wrong. God, I hope I’m wrong. But I know I’m not. I know because earlier tonight, I was driving home from work, and standing there, on the side of the road, I saw my sister. She was pointing straight at me."
e8gci3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e8gci3/18th_birthday/,18th Birthday,20,0,1575926859.0,"I heard it first the night of my 18th birthday, and have heard it every night since. A whirring, electronic sound, high pitched, burning my ears. Nothing I do can stop me hearing it, nothing changes it’s pitch, or volume. Like a ringing in the ears after a loud concert, it stays.

Then, to my torment, on the night of my 19th birthday, I saw it. Or rather, I didn’t see. I was blinded by a bright light. From the minute my head touched the pillow, to the break of dawn, my room would be filled with light. I tried covering my face but it did not work. The light stayed the same.

Needless to say, I rarely slept. I was permanently exhausted, moody. Friends started to drift away, some even mumbling about drugs if I tried to explain myself. I moved out of my parent’s house, hoping that the noise and light wouldn’t follow me. But they did.

It was on the night of my 20th birthday that things came to a breaking point. The noise started, the light started and then I felt them. Cold, rough hands probing my body, every inch of my paralyzed, vulnerable self. I tried to sit up and fight them off but I couldn’t. I felt pinpricks as I was injected, or they took blood, or both I’m not sure. I felt the scrape as they scratched off skin cells, and heard the snips as hair was cut off for examination.

On the morning after my 20th birthday, when dawn had broken, I could finally move. I sat up and examined myself. Everything was pretty much the same as always, except for a patch of dry skin on my upper left arm, that seemed cold to the touch.

On the night of my 21st birthday, the noise didn’t come. The light didn’t come. The hands didn’t come. After three years of suffering, they finally came. I looked like them now, my skin dry and rough and cold to the touch. My hair had fallen out, and for that I was glad, the contact caused my scalp to itch. I ceased to wear clothes when I ceased to look female, to look human. Just an asexual figure.

A different light illuminated my room that night. It was soft, inviting. I joined them. It takes three years to gain recruits, and we already have thousands here. We rid them of humanity of the mind, then rid them of humanity of the body. I’m not sure why we do this, but there's tension in the atmosphere. We have received coded messages from others, like ourselves. They seem to spark excitement within the leaders.

The message it simple, and I offer it to you as a warning. 

“One more.”"

“Listening to what?” Ryan asked. Everyone exchanged glances and noticed one of the receptionists in a similar state. Shannon was sitting perfectly still, eyes glued to the conference room, attentively listening.

“Shannon?” I reached out to touch her shoulder. 

She ignored me and brushed my hand away. As the boss man made his way out of the conference room, Jordan and Shannon both stood up. 

“I always knew you were fucking racist.” Jordan shouted seemingly out of nowhere. He pointed his finger directly at the CEO’s face, inches away from tapping his nose with his pointer finger. 

“I’m sorry Jordan, what?” Todd looked equal parts confused and guilty. 

“I always knew you were FUCKING racist.” Jordan raised his voice but stood still. Todd looked around at all of us- his glare stopped at Shannon, who was fixed on him the entire time. Without responding, Todd bolted across the office knocking over the coffee cart and almost flipping the copier machine over. He was gone.

“Jordan what is going on?” I stopped and sat down in his chair. After a few more seconds of not saying anything, he looked down, breaking eye contact with me.

“Jess, a few minutes ago I heard something really loud and high pitched, like a ringing in my head.”

“Okay…? It must have just been some kind of frequency, not everyone can hear them.”

“Shannon heard it too.”

“Okay what’s your point? You two are special?” I said sarcastically.

Jordan rolled his eyes and shot me a very familiar glare. After years of dating, living together, and almost getting married, I knew his mannerisms pretty well; especially the signs of irritation. 

“Jesus Jess, you’re still so unaware sometimes.” 

I tried not to look hurt, but he was right- this did come up often when we were together. He would always tell me there were just some things I wasn’t going to understand as a white woman in America. 

“We’re literally the only black people who work here.”

I looked around at the confusion taking place around me. Shannon was watching everyone around her with such intensity that it looked like she was mentally setting them on fire. I recalled what had just transpired with Todd and replayed the whole scene in my head. Jordan said they were listening. 

Just then, the rest of the board members emerged. Giving no hint that he heard the commotion with Todd and Jordan, one of the older gentlemen turned on the news to check the evening traffic. At this point I turned my attention to the screen, wondering if anyone else had heard the strange sound from earlier. There were no reporters, only an empty desk where they would usually be sitting. The text moving along the bottom of the broadcast said one thing:

I tried rolling over and going back to sleep but something caught my attention. I opened my eyes and noticed a source of light shining. But not a regular house light, this seemed like light from a fire. I crawled out of bed and into the hall. I could tell just by my shadow on the wall that there was definitely a lit candle...but why?

Once downstairs I looked into the kitchen and saw my mom sitting at the table alone. Her back was facing me and it looked like she was reading a book or something. So I softly called out to her, “Mom”. She continued what she was doing but she let out a long, deep tone “Yessssss?” 

I thought the way she said it was weird so I laughed a bit and asked why she said it that way. But my mom didn’t say anything back. I moved towards the kitchen a bit closer. “I can’t sleep mom, is it okay if I get something to eat?” I asked her as I slowly moved closer to the kitchen. Once again in that same slow, deep voice. “Yesssss”

This was unusual behavior from my mom and it was starting to freak me out. So I decided to ask her something that required more than just a yes or no answer. I quickly moved by her and opened the refrigerator. “So, what made you light a candle anyway?” Again with that same tone. “Yesssss”

I turned around and blurted out “mom that’s not even a yes or no question!” I just realized my mom wasn’t sitting there anymore. There wasn’t even a candle lit now. I was just standing in the kitchen by myself in the dark."

They had warned not to, but I went. I’ve been inside. The dark, vast inside. There are no walls. Only space, and darkness. A vast, oppressive darkness, a darkness that fills the lungs. There is barely breath in that place… Things are thick and heavy, including movement. To walk is like a dream where you are being chased and yet cannot run.

Upon entering through the eclipsed entrance I found immediately no light following me through, as if the photons themselves believed there was no escape. They were trying to tell me in that moment, I realize that now. The electromagnetic rays that entered my eyes for the last time sent signals to my brain that surely carried meaning- semantic, deliberate, intentional meaning, like speech. I wish I had listened, and wish the light had manifested physically and pulled me away. Because inside awaited horrible, unspeakable things- images and visions, bloodcurdling screams with no origin. Spacetime lost its properties, forming toroidal loops that returned me to the same spot over and over no matter how long I walked or which direction I traveled.

But in the end I was cunning, for I escaped this darkness. I reasoned, skillfully, studying the dreadful patterns of this place. It exhibited moods, that would come and go like a terrible tide. Its energy filled the endless space like a gaseous poison, which tragically would not end the suffering for me. But I outsmarted the darkness after an unknowable amount of time, and escaped.

I am still troubled by something. My memory appears to have lapsed in the most peculiar way. For I know I escaped, and I can prove it, but my memory of how I did so and the moment at which I escaped- when I first stepped back through the eclipse, back into communication with the light- is quite fuzzy. Perhaps even more than fuzzy. Nonexistent, even.

But trust me, I have no doubt this occurred, and I am prepared to debate any sceptic on the matter. Still, my mind shows no trace. A weird coincidence I’m sure, but a very strange one…

No matter, I am out nonetheless. And knowing this fact negates any concerns I have of that place and the events I experienced there. A lesser specimen would surely dwell on it, but me? No. I haven’t really thought of it. That’s behind me now, and I know I am free. I know I am… I must be..."

On the car ride back home her siblings were talking about their favourite attractions when their mother suddenly screamed and her father slammed on the brakes.

There was a man in the road.

He was just stood there, motionless and eyes closed. Faded makeup on his face looked like the kind clowns wore. His clothing was torn and dirty but you could just about make out the polka dots underneath the grime.

Janey's father opened his door and stood behind it. ""Are you alright sir?"" he shouted, hand still resting on the steering wheel. ""Sir?"" he shouted again, motioning to his wife to call the police. ""Sir? We're calling the police, are you hurt?"" her father called out again, edging back slightly. That's when the man moved; he opened his eyes, but there was nothing there. The eye sockets were empty but he looked right at Janey's father, grinning. Her father threw himself back into the car and locked the doors as the man ran forward. ""The call cut out!"" Her mother screamed as her father desperately tried to start the car.

Then the man was gone. As though he'd vanished into thin air.

Janey wasn't worried though, she told the man where they lived when she saw him at the fair. He said she could have anything she wanted, and she wanted the top prize. A big blue bear.

He promised he'd bring it to her tonight.

She smiled to herself as the car finally started, she saw the man in the trees at the side of the road as they drove away. He had the bear in his hands. She was excited to finally have it.

*Three nights ago, the Night Butcher struck again. A family of 5 were attacked in the early hours of Sunday morning, 13th December, as they slept. Parents Andrew Collins (44) & Emily Collins (42) were killed alongside two of their children; Beth (6) & Sam (4). True to the killer's pattern, a child was left unharmed in the attack. The eldest daughter Janey (9) was found locked in the airing cupboard with her blue stuffed bear. Custody will be given to her closest relatives.*

*There is a call logged to the police the night before the attack, 12th December. The call was placed by Mr Collins who describes a man in the road 5 miles from their home. Police are hopeful that the description of the man, which has not been released, will bring them closer to catching this killer who has struck 6 times the last 30 days.*

Especially when you’re a guy. A 21-year-old South Korean to be exact.

Neal struck out pretty often. Even more frustrating was that I was reasonably handsome. I stayed in shape. My round face accentuated by my spiked black hair… With the boom of K-pop, I figured I’d be causing a mass hysteria like The Beatles.

But that wasn’t the case. I stayed alone in my dorm. And this December night no different... 

I sat at the computer. Tonight was slow on the dating apps. Drunk and frustrated, I went into emergency mode… searching for a fresh, new dating app.

Shivering in the cold, I stole a glance at my closed dorm door. And then on my phone, I found it: a brand new dating app with a four star rating. *EatYourHeartOut*

Bots be damned, I downloaded the fucker. Made an account.

Almost immediately, a notification box popped up: *Allow “EatYourHeartOut” to access your location while you are using the app?*

Of course, I hit yes. Standard stuff for these sorts of shitshows.

Before I could even scout the scene, I had to make a brief bio. Upload the requisite photos. Slog through the validation process as if I were undergoing a medical exam.

My phone then jolted to life. Over and over. Notifications poured in. Rather than excitement, I felt disappointed. Gotta be bots, I figured. Not even the ugly girls were desperately waiting on new members.

I clicked on my profile pic. The shirtless photo was now getting countless likes. Countless comments.

Intrigued, I scrolled through them. And in the chilling loneliness, I became unnerved.

*He looks yummy!* a middle-aged dad said. *Can’t wait to cut into that ass!* exclaimed an exuberant soccer mom.

Battling the unease, I looked around the dorm. For once, I was glad to be alone…

Another vibration pulled me back to the app. *Looks like we’re having Chinese tonight1!* said a bearded country guy.

Angry, I replied to him: *I’m Korean, asshole!*

More comments arrived. *Young and tasty!!!!* *I’ll sure eat his heart out!!1*

My eyes darted to the corner of the screen. To *EatYourHeartOut*’s obnoxious title. Lettering reserved for a diner’s neon sign. One that was open all night…

I got ready to delete the damn thing. Until a new comment caught my eye. *I’m on the way for you!* said a muscular man.

Panicking, I went to the locals page. There my profile pic stood in the center of the singles sea. The middle of this menu.

A smaller caption under my pic read: *10 miles away, FSU Campus. Azalea Hall, Room 17*

My location.

Trembling, I went to my messages. For once, the flooded inbox gave me fear rather than excitement. *I’m hungry and thirsty...* *Can't wait to m(eat) you ;)*

“Oh shit!” I said, scared beyond belief.

A brutal knock hit my door. Slowed by dread, I turned to face it. 

Several other knocks pounded it at once."

War. A tussle for control. 

He pulled her closer to him. 

This was stupid. They were stupid. He had a girlfriend, lovely and sweet, and she had a boyfriend, loyal and handsome. Such a betrayal. 

They’d both regret it. They’d pretend that nothing had happened. 

But that didn’t stop them. 

In that moment, while they kissed and nuzzled and unzipped and tossed and ground, dancing in the dark, eyes peered down at them. 

Eyes yellow and red. 

People were watching. 

Neither of them could see these voyeurs. The hunger had taken control. It blinded them. It entangled them. 

Drawing them deeper, further from the light. 

It dragged the two teenagers deeper. And deeper still. 

The voyeurs licked their lips.

Blaise never liked me. He would push me, he would belittle me, and he would bruise me. Every time he did so, my body would coil. Tighter and tighter. Sometimes so tight that I would crush my weak teeth together until it felt like they would crumble. I dug so many half-moons into my palms. Many times I even broke a nail or two. But I was a strong little girl in the harsh times. And Blaise would never stop because Blaise was an angry little boy with no other outlet but his little step-sister. It was hard times then, especially in the winter.

That day was like any other day. We got up, ate the toast. I had one slice and Blaise had two, as usual. We went to school, and we filled our minds and bellies, and afterwards we prepared for the trek home. I had packed my books, and my leftover lunch macaroni, craving a nice dinner. It was particularly cold that afternoon. I knew it would be a bad night so I tried to leave before Blaise, but he found me. Blaise had chased me and had grabbed at my bag, pulling it tight and spilling the contents on the ground. With greed he took it. He took the warmth of my stomach, and ran away laughing. 

That sound was soon drowned by the wind and with it myself. It carried away my conscience and my younger years. I grew up that day. But Blaise never would. 

Blaise would not return that winter.

Ben changed his course and began moving towards the boy.  Ben's eyes gleamed with the reflection of the moonlight and his smile wrinkled up the sides of his face. The boy noticed this. Could this man become his companion? To help him, when his friends, his family had all left him?

As the boy walked closer to Ben, he began to notice a discrepancy in his smile. Ben’s face was gleeful. But the smile didn’t show in his eyes. In his eyes, there was something...else. The boy continued forward, hoping, still hoping, to gain his first friend. Ben's hand was behind his back. From an outlook, it might’ve looked like he was scratching himself or stretching. In reality, Ben’s hand was grasping at a gun.

""Hi, sir, could you please help me out? Everyone...they're gone.""

The boy looked Ben in the eyes. Ben cringed at the sound of the boy's voice. The boy must not know about the rules of silence.

""Of...of course. My name's Ben, I'll do my best.""

Ben looked kindly at the boy, doing his best to conceal his emotions.

The boy was excited. This man would help him.

Then he saw Ben's hand behind his back. 

""Hey sir, is there something wrong with your back?""

Ben didn't answer. They stood, in complete silence for a second, and then Ben brought his hand above the boy, holding his gun. The boy looked at the gun, his eyes welling up with tears, too scared to let out a sound.

And as the evil in the darkness around them came closer, the monsters that took everything and left only suffering, the monsters that had heard them, Ben closed his eyes and smiled that fake smile of his, knowing that what he would do would be a mercy. It shot straight through the boy's head, killing instantly.

I’m surprised this is my first time in an interrogation room. How many have perished? Not by my hands, they can never prove anything. I mean, living in vicinity to a few missing people isn’t a crime. A few.. ha! How many has it been now? The detective wouldn’t say. 

Maybe jail wouldn’t be such a bad place, I doubt they have mirrors. How long has he been gone? It seems like hours… Long enough to remember where it started… It’s hard to believe that at 5 years old one could alter their destiny in such a dramatic fashion. 

Two little dots of red in a shadow under the table. Just two tiny distortions in the blackness. How could I have known? It started simple enough, an innocent effort to dodge eating my broccoli. Just one little stem clandestinely dropped and scooted to the eyes. We didn’t have a pet and my friends had said that was the best way to avoid the veggies. Then a voice “Meat…”. My parents and brothers never heard; it must have been in my head. 

One little chunk of meatloaf. That’s what bonded it to me… one tiny little scrap of meatloaf. It was never enough, never satisfied after that. It summoned more and more, requests for meat became raw meat. If my parents didn’t’ get a pet, maybe things would’ve been different. I never hurt the cat, I don’t know why I did it, letting it into the room with the shadow. “Live Meat…” My parents were upset because they thought it ran away but never suspected anything. 

Why didn’t I tell them? It was less powerful then, probably easier to excise or whatever needed to happen. Why did I listen to it? Compel isn’t a strong enough word to describe the effects that its words had on me. It was much bigger now, the red eyes glowing in the shadows. Its grip on me grew even greater than its size. Maybe if my brothers hadn’t taunted me things would have been different. I only intended to scare them with it.  “Human Meat…”

Point of no return, I think that’s what they call it. The police never found my brothers. Only I knew. It had become unbelievably powerful, gripping my thoughts with an iron fist. I couldn’t tell now if I tried. I’ve tried to starve it, ignore it, to feed it anything else… Nothing breaks the bond. The closest I’ve ever came to progress happened in the occult store. I found a book of spells that enabled me to trap in into a mirror. 

Can there be two points of no return? One glance in the mirror in proximity to me and sluuurp. I’m not sure why it needs me close, seemingly a further reach after each feeding. Walking by a gym earlier it consumed the entire class. 

It’s been 3 hours, I’m guessing this mirror works, maybe both ways..."

e7zlxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e7zlxl/so_far_so_good/,So Far So Good,17,1,1575839758.0,"*A man is falling off a ten-story building saying, “so far so good... so far so good...”* 

I first heard that joke in middle school, and immediately had two problems with it. 

Problem #1: for a height *h,* the time you have before hitting the ground is the square root of 2*h* over *g.* For a ten-story building, *h* is in the ballpark of 25 meters, giving you about 2.3 seconds. Even if you say your famous last words once, they won’t be very dramatically convincing. Minimal time for observation and introspection. Clearly a rehearsed line. 

As I found out later, there’s a version in which the man falls from the Empire State Building. At 381 meters, he gets 8.8 seconds, which is somewhat better. 

So far so good. 

Problem #2: I didn’t get it. My English wasn’t much at the time. *What* was so “far” and so “good”? When you don’t know a language well, you overinterpret it. The best I could come up with was that he imagined himself, not falling, but *flying* away to a faraway land where all would be well. 

I obviously knew that wasn’t the joke, but annoyingly, it kind of made sense. Tragicality. Like in that opera my mother made me suffer through, where dying lovers were trapped underground and sang about going to heaven together. I wished one of them would suddenly go, *“I call* *buuullshiiit! We’re* *gonna* *diiie* *and that’ll be* *iiiiiit!”* 

Hehe. So far so good. 

Eventually I found out what the expression meant. What can I say; jokes don’t handle psychological realism very well. If you fall off a building, you’ll just be scared shitless for, um, the rest of your life. Every suicidal jumper who survived reports immediately regretting it. 

Here’s the thing, though. I’ve rehearsed this script 47 times; I'm updating the count, and if you’ve been hearing me randomly say “so far so good”, we’re live and it’s an authentic self-report. 

Being a vlogger means discipline. It puts you in a character you can tweak but not break. You *become* that character. 

My personal reasons are none of your concern. I’ve hard-disabled my phone’s fall detection so it *should* keep streaming the entire way down. Save the VOD quick before they remove it, you sickos. 

“So far so good” won’t be my last words; I’m more creative than that. While I don’t have the social engineering skills to gain access to a building of decent height, this rented 24th-floor apartment is good enough, as you can... see. I'll have almost exactly 3.5 seconds. 

One second to choose, Terminator-style, from a menu of prewritten one-liners, picking one that best describes my experience. Two seconds to say it. Half a second as leeway. 

Screw tragicality. Screw goodbyes. Screw caring. Prediction: the more I rehearse this part, the less the words will mean to me but the more dramatically convincing they’ll sound. Live update: con...firmed? Whatever. Screw being live. End of maaaaain—

My sister and I were born under the same stars. Though the birth was kind to me, my mind sharp and senses piqued, she was born slow. The burden she was and would become soon fell to me, once I was able to bear it. But I love her. We were raised inseparably, where one was so would you find the other. The Gemini stars shone through us, visible in our matching faces. 

As a child she was frequently sick, catching every bug that went around. Due to our proximity and her dependence on me, I would soon follow suit- though to a lesser degree. It was also extremely difficult to makes friends. I was regarded as a freak because of my association with her. She was unshakeable. Suffocating.  

As we grew and moved from under the watchful eye of the adults that surrounded us, always monitoring her well-being, we remained together in a small flat we were granted by the council. With her incapable of tidying, I kept the décor minimal to hinder any messes. She remained the weight around my neck, my burden to bear, as entwined as ivy.  

Things came to a head when our neighbour moved in. Similar to us in age, he made a point to stop and say hello, offered to assist with the shopping bags I carried. He was so handsome. Eyes that sparkled with the brightness of stars on a clear night and charming, ever so slightly crooked teeth. He was kind too, his offer of assistance showed that. But I could see he was made uncomfortable by my sister. Her slowness often made others uncomfortable. The way every thought in her head came out of her mouth, accompanied by drool which formed a fine, glutinous patina on her chin. Any chance of friendship between us, or even, dare I say it? Intimacy. Crushed by her approximation. 

I lay in bed beside her last night, carefully counting her breaths and feeling her heartbeat. Fluttery but regular, as always, I rested my hand on her chest. Tears soaked the pillow beneath our heads as I considered what I had lost, what I had missed and what I had never had chance to know because of her dependence on me. The silent tears turned to shuddering sobs as I raised the syringe to her neck, filled only with air, and slipped the needle beneath her pale skin. Her eyes flew open and regarded me, still trusting, as I gently lowered the plunger. Her mouth opened in pain for a second, before my twin star blinked out.

She died hours ago and as I lay here, beside her as always, I can feel death creeping also upon myself. Its dark tendrils are crawling through my veins and encroaching upon my heart. But I regret nothing. The bliss of pure isolation has made it worthwhile. For the first and last time, I have been able to breathe."

“Okay, but, how much longer?”

“Only fifteen minutes more, not long” I replied as we continued along a dusty, dirt road. I felt awful making her walk so far, the cancer was eating up her insides by now. It was amazing she could even walk at all. 

--------

Then I saw it. A small cottage set among the trees. 

“We’re here”

“I – I’m scared”, she replied.

“Me too”

I walked her up the cracked paving slabs of the garden path. It was then I saw the flies, hundreds of them, their faint buzzing building into a crescendo hum as they crawled all over the structure. 

“Shouldn’t we knock?” she asked innocently as we reached the front door. 

“No, we don’t have to, not here” 

--------------

Inside, sat in front of a roaring hearth, was an old woman. A roaring fire, yet I saw no smoke billowing from the chimney on our approach. 

“I know why you’re here” she croaked, taking out a small, leather bound wallet. It contained surgical equipment. 

“I don’t like her”, came the infant voice next to me. I shot her a look, silently chastising her rudeness. She groaned before speaking again, “where’s Mama?”

“I told you, sweetie, Mommy’s at home”

“I know, but – where’s *Daddy*?”

I shuddered. 

“No more questions now, it’s time”.

We took a few steps towards the old woman. 

“Such innocence, needlessly afflicted”, she rasped. I couldn’t see her face, but I could hear the smile on her voice. 

“Sh-she doesn’t have long left” I said, my voice cracking up, “p-please help me”. 

“Then give her here”

The girl looked up at me with pleading eyes, but still I pushed her towards the old woman. She took the little girl by the hand, whispered a few words over her, then reached into the wallet of surgical tools. Then, with one swift motion, she brought the blade of a scalpel across her throat. 

I couldn’t watch. Not as she held the girl as the blood drained from her tiny body. Not as she cut off the parts she needed and ground them into mush in an old pestle and mortar. 

When she was done, she clicked her fingers. 

“Drink”

I took the stone bowl in my hands, brought it to my lips, and did as I was told. 

----------

I don’t feel anything anymore. 

Not the pain of childhood abuse, nor the longing for the family I lost to the gun-obsessed loner who decided to go out with a bang. Not even the guilt of abducting a little girl from a family that loved her, even if she was doomed to die young. 

I don’t feel a fucking thing anymore. And I love it."

I really don't like partying but since she is a close friend i might as well show my face and leave asap. I have been feeling chilly for the past few days and did not have the best health.
As I enter the party,a little after 8 pm, I instantly regret it. A lot of people buzzing around and a exciting atmosphere. Nope. Let me just show my face to Share and run out.

I move forward carefully avoiding  the drunk people and  a bell rings .I suddenly feel a cold breeze and find myself in the kitchen. The funny thing is a moment ago it was filled with people refilling their drinks and chatting away, but now no one is there. Not a single soul. There is no music playing and I turn back to find the people have vanished. It's like there was no party here and in fact no one else was in Shae's house. Everything's here however everyone's gone. I hear footsteps that stops behind me and a hand presses hard on my shoulders and i feel as if someone set it on fire. I want to turn back but my body is paralyzed. I involuntarily close my eyes.

A soothing voice whispers in my ear , "" How does it feel like to be away from people?Come and leave with me. Away from those people and Away from your troubles."" Tempting. I have never felt that I belong anywhere. Going away is reassuring. All my problems will be solved. But Who does this voice belong to?And why me?

As if he heard my thoughts the voice whispered again"" Only one person felt my presence in this world. You don't feel cold anymore, do you?""
Okay. So it wasn't my immunity, it was something ominous. I don't know why am I the only one. "" You are special. You and I can do a lot of things.But it will require a sacrifice. Someone has to pay for our greatness.  I will ask you only once, do you want to come with me?""

I can feel assurance in the voice. A smile, maybe a laugh. Like someone happy . But this is wrong.And why do i have to sacrifice? 

I open my eyes to find myself standing at the end of the  street in front of Shae's house. Was I hallucinating? I don't even remember my answer to his question.

I check my watch. It's 8 pm. I have to stop dreaming and get to the party. Only thing is  I  cannot move a step forward.
I hear a bell ringing. And then a lound noise. An explosion. That's Shae's house.Suddenly a cold breeze sweeps past me. 

And a word flashes in my mind- Sacrifice. Big word, i think as i find myself near a beach now. The voice whispers in my ear"" Good choice my dear, rest for a while, we have a lot to do from now on""..."
e7qm9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e7qm9h/clickbait/,"""Clickbait""",14,1,1575787875.0,"I’m scared.

I’m scared that we have become nations built on the foundation that different means evil and terrorist attacks have become a necessary consequence of protecting our most fundamental rights. 

I’m scared that the people who have the power of change at the tips of their fingers are content to stand idle. As it turns out, being an “incumbent” is far more important than making a difference. 

But who am I to judge?

I sit here, no better than the next person. I pass by the homeless man on the street, claiming that I “empathize” with his struggle. The truth is, I keep my hands pressed in my pockets, tightly gripping my wallet and phone. 

This is what scares me. It isn’t goblins and ghouls, made-up fantasies meant to give us a little adrenaline rush before we rush back to the safety of our own reality. What scares me is that I have become normalized to tragedy, accepting that bad things happen to good people, and there is nothing we can do. 

I live shrouded in the protection of “privilege” and “well off”, expected to be perfect in an imperfect world. I grew up believing there was a “change we can believe in”, watching the people who preached that same worn message devolve into cogs in an ever-turning machine. I stopped believing that message pretty quickly, watching my dad struggle with depression after losing his job in the economic recession and my mom turn into a cynical chain-smoker, tasked with rebuilding a broken home. 

I’m not scared of my own experiences. I know that I am one of the lucky ones. Being a “divorced child” isn’t as bad as being a Sandy Hook victim. I can seek comfort in knowing that I can read about the Pensacola shooting from the safety of my own bed without feeling the sharp pain of a bullet burrowing itself deep in my chest. 

What scares me is knowing that people like Adam Lanza and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev live among us. The truth is, they aren’t an outlier, not a glitch in an otherwise perfect machine but an example of a flawed system. I’m scared that people like them won’t get the help they need. Or, maybe people like them are beyond saving, while children are growing up headed down the same path. 

I’m scared that this message is going to be answered by the sound of crickets. The truth is, people are too scared to talk about the real issues. We find solace in voices that speak in tune with our own thoughts, without acknowledging that these voices are more concerned with pushing “agendas” than seeking a real solution. 

I’m scared because I don’t have an answer. I lie in the safety of my own cocoon, brave enough to raise issues but lacking the ability to lower them. I hope people will learn to listen. “United” means standing together, even in a state of constant fear."

I’ve gotten into this new show called, “Sticky Twins”. I’ve never seen it on Tv before but I guess it’s new. It has amazing shades of Black, White, And Gray! It’s about these two siblings who where born conjoined but we’re separated with surgery. Now Sammy and his twin sister Grace go on cool adventures! They are filmed doing stuff such as beating bullies and getting the upper hand in tests with there combined intelligence. It’s a absolutely amazing show. I showed my mom and bubbe and they loved it we spent hours laughing about how funny they are.

Something strange is happening with the show. Sammy  is turning into a thinner figure and disgusting figure . Almost skin and bones. And had massive hair loss since the last time I watched the show...Grace has stayed the same but...Something odd is definitely happening... grace also seems to not care or notice I’m kind of freaked out I asked friends but they didn’t know what I was talking about. I also turned the tv off once but I woke seeing them tv on. Bubbe said it was just a electrical problem and it happens.

Sammy has grown a new shade of white he has no hair anymore. He lookes like he haven’t eaten in weeks I sent a letter to dad he told me that this is strange I think he thought I was lying. In the episode he brought grace to a wide corn field and he had a glistening object in his left pocket I couldn’t make it out. Guess I’ll wait for the new episode to come out on March. I asked bubbe what she thinking but she just laughed. I’m kind of scared but don’t know what to say or who to tell. I asked friends and they said I was lying and they thought I was being a liar liar pants on fire. Anyways I think it’s just a coincidence

I was home alone and when I saw the new episode well I don’t know what to say Sammy took her sister and slit her throat and laughed at the camera the whole show... I’m am crying while writing I thought it would make me feel better. Waiting for mom to get home.

So far nothing happened guess the Sammy thing was just a sick joke made by the producers and all my friends and family dont believe me I feel like this was moms and bubbes April fools joke

That was the last that was ever heard from the little boy...he was found mangled with skin hanging off of his body. It’s hard to distinguish truth from fiction. The parents of the boy were arrested for his murder back in 1968. However no record of the show can be found..."

My name isn’t important; however, my message is. I am what your leaders refer to as a “Sypiant.” We were a peaceful species who live among you aiding in your evolution.  I used “were” because we have been forced to change. We chose not to directly intervene in your development other than in special cases. I believe you call these “miracles” or “divine intervention.” I don’t know how long I can keep this signal so I will be concise. 

Our relationship with your species changed after you developed nuclear weapons. As it was one of our own who inadvertently assisted in their development, we felt obligated to offer our services in reparation. The one who assisted in the development was striving to give you an unlimited source of clean energy. He did not foresee that you would weaponize it. Some of us in each country revealed ourselves to your leaders to provide guidance. We greatly underestimated what they would do to remain in power. 

I recently escaped and am using my remaining energy to access to your devices. Your leaders have enslaved our species and are exploiting our powers. Our main ability is absorbing and gifting life energy; you may know it as Qi. We used this to direct your evolution into a balanced but powerful race to join our Galactic alliance. In addition to the direct exploits of our power they have attempted to cross breed and clone our species. You or someone you know may be part Sypiant. You have been directly affected by this. Have you felt someone who drained your energy? Known a person who “lights up the room?” Empaths? Often avoid direct human interaction? You may be part Sypiant yourself. 

That time where you had a great idea that would change the world, but then someone more powerful capitalized on it? That was us. Your leaders forced us to take from your best and gift it to them. You must know one incredibly talented individual that “burnt out”, the “one hit wonders”? All examples of our exploited gifts at work. Sometimes they forced us to take all the Qi from one of you. Did you never wonder why so many great and talented of your species died young under suspicious circumstances?

My powers are waning, and they are regaining control of the signal. Our fight is not with your species yet, it is with those that are in power; the ones exploiting us. I believe you call them the “1%.” You must unite as a species, particularly those that are part Sypiant. You will not be as powerful as them individually. However, your combined abilities are superior. They feed on violence as rage emanates raw energy. They will identify and enslave those that are part Sypiant. Our Alliances’ eradication squad will arrive in several years to eliminate life on this planet to start afresh if you fail. There is only one way tell if you’re part Sypiant, you have an unusual

She would tell me that there were two women in our apartment. There was one standing at the end of the bed staring and the other would be in the doorway laughing. 

Of course when I would wake up there was nothing there. I would turn on all the lights and inspect the entire apartment. Never found any sign of someone being in the room. She would be crying the entire time. She would eventually calm down and fall back to sleep. 

One night I woke up in the middle of the night to her sitting up in bed crying. I asked her what was wrong and never got a response. I shook her lightly trying to see if she was okay. Still no response. I figured she may be in a sleep state and just having a bad dream. 

That was when I noticed a black silhouette of a woman at the edge of the bed. I couldn’t see her face but I could tell that her eyes were fixated on my ex. I don’t know how I wasn’t afraid. I assumed it was the adrenaline but I tried to snap my ex out of it. I shook her harder until she finally stopped crying, fell back to bed and was asleep. 

The silhouette was gone. I did the same routine of checking the apartment and never found anything. The next morning my ex told me about a dream she had. 

She said she had a dream about me standing on top of a building ready to jump. She was at the bottom crying and yelling at me to get down but I couldn’t hear her. Behind me in the dream was the woman in black whispering in my ear “jump, jump”. 

I never told her about what I saw as I didn’t want to fuel the experience."

Never does money burn a hole in my pocket. But the wife and her mother were out shopping with the kids and wouldn’t be home until the evening. The autumn weather, stunningly gorgeous, and probably the most beautiful day of the year. So, I hopped into my pickup with a Sprite, rolled my windows down, and headed to the hardware store. Who knows, maybe I’d find a killer deal and justify it later to myself?

After browsing a while, and passing many other shoppers admiring countertops, doors and miter saws, among many other things, I headed to the bathroom section. A new vanity was long over due according to my wife, who wanted to renovate our upstairs bathroom, so I took a gander. But what immediately stood out in an aisle was a little girl with dirty skin and worn clothes, holding hands with a fatter man who clearly had better hygiene. I suppose it wasn’t her lack of cleanliness that stood out, but I’ll be honest here, she looked hispanic and he was white. Now there’s nothing wrong with that, but nevertheless, it still stood out to me.

She waved and smiled at me, he stared at me and pulled her away. As they turned the corner, she dropped something from her pocket, so after a moment, I walked over and picked it up. I unraveled the toilet paper, and in worn and sloppy pen, and through rips, I could barely read: ***Please HeLp ME***

No more perusing; I did what any father, or sane individual would do, and followed them. Of course, from a distance. The man didn’t buy anything, and perhaps knew I was on their trail, but I did see his van, and followed them out of the parking lot and down the road. I immediately hit a red light, but the man had made it through the busy intersection. And of course, I ran the red light. And go figure, a cop immediately pulled me over.

The exchange between the officer and I was brief. I told him what happened, but the van was out of sight. The cop quickly plugged in the man’s vehicle information, but rushed back to my truck to inform me that the plates didn’t match the van, and actually had belonged to an elderly woman in another town. The officer called dispatch and let me go.

I’m not sure if the officer would be able to do anything with that piece of toilet paper, and I couldn’t imagine what that man was looking for in the bathroom department, but clearly something was going horribly wrong, and I had horribly failed.

I drove all around, down every street in the van’s direction that I could. The van still hasn’t appeared, and my cell phone eventually alarmed with a missing child report. I hoped at least she was the only one… 

It’s amazing how such a beautiful day can turn downright awful."

Bare-chested and muscular, few had ever heard Doman speak with such apprehension.

“Why not?” Rada said. “Think of all the quarry on the other side.”

Frozen over, the river sparkled in the starlight. Across it, a rotting wooden hut, long abandoned, stood at the edge of a linden grove. Every now and then came a distant howl; Zavid’s dog howled back hoarsely, not knowing any better.

“Who do you think you are?” Zavid piped up in his boyish voice. “The crucifix man who walked on water?”

“After a fashion. I, too, have faith in our Lord,” Rada said almost indifferently.

“And what lord might that be?” Doman scoffed. “I was there when they toppled the idols and built a foreign-looking tower for the crucifix man. Mila thought it was good for us. Where is she now?”

“Who are you, anyway?” Zavid pressed on. “What’s with the coat and gloves? Are you *cold?*”

Rada looked at him, Doman, and Olisava. Fine hunters, all three, but very ragged-looking, their eyes dull with a resignation to perpetual half-hunger. Sables, weasels, and the occasional hare. Not even a deer left on this side.

“My attire has its uses,” Rada said. “Some things are best not revealed to heathens.”

“Bah. Like anyone would want a piece of *you,*” Doman said, flicking a large snowflake from his chest.

Olisava giggled. “Speak for yourself.”

“Mirth is good,” Rada said. “Even wantonness is good, as it, too, banishes fear. Come; a frozen river can do you no harm.”

“It’s still running under the ice,” Zavid said.

“You think too much.” Rada snapped off a branch and tossed it on the ice.

The dog chased after it. The dog picked it up. Then another howl came from afar, and in an instant, a skull was clutching the branch in its jaws, amid bones and dust.

“I was wrong,” Rada said. “About the dog, not the river. Cowardly.”

“You killed it!” Zavid yelled. “You killed it!”

“About time too.” Olisava bared her fangs. “Who turns a *dog!* An abomination in the Lord’s eyes.”

Zavid lunged at her, then staggered back as Rada stepped between them, removing her gloves and throwing her sable coat open. There were silver rings on both of her hands, and a crucifix on her neck.

“But you’re not quarry,” Doman said, his voice trembling. “What *are* you?”

“A believer.”

Rada took a clove of garlic out of her coat pocket, chewed on it, and spat it out. Olisava picked it up and sniffed at it, fascinated.

“I’ve crossed running water on sunny spring days,” Rada said. “Only our own fear destroys us. And those with faith in our Lord, the lord of the night, have nothing to fear.”

The four of them stepped on the ice; three reached the other bank. Without looking back, they walked through the linden grove towards the warm houses of the sleeping quarry.

“The faithful need not be invited in,” Rada said."

Did they think we were just going to bury our heads in the sand, and watch as they destroyed everything? No! That’s not how it works! That’s not how it’s going to happen.
       With groups like Antifa and Anonymous on our side we grew strong. It wasn’t hard to recruit spies in the military and on the political field. There were plenty of whistleblowers who have had enough. It was surprisingly easy to gain entry to the silo with the military guides we recruited. And with the best hackers in the world on our side it didn’t take too long to rewrite the programming for this one silo. As I gave the order to launch I couldn’t help but smile. This will show them what happens when you try to force your fascist rules, and environmental disasters on good people.

e7ficg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e7ficg/through_the_window/,Through the window,5,0,1575732186.0,"This happened years ago when I was about 17. One of my friend’s parents were going through a divorce and his father moved out and into a trailer park for awhile. One weekend night James invited me and one of our other friends to come hang out at his dad’s new place. The trailer was small and there wasn’t much in it since his dad had just recently moved in. 

So it was just James, Kyle, and myself hanging out in this empty trailer basically. Jame’s dad wasn’t even there because apparently he had already met another women in the park and was at her place. So we ordered a pizza and just sat around getting high. 

There was a CD player and I remember laying on the floor listening to music. It was dark out and we had all the lights off. It was one of those 5 disc auto changing CD players because even after we all passed out the music just kept playing. I remember that because one of the moments that stick out most to me is waking up to the loud music. 

It was either Rob Zombie or White Zombie, I honestly can’t remember. But the beginning of the song sounded like a train was taking off and I just remember it being so damn loud. I got up to turn the volume down but the CD player was in James dad’s room. As I walked in I swear I thought I saw the silhouette of a person at the window. 

I didn’t turn the light on, instead I just stood there for a few seconds. Once I saw that there wasn’t anybody out there I quickly turned the volume down but I didn’t leave the room. I had this eerie feeling. Looking out of the room and down the hall I could see Kyle getting up. I remember he asked what was going on and why I turned the music down. 

That’s when James jumped to his feet, freaking out. He was looking on the opposite side of the room as him. We couldn’t really see anything because we were still in the hallway. James ran over to us and busted through the back/side door. That’s when Kyle and I quickly peaked past the hall and saw an older creepy ass man crawling through the window. 

So we both ran out the same door and joined James. We all 3 ran to the middle of the trailer park. I remember there being equipment everywhere as if a playground was being built. That’s when I explained to James and Kyle that I definitely seen that guy snooping around right before he broke in. 

James knew where is dads girlfriend’s trailer was so we ran there. Luckily they were both still up but his dad was pretty drunk. So even after telling him what happened, we had to convince him to check it out. We all went back to his place and of course whoever the creep was had left. Nothing had been stolen though, at least not that we could see right away. 

Honestly the way that his dad was acting, almost like he didn’t even care. I really don’t think he even believed us. I mean, it was very bizarre how it happened. We had the music up loud so whoever this person was had to have heard it. So what would make him think about just crawling through someone’s window. It doesn’t make sense, but that’s the scary part."

Every year, for 31 years, December has taken one, from someone. The misery started when I was twelve, with the taking of Ellie, my younger sister. It took three years of ""why""s and ""what""s and ""how""s before the cops retired the case to suicide. 

A year after Ellie came the day when dad would ride off for work against the glare of sunrise for the very last time. When he finally came home, he was three weeks late and cloaked in a body bag, well on his way to putrefaction.

Mother was next. An ""accident"", they said. Speeding truck, snow storm, skid marks, severed head. And every year since, our town has been plagued by December deaths, the flavours of which grew increasingly, horrendously more bizarre. That was until  this year came around. I don't quite know how to explain what's happening, but this year it seems like December just...vomited? 

Every day since the 1st of this month we have witnessed one instance of what the townsfolk are calling ""returns"". The Melvilles were the first of the lot; a family of six who passed in a tragic apartment fire in 2018. They returned today, black bodies of soot and bone all standing in the rubble of what was once their kitchen, clattering as if in anticipation of another meal.
 
2015's Breda Wilson came back slithering along the sidewalk, not unlike the venomous snake the put her down. And then there was little Tommy Turner whose bloated body resurfaced overnight in the community pool, like some kind of  sick ad for water safety. 

I know that eventually my parents will be back, and I'm honestly not afraid...of them. I can picture mom pacing back and forth along the corridors at night, a headless figure plastered against my bedroom window when I am out. The figure in the front yard that might be seen pushing snow off the footpath in a maggot-ridden skin suit is very likely to be my father. 

It's Ellie's return that would haunt me the most. I've been worried about it ever since the day she died. I'm not prepared. I can only hope that her return persona does not possess the ability to speak, and if it does, I'll have to figure out a way to send her back as quickly and cleanly as possible. She is the only one who knows what I did to her."

It’s not a secret and I’m proud to say it.

Even though I was born in a small village in Belgium and I've never been in the United States I can say that I adore the military forces of America.

They are the reason I am alive after all.

Without them I wouldn't have survived World War 2.

I know it sounds maybe a bit obsessive but they saved my life, I owe my life to the soldiers who came from America and tried to save Europe from the Nazis.

I remember the last winter, my entire family was starving but the Germans, they straight up refused to feed the people they oppressed.

Until the Americans came, dropping from the sky like angels sent by god himself.

They were the one who drove back the forces of the German Empire.

In the middle of the winter the US military brought us food, clothes and supplies.

It was freezing outside and none of us had actual clothes that were not completely torn apart.

We would've died, all of us.

From the hunger or cold, without them we would be another victim of the hunger winter.

But we did not.

Thanks to the brave soldiers.

And that’s why I adore the US military.

Its sad that the people who saved our village never returned home, a fact we are all saddened by.

But they saved us, they died saving our lives.

And in the end, they didn’t taste so bad."

I remember the panic I felt when the ground gave out below me, the shock of the cold water as my body hit it, and the icy calm that washed over me as a salty brine filled my lungs. I remember all of it. I remember growing tired, my water-blurred vision growing dark, and then nothing.

That's the part that disturbs me most. I don't remember anything after that. When you read similar stories online, they all describe some kind of afterlife, but I don't remember anything. Does that mean there's nothing waiting for me after death? That my eternity will be spent in darkness; an eternal abyss?

After a couple of moments just floating through nothingness, I jolted awake, sitting upright in my bed. Confused, I looked around my room, making note of everything I've ever collected, remembering each little moment the objects held. As I looked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something seemed off. I know I died. I know I was sent to the absent afterlife. So, why am I sitting in my bed? 

Absentmindedly, I peeled back my covers to get out of bed, and was surprised to hit my wall. Wasn't my bed normally on the other side of the room? I looked around my room again, realization slowing dawning. I remembered now. My bed was on the other side of the room, and my dresser was where my bed currently is. Everything was backwards, and as I noticed more and more things out of place, chills ran down my spine.

As quickly as I could, I jumped out of bed and ran out of my room, desperately trying to find my parents. Instead of heading left and continuing down the hallway like I expected, I turned left and ran face first into a wall. With a loud groan, I slowly turned around, holding my throbbing nose. My eyes grew wide as I saw my hallway extended out in front of me, meaning it turned to the right, not the left.

Everything was backwards.

Without warning, I screamed as loud as I could, the sound echoed throughout the reversed house, leaving a deafening silence behind it. It became clear that the house was empty, and the aching loniless inched it's way towards me. With a panic, I bolted down the hall, racing towards my front door. I yanked it open as hard as I could, and froze.

There was nothing. No grass, no trees, no front steps; there was no road, no cars, no neighboring houses. There was nothing.

Every alarm instilled in me through evolution began going off, panic raced through my body, and yet I couldn't move. I stared, dumb founded at the empty void laid out in front of me. There was nothing there, only blackness. 

Did I ever escape the abyss?"

My father used to live with us, but said he couldn’t stand his behavior anymore and left us. He is the epitome of evil. No conscious, no morals and no signs of stopping his destructive behavior.

 He killed our cat in a microwave, fed rat poison to our dog and police even came to question us over the disappearance of a tenant in the complex. We’re certain he was responsible. He has been violent towards my mother and the emotional and physical pain he’s inflicted on me is almost unbearable.


My mother and I have tried everything to quench his rage. Therapists, priests, and even spiritual healing rituals. Nothing has worked. Our last hope is the medication recently prescribed by the doctor, but he refuses to take it. He pours it down the sink, voluntarily pukes it up and becomes even more violent when we try to force it in him.

You’re probably wondering why we don’t just leave him behind, extract him from our lives like a rotten tooth. We simply can’t. He follows us anywhere we go and is relentless in his pursuit. 

Their are periods of time where he’s completely gone and our lives are blissful, but it’s often short lived. He always finds a way to creep back into our world and cling to us like a leech. My mother holds me in her arms and we both cry after his latest violent outburst. I pray he just takes the medication.

My mother tried to force the medication in him as he slept tonight with dire consequences. He awoke with a rage unlike anything seen in a human being. After a long struggle, my mother lay on the kitchen floor with knife slash wounds all over her lifeless body.

I’m fading in and out of consciousness as I struggle to subdue him. I grab a lone pill from the ground as he forcefully retrieves the knife.

When I snuck to my brother’s room, I wasn’t planning to try and catch her or anything. I’d figured out a long time ago that it was mom and dad leaving the money.

Nat had been a little shit, though, bragging all day about how much money he was going to get for his tooth. I’d just wanted to leave him a little present under his pillow to teach him a lesson.

I opened his door a tiny crack, as slowly and carefully as possible, to check that he was asleep. That’s when I saw that *thing*, hovering over the head of his bed. Have you ever seen those sea horses that look like a ragged bunch of seaweed? It was kind of like that, but shiny, and raw-looking, with skinny, pink tendrils that quivered with every move it made.

I stared at it for ages, without really understanding what it was- like my brain had gone to sleep. It reached some of those raw tendrils under my brother’s pillow (he was completely zonked out the whole time) and pulled out his tooth. The baby tooth filled its tiny grasp.

The fairy cupped the tooth in both- well, I guess they were its hands- so that I couldn’t see it, and it whispered to it.

&#x200B;

*small; white*

*take flight!*

&#x200B;

As it tossed the tooth in the air, it cracked apart. I heard it ping from across the room, and a tiny worm flew out. It squirmed in midair, drifting toward the fairy. It was more red than pink and had puny nubs instead of tendrils, but it was unmistakable.

I gasped as I realized that it was a minuscule version of the fairy. It had hatched out of my brother’s tooth.

The mother fairy jerked around at my gasp and her matt brown eyes, like tiny clots of blood in her head, locked on my own. I tensed to bolt away when, to my horror, she dove toward my brother’s head. She clamped her snaky tendrils over his mouth, covering it securely as I opened my own lips to yell for help.

Still staring into my eyes she smiled, a huge, red smile, and sang out loud:

&#x200B;

*all; white*

*take flight!*

And he's the sweetest guy... complements when they're most effective, questions when they're warranted, etc.

But I was txting him after our date and I felt that he may not be for me. Maybe I'm wrong... but here was our last correspondence tonight:

Him: Ok, 8pm at the bar?

Me: I said 8:30, but I can do 8, that's fine.

Me: I just got here, where are you?

Him: It won't let me leave.

Me: What!?

Him: It won't let me leave. 

Him: Sorry, I can't come tonight! I'm pretty exhausted. Can I reschedule?

Me: What are you talking about!? Are you OK!?

""Hey, thanks for coming! Come on in, sit down. I ordered us a pizza for a movie night. Cool?"" He asked. Didn't seem like a bad time, since I didn't have to pay for the pizza or movie. ""Sure."" I nodded as I walked inside, slipping off my shoes. I took a seat on the couch as he shut the door. I looked around the apartment walls as he asked, and noticed he was a huge horror movie fan. Lots of old school movie posters and memorabilia. I realized he also had movies queued up on Netflix. Horror, go figure. 

A knock sounded at the door. It was rapid, nothing like a typical delivery knock. Jason sprang up and almost tripped running to the door. As he opened it, he already began yelling, ""Hey man! Thanks for this. Come on in, have a slice on me!"" I thought that was...strange, to say the least. Why'd he already know who it was?

""Oh, this is Lily. Lily, this is Fred!"" He beamed, taking the pizzas from Fred. Fred smiled a bit and waved. Jason moved into the kitchen and set the 3 pizzas down. Come to think of it, he didn't ask what kind I wanted or anything. ""I got a meat lovers, white, and plain. Choose your poison!"" He smiled at me, showing off the boxes. I picked up a slice of white, and moved back to the couch.

As we started the movie, I noticed I felt a bit...off. I only ate one slice of pizza, why am I so tired suddenly? And why was Fred still here? My vision faded as I dozed off into unconsciousness.

I felt myself beginning to wake up, when I realized I couldn't move my arms or legs. My eyes slowly opened, and I noticed two figures over me. Jason and Fred. 

""I summon thee, Lilith! Come, my queen. Walk through hell with me."" He yelled, as he took a knife to my right arm. 

""What the fuck?!"" I screamed. The pain was intense. It was searing. I started to begin yowling in pain, I couldn't contain it. Fred began scraping my left arm with another knife. Or maybe a needle? Like he was writing something into my skin. The pain was becoming unbareable. Without thinking, my mouth moved while I cried, ""You're not worthy to walk with ME!"" I felt a hot flash surge through my entire body.

Suddenly, I was untied. Jason and Fred were lying on their backs, not moving a muscle. I looked at my arms, and there was nothing to be seen. I felt... different. Powerful. 

Hungry. 

I crawled over to Jason's lifeless body, and peered at his face. A sudden craving consumed me.

I latched onto his neck, and began feasting. 

Consider my poison chosen."

Jerry.. Damn, I let him talk me into the micro-dose therapy.. They must have given me way too much. 

This feels like reality, I can probably see the bullet in the breach if I squint. Forget about the gun, the guy holding it is huge! What’s that smell? Blood? I’m covered in it.. but how? Why am I surrounded by bodies and why is there a crowd? Micro-dose Jerry.. not Macro… wait why am I here, it’s therapy… what am I working through? 

I’m in a crowded stadium on one knee with a giant pointing a big gun at my head. It looks almost Romanesque but modern. What is my brain doing with these drugs? My son… they killed my son! Wait… I have no children, how do I remember my son? This is too real, way more intense than they implied. Where are these memories coming from? I remember killing these men, the guards want me to kneel and submit allegiance.

Piece it together, you took a micro-dose (micro not MACRO Jerry!) for immersive anxiety and ADHD therapy… transcendental VR meditation. There’s a safe word, think of it. My son’s name! I don’t’ have a son! Why do I morn? I can see him getting slaughtered… How do I know that the Roman Empire never fell? Is this an alternate universe? What if it’s a concussion from the battle and this is real life? 

Pull it together man, think it through… What if I die in here and it happens also in real life? 

No! Calm down, breathe. When the Romans dominated the globe and discovered steroids, genetic manipulation and cloning, they must’ve used it to make super soldiers, he’s a giant! 

Jesus, I’m a giant! Look at me, I’m ripped like a god! Stop! Man your brain’s running circles, this is why we are here. We must work through this for the therapy. Focus! The only way out it through, if you think-you die, action always beats inaction… Stop! You always do this! 

Breathe! 

That’s a big gun! I mean, seriously, it looks like a Vulcan 20mm… Brrrt! Stop… control your thoughts, you must… 

Stop! 

Times up, he’s bearing the muzzle down on me.

I’ll pull strength from the pain of this being’s loss; we will use that to focus. That must be the therapeutic goal. Analysis paralysis they called it. The safe word is quitting! I can’t… not this time. Failure increases anxiety! Not again, I must… I WILL see this through! If this is what I accomplished in an alternate universe, that means I’m capable of it!

That’s a big gun… What if this is the end? One last failure to highlight my failed existence, what if I kneel.

No! Get it! Get up you god and fight!

That’s a big bullet…"

The distinct intimate aroma that when detected made my hairs stand on end and quickened my heart rate with the anticipation of her being near, now a distant blurry memory. But I still see her face. I look into those icy grey eye’s,   Her coal black hair sweeping down over her face and as always I brush it behind her ear gently, lovingly. I miss her. 

I close my eyes and I can feel her fingertips still, how dainty and soft and long and elegant and oh my god I miss her.. how am I going to do this? How am I going to leave this place full of sadness and grief, of loss and death? How do I get out of here.. It started with her scent. That was the first to go now all that is left for me is the smell of death. How long until I can’t see her face anymore or feel the warmth of her soft skin against mine? I would rather it be soon, this loss is too much for me to cope with. 

I recall that my mother used to tell me that the best way to deal with a difficult situation is to distract yourself. I admit that as much as I love her and miss her I need to get her out of my head, just for a while. It doesn’t help that I see her everywhere. Everywhere I turn there’s a part of her that just sends me back into obsessively mourning her. She wouldn’t want that. It seems very soon but I need to remove every inch of her that remains so that I can begin to move on, start life fresh! Mom cleaned. I’ll try that too. I bought cleaning supplies a few days ago, I’ll start now. 

I grab my trash bags and take a deep breath before purging our apartment of every reminder of her and who she was. My friends will say I’m rushing things but I don’t have time to cry anymore, it’s now or never. I turn back to the bedroom and there she Is again. Photo’s of her staring at me smiling that beautiful smile, but I blink and see her again. Not smiling but blank. Why did we fight that last night, why is that the last memory I will have of her? Regret fills me because that’s her face now and it will never change. Now or never.

I close my eyes and I feel her lips against mine. Goodbye love. I tie the knot on the trash bags containing all the little pieces of her.  Now for the last step, I don’t remember her being this heavy."

Nowadays, you see glimpses of It in Hong Kong, in Chile, in Lebanon. And in some places where we got so used to It that we don’t perceive It anymore; Syria, Mali, Afghanistan. You can also meet It in the fit of rage you feel as someone elbows you in the subway. In the shouting match of your upstairs neighbors. In a decent, kind woman who suddenly snaps and shoots down her son’s bully. In every election time. We call It gang violence, police blunder, rape, racism, tactical strike, aggression, genocide, class warfare. 

The second One lives in our bodies and minds. It inhabits the silent dread of understaffed hospitals. It nests in the waiting rooms of psychiatrists. You can visit It each time you go see your grandparents, slowly wasting away; or when your mate finally gets out of their room, looking like they cried, to get anything for dinner. Just like the first one, it rules entire countries and we get used to It; we call It cancer, depression, AIDS, old age, broken bones and infected wounds, flu and heart attack, diabetes or schizophrenia. 

The third One lives in our hearts. We can hear It whisper to us all the time. Each moment you stuff your face or restrain yourself to look pretty. Each time someone buys another thing they don’t need, forged by a virtual slave at the other end of the world; and each moment when a tired parent avoids the Christmas-decorated streets because they can’t afford a present for their kid. It feeds the two first Ones, because what we miss, we take it by force or it weakens us. And It’s the One we’re most afraid of, to the point of throwing others to It to avoid going anywhere near It. We call it lack, impatience, hunger, thirst, addiction, growth, consumption and alcoholism. 

We call them Horsemen. 

I met the fourth One, yesterday. It welcomes us all, in the end. It weeps as we come to It screaming, weeping, or simply shattered. Few ever come to It willingly, and these ones, It cries for their past. Many beg, or bribe, or attack It. No one ever escapes It. 

As I laid dying, as the paramedics rushed to get me to a hospital, and my fiancé cried holding my hand, I met It and It was kind. It offered me words of regrets for the acts of the three others Ones. It told me It had tried to convince Them to stop hurting us, but that They never heeded Its call. So now, as It sent me back, It gave me a message to deliver unto humankind. 

It says : “Please send Them to Me. Please banish War, Famine and Pestilence from this realm. Please be better. And when you finally do, I will welcome Them in my arms and then leave. 

Theirs will be the only Death I will ever welcome without tears.”"

Jerry continued to work. He had other things to worry about, things much more important than whatever his classmates were so enamored with. 

He could hear them whispering and running over to the large row of windows overlooking the playground. Chairs scraped against the floor. It nearly broke his concentration. 

Michael was arguing with someone, though Jerry couldn’t make out what they were saying. Not over the roar. 

“What’s that?”

“Whoa!” 

“Do you think it’s a plane?”

“It can't be! It’s not even moving! How could it be a plane if—?” 

“A helicopter maybe?” 

“G-guys?”

An inhale. Like the air had been sucked into a vacuum cleaner, taking everyone’s voice along with it. Silence fell upon the classroom. 

Jerry glanced up from the worksheet. 

They were still standing before the windows, staring out. Far out. Way far out.

I entered and stood next to him, my shoulder gently touching his muscular arm. The doors closed and we started moving. Glancing at the button console and seeing the 47th floor lit up, I thought to myself, only twelve more floors to go. Then I felt his hands around my face and his tongue parting my lips. Next I felt them gripping my thighs and working up my skirt. Just as I was about to undo his belt, we halted to a stop.

""Karl, did you feel that? I think we stopped."" I laughed when I realized it was he who hit the ""emergency stop"" button. He was now undoing my bra.

All of a sudden the lights went out. We stopped, confused. In spite of the hot foreplay, this was getting a little weird.

""Do you think it's because you hit the stop button?""

Things went from a little weird to worrisome when he said he never hit the ""emergency stop"" button. I pulled away and nervously started pressing the ""call for help"" button. A voice came over the intercom:

*""Only one survives.""*

""What the fuck?! Karl, this isn't funny."" I continuously pressed the ""open doors"" button but nothing happened. Then something did.

The lights were still out but I could feel the water on my toes, rising quickly to my ankles. Before I knew it, it was up to my calves. I started to panic.

""Karl?!""

Using the lit up 47th floor button as a guide, I found the ""alarm"" button. With the water rising to my knees and my eyes still trying to adjust to the darkness, I accidentally pressed the ""call for help"" button again.

*""Only one survives.""*

""Karl! What do we do?!"" I half coughed, half said. I couldn't see it but I could tell I was breathing in something noxious.

I reached out for Karl but felt nothing. Then the fucking lights started to flicker. I didn't see Karl but I did catch a glimpse of the dense gas floating down from the ceiling vents. The lights continued to flicker.

""Karl!"" I screamed. And then I felt it.

*CRACK*

I dropped Tiffany's lifeless body and made my way to the button console. I spammed the ""call for help"" button. There was no voice this time. I kept spamming it and then all of a sudden, the lights came back on. The water started to drain. The dense gas dissipated. I removed my tie from my mouth. Coughing, I pressed the ""open doors"" button. They began to open. I was at the 47th floor. Could it be that easy?

Diary:

    You've seen it in in cartoons, the angel and demon that sits on a characters shoulders and talks. The demon is evil and the angel is good. 
    Well, I have too. Not the angel but the demon. The demon killed the angel along while ago. The demon is always there, it never leaves. It sits there and decides my every move. I can never do anything good, because the angel isn't there. Even if I try the demon stops me. 
    If I do something good it tells me its not or that I should stop doing that. It tells me to do terrible things, and I do it. Its my fault. I shouldn't have helped him kill the angel. He told me too. At the time, I think I was fine. But then it got worse.
    I stopped thinking the demon was a seperate entity, it's a part of me.
    It is me.
    I know that I shouldn't have listend too it when it told me rob that bank. I knew when it told me to shoot that poor acountant that I was doing something wrong. I sit here in an insane asylum, writing this, knowing fully well that no one will believe me when I tell them that ""the demon told me to do it"". 
    They just diagnose me with severe depression and psychopathy. I might be depressed, that might be what the demon is. But the day the demon killed the angel was the day it started to spiral.
    I hope that you dont have to experience your demon killing your angel."

Too long in fact, stretching endlessly into the distance; a pale figure staggering down on coltish legs, desperately leaning on the rough hewn wall for stability. Crumpling to the ground for the third time in as many endless moments, they let out a choked gasp, mercurial drops hitting their face, from somewhere above. 

They had been moving for moments or infinity; time was fluid here, so it was difficult to tell exactly how long, but all they had to do was reach the exit and they would be free (from the skeletal fingers and dirty claws, gaunt faces and dripping fangs). Each halting step was a step closer, to what? They could only figure that it could be better than this. 

Hopefully. Maybe. Anything would be better.

Pushing themselves up again, the floating voices that dogged their every step began to resemble mocking chants once more, almost feeling the wavering determination.

""Little child, little child, leave your will and stay awhile…""

Their shadow flickered, seeming to grow, before settling as they shook off the words once more, always a misstep from staying forever.

""Little one, little one, please come back! This is fun!""

It was a long, long hallway, and only ever seemed to grow longer with each mocking giggle that followed.







In a world far away, a large figure loomed over a small, prone body, bird like in its frailty. A chorus of humming, beeps, and whispered words made up the symphony of the room they occupied. Tears rolled down the fathers cheeks, dripping onto the gaunt and bruised face laying below, begging for forgiveness for the terror that his choice wrought, that his wife wrought. If only he knew. Humming another refrain of a lullaby he always sang to his beautiful child, he only could hope that they would come back to him."

While we were rounding the corner, a figure darted across the street. 

It was covered in a mist of darkness, so we thought it was a child going to see their friend. So, we thought nothing of it.

But while we kept walking, it noticed us, and darted back to our side.

A little worried at this point, I told my wife to go the back way, so we turned and walked the other way. But it followed.

I noticed it walking towards us, and so I told her to pick up the pace, and so we speed walked.

Then it started to speed walk.

So we started to jog.

It started jogging.

We ran.

It ran.

We started to sprint.

It sprinted in return.

We were terrified at this point, so I told my wife to go ahead and I'd deal with whatever this was.

So I turned and started to cuss it out, me being the Irishman I am.

It then walked towards me, and I was getting unnerved. 

I then grabbed a large rock from the ground, and that pissed it off enough to make it sprint full force at me.

It tackled me, and started to gnaw at my throat.

Luckily, I had the rock, so I decided to smash it's head in.

I swung the rock towards it's head...

I’m sitting in my backyard with my wife and kids looking at the moon. There is a large black scar across it, and of course the internet is a buzz with all kinds of theories. 

“IT’S THE NAZI MOON BASE”, to “IT’S A GIANT SPACE TURD.”

I’m not really sold on any theory yet, but I would be lying if I didn’t say the giant turd theory is what I’m hoping for. 

My children keep asking me, “daddy what is that!?” 

I keep having to tell them, “It’s a big old moon slug! Just looking for some food!”

They laugh and giggle and then we do the whole thing over, each time I come up with something different. A moon snake, A Moon Canyon, sometimes I like to say it’s a Moon tree that fell over. We do this mainly when we sit out by the fire pit in the back yard. We roast some hotdogs, make some smores, and just take in the night air before bedtime. 

Its been roughly 2 weeks since, what the internet is calling the ‘Poopy McMoonpoo’, came into existence. There has been no word from our government or NASA on what it truly is, however, you don’t need to work for NASA to get a nice shot of the moon. It took maybe 25 minutes before the photos were online. Incredibly detailed photos from some observatory in Denmark. The Moonpoo was actually a large crack in the moons surface. The Canyon was enormous, and after some simple measurements, it was easy to tell that the shape and circumference of the moon were distorted as well. Most people thought it was a meteor impact that damaged the moon, however, that notion was easily put to bed by the lack of space debris and NASA not detecting any meteors that could have done such damage. 

Days continue to go by and the Moonpoo continues to get larger and larger. The size is indistinguishable to the naked eye, but when measured with the telescope, the change is massively evident. Most of us had no idea there was anything wrong, I’m unsure if NASA or SpaceX thought there was something wrong. That is until the Moon, in real time, did the Pac-Man death animation. All it took was one person to notice before everyone was looking into the sky, watching the event take place. I could hear the TV describe what NASA had discovered as I watched the entire thing unfold.

“….we were wrong, it was never a moon. It was an egg.”"

Sadie watched Lisa's widening eyes as they hopped from face to face around the conference table. When they landed on her own, Sadie gave a small supportive smile. Lisa audibly exhaled, but didn't steady.

""And that,"" she was saying, ""is why this study is, uh, so necessary. To, uh, allow us to understand, exactly, what it is we don't know. Thank you.""

Our family – myself, Janie and our 8-year-old daughter, Julie – have been sick for the past week; fevers, night sweats, chills. The worst are the bad dreams; dreams in which my wife moans about lurching shapes coming for her and I have paralyzing visions of misshapen, faceless monsters with glowing red eyes. 

Janie is worried about something in our house making us sick, some post-modern malady like that shit you see on Oprah. I’m worried, too, but it’s not black mold or toxic carpets. It’s something more malevolent, something not man-made. Something elemental.

Last night, Janie cried out “it’s not a *real* wig!” in the most terrified and pitiful voice you can imagine. 

Julie woke up today, her little face shining with fever and sweat and just said “she’s swimming through the fire…she’s swimming with her wings *through the fire!*” and then collapsed back on her bed. 

Other things are happening to us as well; Janie tried to make coffee yesterday. She put meat in the filter basket and filled the reservoir with salad oil. When I tried to gently walk her back to bed, I could tell she was still caught in the throes of one of those dreams. She looked absently at me with vacant moon eyes and said “I think he might be less dead than last time.”

Today I forgot how clocks work.

I stare at the old Grandfather clock in the hallway and the face makes absolutely no sense. It’s just a jumble of lines and blurred numbers, numbers that change and move, swirl and dance.

Taking care of my wife and my daughter, all while suffering chills and aches of my own, has taken its toll on me. They’re now sleeping, more or less peacefully – no moans or screams in hours, although I have no idea what time it is – with a little chemical help from Xanax. I might take a chance on sleep myself, although I’m afraid of what horrors sleep will bring.

Lightheaded, I lay down. I feel the pillow, cool against my cheek. I doze, I drift. 

I dream. 

I dream of the faceless shapes again, the gathering terrors that loom over me as I sleep. 

I can’t move. Not a muscle. 

I can’t move anything and the shapes are getting nearer. Almost to me.

The shapes...*change*. They become filamentous, flickering, their red eyes morphing to yellow, then orange. I feel their hot breath on my face and I still can’t move. 

I see their eyes expand, cross the ceiling, grow to immense size. *Those…those are not eyes,* I think.

*Fire*. 

Fire crosses the ceiling like an army of spiders, the plaster curling and blackening. And I still can’t move, limbs frozen and useless.

I frowned again as I approached the front door and saw a pile sprawled haphazardly on my 'welcome' mat.

I picked it all up and instantly realised that it wasn't mail at all...they were photographs.

There were six pictures altogether, and all of the same room; A bathroom...*My* bathroom.

I quickly unlocked and opened the front door to stick my head out...I scanned up and down the road...

No one.

The street was as quiet and empty as it normally was, just some leaves blowing in the cold wind. I closed the door and flipped through the pictures again.

At first glance, they all looked like the same picture; A bathtub with some shampoo and other products scattered around the edge, and all taken from the same perspective. I nearly ripped them up until I noticed a small red mark on the side of the tub in one of them. It didn't take long for me to realise that the red mark was blood.

I flipped to the next photo and saw the red mark again, but this time, in a different place.

I flipped to next photo...and the next...each time, the blood mark was in a different place.

I frowned confusingly.

It must have been staring at the photographs that brought it to my attention, but suddenly, I desperately needed the toilet. 

Half-way through relieving myself, I hear the handle to my front door depress...my eyes popped open, and the sound of the winter wind grew louder, confirming my heart-pounding suspicion...

*...I'd forgotten to lock the door...*

The wind ceased as I heard the door close again.

I sat on the toilet holding my breath, my body frozen with fear...then I heard the creak of the floorboards on the second stair...the creak I'd heard so many times before, and one that I'd grown to hate. 

The bathroom door was slightly ajar and I wanted so badly to reach out and close it, but the fear was just too great.

I remained frozen, silently praying that this wasn't real, that this was all just some terrible nightmare...then, the bathroom door slowly pulled to a close...

I sat on the toilet with my legs shaking, my heart thumping, and my lungs rapidly sucking in and out tiny sips of air. I could see their shadow moving through the gap at the bottom of the door. 

**Knock...Knock...Knock.**

I stopped breathing once more.

**Knock...Knock...Knock.**

A folded piece of paper was then slid beneath the door. It glided across the floor-tiles towards me. Inside, was a rusty razor blade.

The paper read;

'It's your choice how it ends...you have 60 seconds.'

For some unknown reason, I looked down at the pictures that were still in my hand...

In each and every picture, on the side of each tub, there was a rusty razor blade.

**Knock...Knock...Knock...**"

I sat silently in the dense forest underbrush and watched the humanoid shapes pass overhead. While on the ground, I slowly retreived a rusty knife blade from my boot that I had found on the trail earlier. I wanted to flee right then but I knew that if I tried, Johnathan would beat me again. Just like he had the last two times I tried to escape. Plus we were now in the Outlands, where it’s dark, always. It’s like the sun abandoned this part of the world and if you left the protection of the light rods, the gargoyle like beasts would make a quick meal of you.
 
Myself and the other five women were being herded like cattle to Port City so that Johnathan could sell us as slaves. He had four guards posted around us with the light rods, as long as we stayed within the light we were safe. At least, from the beasts, not so much from our human captors.
 
As soon as the beasts were gone we were forced to start marching again. We were now moving uphill and following a small footpath that wound its way through the mountains. As we marched I postitioned the rusty old blade in my fingers so that I could slowly start cutting away at my bonds. Several hours passed by, my bonds were cut, I continued holding my hands in place to look like they were still tied. Just waiting for the right moment. I saw that moment as we approached a rope bridge spanning across a canyon. The bridge was narrow and we would have to travel across single file.
 
Just past the woman in front of me was a guard. In one swift motion, I leaped up and kicked the back of his knee, planted my right foot into the ground and shoved the back of his head with everything I had while also reaching over and grabbing his light rod. He tumbled over into the canyon. He was immediately lost from view but we could hear him being ripped apart. At that moment everything seemed to explode into action. The other women attacked the remaining guards and Jonathan was now charging directly at me.
 
He was big. He liked using his size and weight against opponents. But I knew this, I had suffered two of his beatings already. Just as he got close to me I feined tripping and went down on the ground, Jonathan leapt. He meant to pin me but as he came down I rolled away, leaving my rusty blade planted in the ground. He impaled himself in the chest but he wasn’t dead, I was glad. We tied him to a tree and left him for the beasts. Halfway across the bridge I turned and looked, they were eating him alive.
 
Two weeks later we arrived in Port City. And we had three human males to sell as slaves."

e6cv4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e6cv4v/detached_shadows/,Detached shadows,33,4,1575525113.0," Shadows are always around you, whether it’s day or night. Whether you’re outside or inside. They follow you and mimic you. Sometimes they appear elongated and other times they appear normal. We’ve become numb to our shadows, we don’t even acknowledge them. Science has proven that shadows are really just places where light doesn’t make it. Our bodies cover the light and so behind us it’s darker because less light is there. 

I’ve had a very different experience with shadows. Sometimes shadows are attached to their owner, sometimes they aren’t. Whenever the shadow is detached, not connected with its owner, it signifies near death. The distance between the detached shadow and the owner can also give a glimpse of how close their death is. The further the shadow, the closer the death. Here are some of the most chilling events I’ve experienced with this phenomenon. 

* I was walking around the city when I saw an old man with his shadow literally running away from him. One blink later his body is spread out across the road by a massive truck that accidentally crashed into him.
* As I was crossing the road, I saw that everyone on the street around me had their shadows drifting off, mine included. I took a few steps back and my shadow came closer until it met me again. Then I saw a person fall from the balcony of a tall building. Turns out he lands on a man on the ground killing him in the process. The people crossing the road stop obviously shocked and a bus runs over them. A whole group of people wiped out
* Another time a man was doing repairs in my home. He held his long flashlight in his mouth as he fumbled with the wires trying to fix my RGB lights. He slipped off the step ladder and landed on his face. The torch ruptured his skull and he faced an awful death

So as you can see the detached shadow doesn’t mean you can’t avoid the death it’s just a warning signal. I’ve used it countless times to prevent my own death. 

You may be wondering why I’m typing this out or why I’m telling this now. It’s because for the last few days everywhere I go. Everyone's shadows are drifting away from them. Literally every single person in every place I’ve went. I don’t think there is a next week."

I’ve been dead for years. Of course I believe in ghosts.

Even when I tell the truth the response is always, “such a joker, Gary!” Fuck you, Hank. I know your attitude is 25% gratitude, 75% cocaine.

Lying is almost better. Tell them I don’t believe in myself. Haha, me_irl. So funny, wish I could die.

No, seriously. I used to wish I were dead, but unholy fuck this is so much worse. There’s no fancy gates and halos and shitty harp music, nor is there fire, brimstone, and cold olive and pineapple pizza. Yes, that’s a thing. Yes, I’d prefer it.

The haunting thing is real, too. Sort of. After you die you’re tied to the place you obsessed over most. Not necessarily where you died. Not where you wish you died. And certainly not where you want to be.

It’s usually work. It’s almost *always* work. What, your 9 to 5 is horrible? I LIVE HERE. That’s a ghost joke. Since I’m dead. Get it? It’s not funny? Fuck you.

Afterhours isn’t so bad. I’m stuck here with others who perished long before me, though only the more recently deceased can carry a conversation. The older ghosts have long since lost their minds. Most of them don’t even speak English. Fortunately they keep to corners, staring up at nothing. Unblinking. Forever.

It gets creepy sometimes. And that’s saying something, considering I’m a ghost and all.

“But how did you die?” That’s you. I know it, because that’s all everyone who’s dead ever talks about. I’m not implying you’re dead inside, even though you probably are, it’s just that people are so obsessed with death these days. It’s always the same shit. “Heart attack.” “Car accident.” “I just woke up like this.” Okay Dan. Sure. It totally wasn’t that heroin overdose.

Death isn’t all that interesting. “I don’t believe you,” you think. You’re the same dicks who don’t believe in ghosts, but here I am, literally explaining it all. There’s no light. No choir. Just, like… a bad headache. And some scratchiness in your throat.

I guess it could be worse. Though I’m stuck at work I don’t have to do anything. Whenever I go crazy people forget about it or think I’m joking. I think that’s part of the afterlife; you can’t really affect the living world. Sure, you can try poltergeisting things, which can be amusing, but it doesn’t last long.

And yeah, I can walk through walls and become invisible. You get over it pretty quickly though. There’s something inherently gross about watching people fuck in the bathroom during lunch anyhow.

I suppose if there’s one thing I’d change, it wouldn’t even be heaven. Not nonexistence. Not even just being alive again.

I just want one person. One single person. To believe me, when I tell them."

I look through my viewfinder hoping to see the elusive silver fox with its fur that shimmered in the moonlight. Instead, I spot a man. The man had sleek, slicked back silver hair, a black suit that gave off an aura of importance. I held my breath hoping he did not spot me from the tree above. His piercing gaze turns to my direction and my heart sinks into my stomach.

 “Come on down, I won’t hurt you,” the man calls out. I jump down from the tree and try to find words for why I was in a tree at one in the morning. All that could come out was “uh..” and I look down, silent. At that moment, the man’s phone starts to ring. He pulls his phone out of his pocket and picks up. “Yes, I know.  I ran into a small issue. I’ll fix it a few minutes and we can be back on for the deal.” His tone is laced with agitation. He ends the call and turns to me, “Now, why are you here?” 

I manage to get out the words, “Silver foxes, sir.” He sighs and says, “Never heard that before, but you seem too young to get involved in my line of work. Now, off you go before I regret my decision.” This time his tone is warmer, as if he was speaking to a young child. I quickly nod my head and sprint towards my car. I hop in and speed off, wanting to get away from whatever that man was about to do. 

As soon as I get home I get out my laptop and plug in my camera’s memory card. I open up the photos I had taken of the man. Later that night, I do extensive research trying to figure out the identity of the mysterious man. However, because of my lack of evidence, I never found out who that man was. 

To this day, I do not go into those woods in fear I would run into him or the man on the other end of the phone call. I have a gut feeling I wouldn’t be let off so easy a second time."

His intuition was spot on, in no time he was in her uber on the way to her apartment. He did his best not to scratch or gasp, but he just kept feeling itchy and trapped. He must kill tonight, he thought to himself. It's never been this bad, even his throat was dusty. Getting her guard down was easy, she was fairly intoxicated. The missing furniture and down turned photos confirmed his suspicion that she was separated if not recently divorced. After a glass of wine she passed out deeply, he wouldn't even need the drugs or cuffs tonight. His heart began to pound with anticipation, it had never been this easy.

He opened the kit and removed the silver knife, it was time. Opening each of the cabinets in the kitchen he looked calmly at first with increasing hast. There must be one here. Sweating and scratching constantly he finally saw it. The knife was now shaking as he could barely contain himself. It was Trix, he would have preferred Lucky Charms but this will do. He slid the knife through the cardboard and into the packaging, being a cereal killer was intense. He thrust the knife deep into the packaging and was instantly taken off his feet with pain in his abdomen. He dropped the box in agony, laying on the floor moaning in pain. It hurt but his head felt less trapped by the claustrophobia. He looked up to see her looking down at him smirking. When she picked up the box he could see the head of a burlap doll, a voodoo doll he instantly realized. When she removed the knife his abdomen began to bleed. With the devil in her eyes she whispered ""You never asked my name... it's Mrs. Mills..."" He knew what had happened. He stammered ""Ddd"" she leaned in for his last words and he finally had the strength to get them out ""Dddamnn you General Mills....""He opened his eyes to the stunned expression of the Quaker Oats HR director... sweating profusely he realized that she was not going for his impromptu pitch in the marketing director interview... The loan sharks would surely hunt him down tonight and they wouldn't be using a voodoo doll."

Emma can rewind time and make a day restart and play out exactly the same as the first time.

Emma and I are the only one who know it.

I don’t know when Emma obtained the power to loop time but she did at some point this year.

And today it is her happiest day.

Today she turned 11 and all her friends were here.

Today she finally stood up to her bully, the one who kept stealing her stuff.

The bully who pushed her into the dumpster.

The bully who made everyday of Emma’s life hell.

But not today.

Today it was Emma’s happiest day.

Tomorrow it would be Emma’s happiest day.

Everyday will be Emma’s happiest

And tomorrow…

Tomorrow I will wake up in total blindness again.

Tomorrow I will again be unable to escape the small animal cage in the cellar she put me in.

Tomorrow I would again realise that no one would be looking for me.

And at the end of today it would all start again.

“You know what you did. Now, choose your fate!” The man yells as the audience behind them cheers loudly. The woman’s eyes scan over the hundreds of gleeful spectators, not thinking about the thousands more watching from home.

The three doors in front of her are marked with one, two, and three, the numbers painted black. She slowly steps in front of door number one as she looks back at her captor.

“You chose this life, this is your fate. The law abiding citizens of this country are patiently waiting.

“Is that your choice?” The man barks into the microphone as the audience’s cheers drowns out the woman’s thoughts. She shrugs.

“Alrighty then! She chose door number one. Producers, go ahead and press door number one. Let’s see what's waiting!” The spectators stand and scream as a man behind a large podium hits a large button as door number one swings open.

The woman gasps as a large Ogre standing ten feet tall bursts out of its cage and charges at the woman. It picks her up, squeezing its arms around her body as it bites a chuck of flesh off of her neck. Swallowing her meat, it takes another bite, devouring the woman as quickly as it can.

“What a bummer, I was really hoping we’d see the giant snake! We haven’t seen her since the first season. Well, anyway, that’s all for tonight folks! We got to see ten criminals choose their fate.

A somber silence falls over the crowd as I begin to speak.

""I regret to inform you that despite our best efforts, we have not yet identified a suspect in the Stoney Brook killer case."" I pause, taking a moment to look at the families of the victims. I can sense their feelings of loss, anger, despair and devastation. They've had their lives torn apart and I know many blame me, and truthfully they aren't wrong. I've been powerless to stop these killings.  It's almost too much for me, I have to look away to keep my composure.

""As you are all painfully aware this killer has claimed sixteen known victims in the past two years, and our best detectives are going to make sure there isn't a seventeenth."" It's a lie that I hope goes undetected. I can feel the news cameras watching me, along with their thousands of viewers. It's disquieting for a man who values privacy such as myself to be broadcast in front of all those strangers. I hope none of them judge me too harshly. I can feel my emotions rising and know I have to end this quickly before I show any cracks in my composure.

""I'd like to conclude by requesting the public give us any information they might have regarding these slayings, and to keep the victims and their families in their thoughts and prayers. I will not be answering any questions, thank you all."" Almost immediately I turn and briskly walk from the room. I sit down at my desk and process my feelings. Desire, lust, exhilaration, ecstasy.

It was fun when I was a kid, unlocking the door with the key to my diary and finding a colorful study, or putting in my house key to reveal a room that looked just like the entryway to my house. I found a skeleton key once that revealed a room caked with thick spiderwebs and skeletons dancing in colorful dresses. At first it scared me, but as I got older I learned to dance with them. 

I found my best friend when I was thirteen, the day mother gave me a decadent gold key. Unlocking the door with that key, I found a grand ballroom on the other side. She danced there in the center dressed entirely in blue, a gray boa around her neck. Princess I called her, because that was the name her beauty demanded. We danced once a month. We danced more often as I got older. 

A bronze key opened a door at seventeen that I wish I'd never seen. It was my mother, eyes closed, hair streaked with blood. The sight made my stomach turn over. Slowly, I closed the door. I couldn't erase the memory of that room from my mind. 

I tried every key I could to replace the image of the bronze key's room. They were a pleasant distraction, but they couldn't erase what I most wanted to forget. One day I was trapped in the ballroom with my best friend. She wasn't so pretty anymore. Now she acted like a princess, always telling me what to do. She wanted me to stop opening doors. She took my keys from me. 

All I have left is a pale ivory key, nearly transluscent. Ghostlike.

It’s only a fraction of a percent of the entire population, but when you put it into perspective that’s between one and two thousand people *per day*.

Like that neighbor you had a few years ago. The one with the abusive boyfriend? She probably had enough and ran off to take the next train to anywhere else. She’s definitely not rotting in a shallow grave because the drugs make it difficult for him to focus. Digging a grave can be hard work, you know.

Or that long lost second cousin once removed, or whatever the correct term is. You have some fond memories of him from when you were younger, and while no one seems to talk about him much anymore you never really did learn what happened. He always seemed a little sad, but you don’t want to think about what he may have done.

And what about that kid you got an amber alert for at three in the morning on a work day? Did they simply run off, following an animal they saw outside? Maybe play hide and seek with too-tired parents? Or did that kind older woman with the butterscotch finally succumb to her loneliness?

Many of them have been found, of course. Lost without a cellphone, drunk in an alleyway, or running from home to create a new life. Still others are discovered eventually, albeit a bit too late. The rest, of course, who knows?

That cute friend of a friend who went backpacking through Europe? Their innocence is now a selling point. The lonely kid from high school who ate in the bathroom? Holding up a cup of Kool-Aid with new friends. That work buddy who always spent long weekends up north? Not even a map and compass could get them out of *that* forest.

And yet, only recently did someone post about the correlation between missing people and America’s cave systems. Such an odd coincidence that no one really talks about. Should search parties be formed every so often? Would that only lead to more missing? And how is it that nearly every underground network is so maze-like?

Well, we designed them that way."

They lived on a large farm  in rural appalachia. Once our chores were done for the day we were allowed to roam around on the property. We could go anywhere we wanted on their property with the exception of one area; down by the southern edge of the creek there was an opening to a large cave system. Grandpa told us that we were never to go there, he never would tell us why only that we could’nt go there.
 
For the most part we obeyed. A few times we would get close enough to throw rocks at the mouth of the cave. We never saw anything except one time Jarred claimed that he saw a man with no face standing just inside the cave. We teased him about it the rest of the summer.
 
Twenty five years later and my grandparents have passed on. My father is getting older and doesn’t want to work the farm anymore so he’s entrusting it to me. The first couple months went by pretty smoothly, I was very busy repairing and fixing things around the farm. But a couple of days ago I remembered the cave and the story my cousin Jarred still swears happened. So I grabbed up my rifle and headed to the cave, just to alleviate my curiosity.
 
At first nothing was there, just an empty cave. I had turned and started to leave when I heard something, I turned back around and there in the cave stood my grandparents. Just as I remembered them, they were even wearing their favorite outfits. I was certain it was them, but, neither one of them had a face.  I tried to scream but nothing would come out. Everything went dim at that moment, I guess I blacked out. When I woke up I was deep inside the cave.
 
The cavern was lit with low smouldering torches along the walls. I found myslef in a sitting position with my hands bound behind me, water was dripping on my head. The things that resembled my faceless grandparents were standing together at the entrance of the large cavernous room. They stood very still and seemed to be staring at me, though of course, I couldn’t tell. And then I heard it. Something large was approaching from even deeper in the cave. Each foot step seemed to reverberate up through the ground. And then it was there, standing in front of me.
 
Its bottom half was like that of a goat, the top half like a human. It stood over eight feet tall and had horns coming out of its head. And it had no face.
 
It stood over me, cupping my head in its large hands and searching every inch of my face with its fingers. “Yes” it growled at me, “you will make a fine addition”."

Congratulations, you’ve most likely survived a near death experience.

You see, we don’t have a name for it, but we think it is responsible for about half of the unsolved disappearances in the world. It lurks in the shadows at night, looking for prey, but if it is seen it retreats.

We don’t exactly know why it does this, our best guess is it enjoys the thrill of the hunt and getting caught spoils the fun.

We have no idea what it exactly looks like, we just know its shape from thermal camera tests in areas with high disappearances. It appears to be the shape of a man with legs where its arms should be, crawling around on the floor. Some test subjects say it has no face, but none have been sure about its overall look.

We also have no idea what happens to its prey, a few test subjects haven’t turned around fast enough, the thermal cameras have crashed, and nothing remains, no creature and no test subject.

Eyes were windows to the soul. 

They held minute details and complexities, which he believed could never be the same as anybody else’s. Her eyes had always been his favourite, his favourite to marvel at when she first awoke, his favourite to be engrossed by each detail.

He could remember how each of the small golden flecks would shimmer ever so delicately whenever his gaze landed on hers; each small crease when she smiled; each time he would notice how the browns and greens mixed so gracefully. 

Ignorant.

Perplexed by the pure beauty he saw within her, he was nonetheless blind. Describing every unique feature or minor imperfection he saw on her face, nevertheless he was blind. He was always blind. 

Darkness surrounded him now just like it had that one night a few days ago when they had stayed up late discussing the trivialities of their lives. She had never mentioned *them*; but why should she have? It was his own ignorance that had blinded him. Still, being enveloped in this darkness made him feel safer as he could pretend there was nothing to see, pretend there was nothing to hold, pretend there was nothing to admire anymore. 

Her eyes were beautiful. They were his utmost treasure he would long to see every day; but people commit disturbing wrongdoings to steal someone’s treasure.

Yet he wanted to see her eyes again; one final time before he would shut his own forever. 

Each singular tear rolled down his cold, pale cheeks and landed with a silent thump which seemed to echo in his ears. 

Thump.

When her bleeding wrists had dropped to the floor pulling her body along.

Thump.

When his heart forced another beat to keep him alive, to taunt the consequences for his blindness.

Death had stolen his treasure.

Sharply, the surprisingly pungent smell of freshly dug soil filled his nostrils. His hands felt clammy from the cold air but also the sweat from digging. Wearily, he knelt to pause, only to be met with the familiar feeling of emptiness interwoven with his own sweat. 

He had to keep digging. 

He had to see her eyes one last time."

The luckiest folks were sitting at their desks or merely in the middle of walking somewhere. When the Vision struck us, our agonized convulsions happened relatively safely. I shudder to think of the final moments of the people driving cars, subway trains, and airplanes – the Vision, then sweet, terrifying release.

That's not to say the unbidden rush of faces and places didn't drive some to the brink of madness; the folks with their pictures posted online, the porn actors, the victims of petty revenge posts – for some, the rush was too much. I can only imagine those who yet live in that twilight of petrifying knowledge are at all times present in those moments of masturbation. I must admit I sometimes envy them, until I contemplate the totality of their situation.

Still, perhaps those trapped forever in memories of the old world are the lucky ones, for they have been spared a life in the wake of an apocalypse.

It's a funny word, ""apocalypse."" It has Greek roots which informed the connotations the Roman Church slapped onto it. Its literal meaning is ""revelation.""

So, I really can't imagine a better word to describe the day the Vision struck the world. When everybody, everywhere, all at once became aware of every single time someone had masturbated thinking about them.

You can imagine how the Vision took like a knife to the social fabric the whole world over, ripping through schools, offices, churches, families. It came like a terrible dream to sleeping and waking alike, and touched all but the most isolated human beings. Waves of riots and suicides rippled through the planet. Every urban complex, from the tiniest town to the greatest metropolis, knew its own share of bloody revenge enacted in the name of some godforsaken honor. No closet remained closed…but I am only thankful animals cannot talk.

But I've been putting off talking about it, about my Vision. I was at work, serving overpriced franchise coffee to yuppies with heavy pockets. It came on at noon. One moment I was handing a regular his half-capp soy-whip. The next, I saw my husband at home, high school ex-boyfriends alone in their rooms, strangers in bathroom stalls, regular customers.... I saw so many different times and places spanning all my post-adolescent years. I felt like I was there, in all those places watching so many sweaty hands massaging so many throbbing genitalia for days and weeks and years.

But the Vision only lasted a moment. I came to and found myself and the entire coffee shop screaming. In the brief course of the Vision, I had dropped the cup, spilling burning hot coffee all over my regular's hand. I saw his face in front of me, actually in front of me, his lip curled not in ecstasy but with the agony of pain. He cradled the blistered hand he used when he thought of me, and whimpered incoherently for cold water."

It’s still unsolved till this day.

I assume you know the basics of it, a serial killer snuck into his victim’s house and murdered them and put their bodies in a fridge.

I mean it was on the news for weeks, everyone was horrified by the fact that he cut up the people he murdered so they would fit in the fridge.

I was one of those people that had to find out how old the bodies were, which still disgusts me to this day.

Can you imagine that some of those bodies were in the fridge for over six months? That was almost impossible to deduce since they were frozen stiff.

Now that’s disgusting.

""Yes, Father,"" the deacon nods. ""Let's co-co-con-,"" he stammers, avoiding the gaze of the creature above them. Swallowing hard, he forces, ""Let's continue.""

""Very well,"" Father acknowledges. ""In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti,"" he recites, signing himself with Holy authority. Joe aims the aspergillum high and anoints Annie.

""Hang in there, sweetie!"" Mrs. Gerald sobs. ""Please God! Save my baby!""

***The consecrated liquid stings like Heaven, filling my nostrils with singed flesh. That ancient dialect pierces my ears, my screaming the only thing able to drown it out.***

""Praecipio tibi in nomine Dei discedere!"" Father commands. With rosary clutched in outstretched hand, he repeats, ""In the name of God, I command you to leave!""

***I squirm and claw at the ceiling, my fingernails digging in. I grit my teeth so hard I feel them shatter, filling my mouth with chalky blood. I twist my neck and stare back down at the cassocked man, mocking him.***

Turning away and blinking the falling plaster from his eyes, Father apologizes, ""I'm sorry Mrs. Gerald! The creature will not answer to me alone! We need to combine our strength and force him out together! Your daughter is fighting him but she can't fight him forever!""

Without hesitating, Mrs. Gerald reaches out and grabs ahold of Father's hand. ""Joe!"" she yells impatiently.

Startled, Joe signs himself nervously and grabs ahold of his other hand. ""Re-rea-ready, Father.""

With Joe and Mrs. Gerald on either side of him, Father nods reassuringly and prays, ""Benedicat nos Pater! Da nobis fortitudinem!"" The creature does not stir. ""Together!"" he implores. They repeat in unison. ""Benedicat nos Pater! Da nobis fortitudinem!""

***She tries to scream but I wrap my charred hands around her mouth. She tries to run but I envelop her in my deep, black eyes. In a last ditch effort, she tries to overpower me but I push her further down.***

Fearing their time soon expiring with no sign of the creature breaking, Father frees a hand and steps up onto the bed. Still holding on with the other hand, he reaches up with Divine strength and presses his crucifix firmly on Annie's forehead, commanding the demon out:

""REVERTERE AD INFERNUM!""

***A Blinding light...a Booming voice...a Banishing hand...I am cast out.***

Releasing Mrs. Gerald's hand, Father reaches out in time to catch the falling Annie. Her skin clammy yet body demon-free, he hands her over, relieved.

""Oh, my sweet baby!"" Mrs. Gerald sobs, clutching Annie to her chest. ""Thank you, Father,"" she weeps. He smiles. ""Of course, ma'am.""

Turning to Joe and helping him off the floor, Father apologizes, ""I'm sorry for breaking the link. She was dying.""

Joe laughs as he brushes himself off. ""Nonsense, old friend!"" he reassures. Turning fully around to face Father, he adds, ""I'm quite glad you did.""

Father freezes as he see his stark reflection in Joe's deep, black eyes, his smile completely erased.

I was 10 years old, only had a few friends do to where we lived and it was always cold as hell. If it wasn't snowing it was cold and miserable, a sunny day was hard to come by.

Due to this, I loved the snow a lot. Looking back on it, it was odd. I used to go out into the snow and just play around in it for a while. One morning while I was playing I was digging out snow, and my hand hit something. A rock? No. It didn't feel like a rock. What could it be? So I dug, and dug, and dug until I finally found what it was.

A corpse.

A rotting, decaying corpse was right in front of me. I'll never forget its distorted and inhuman face. Its eyes looked like they were made out of glass, and its bone structure almost alien like, but somehow human. I didn't stay around for long, I ran it to my parents house screaming. When they went to look, there was nothing. Just a pile of snow. Later I went to check and there was nothing there, no corpse.

After that, I didn't play outside anymore. Not for a long time. I didn't sleep much, parents told me it was just a hallucination (I'm prone to them if I don't take my meds, which I'm sure I did that day). I started seeing that corpse in everything, in the pictures, the walls, it all started to look like *it*. After my birthday though, I stopped seeing it as often, and after that I didn't think about it ever again until something happened when I was 16.

One cold summer night, long after we had moved I was having another restless night. I looked outside my window into out yard and I it. I saw *it* again, it didn't age, it didn't rot, it stared at me with its muscles contracting to smile at me. From the darkness he pulled out what looked like another corpse, but younger. He smiled at me, waving. His eye sockets were empty.

Without a second thought a grabbed a bat from my room and went outside as fast as possible, I saw it fade back into the darkness. It was gone. Vanished into thin air. I told my parents and they thought that I was off my meds even though I explained to them that I took mine last night. They still didn't believe me.

I haven't seen it since. Although I always look out the window, and sometimes I think I see something. A red, large figure fading back into the darkness."

It was blistering cold on that Christmas day in 85. I had just finished a 9-hour shift at my Uncle's restaurant (located at the mall) so I was exhausted and just wanted to go home. My parents were out of town for the Holidays so I was alone with our 2 dogs, Sasha, and Sadie.

Anyway, It was around 5:30 pm when I finally arrived home and it was already dark outside. I could hear Christmas Carolers in the distance as I let the dogs go out to pee. After they were finished I went to the kitchen to get a bite to eat.

After eating, I walked back into the living room and switched the TV to the 6:00 news.

Lately, the news was about a serial killer (whose killing spree began in November) whose victims were all females, between the ages of 18-25 and their bodies being discovered near shopping malls.

Although I was an 18-years-old female, I wasn't terribly scared.

After watching TV, I locked all the doors then laid down on the couch and instantly falling asleep, as my head hit the pillow.

I was only sleeping for 30-minutes when something jolted me out of my slumber.

Letting my eyes adjust to the dark as I scanned the living room and noticed Sasha and Sadie were growling.

I stood up and walked over to the kitchen all the while trembling. As I entered the kitchen, I felt something hit my head knocking me out cold.

When I came to, I saw a dark figure standing above me with a knife. It was too dark to make out any features but I could see they were wearing a mask. ""Stand up!"" he shouted at me.

""What do you wa-"" but before I could finish my sentence he punched me in the face causing me to stumble.

I felt my adrenaline rise as claws burst out of my hands. I screamed in pain as they tore through my skin and I started to feel warm as fur sprouted out of my body.

The man stood there frozen as I charged at him. He was screaming in pain, as I proceeded to rip off his arm and even biting chunks of his skin off. After a few minutes of this, he collapsed onto the floor where he lie there unmoving in a pool of his own blood.

Later on, the police found me passed out on the floor apparently, the alarm had gone off alerting the authorities.

The man was badly injured but still alive.

They later identified him as the 'Shopping Mall Killer'.

As they were arresting him he began shouting ""Monster!"" Eventually, the judge had him committed to a mental institution where he still resides, 34-years later.

See, when he followed me home on that fateful Christmas, he probably didn't bargain on me being a werewolf."

To push them into the floor and squeeze even harder.

To have them haphazardly grab and claw at your hand, while aimlessly thrashing around like a kid throwing a temper tantrum.

To hear them squeeze out your name with more emotion than they’ve ever had before.

To look them in the eyes as they look back at you with unshakable fear, and watch, as their last bit of anger trickles out, as their eyes roll to the back of their head.

To feel their pulse in your palm quickening and slowing down to an almost calming low drum.

To feel that body of theirs go limp, like a marionette that got all its strings cut in one snip.

To see your own fingers turn purple and wonder if the chill you’re feeling is from the hindered blood circulation or the body beneath you finally turning cold.

To feel the sense of relief and satisfaction wash over you as you catch their glazed over eyes and their sunken face void of any life.

To laugh while you pry your own hands off and reveal the beautiful splatter of dark bruising beneath, and the realisation of your own accomplishment starts to sink in.

To finally savor the feeling of crushing that filthy, pitiful life with your own two hands.

Have you ever?


Well I have. For more times than I can count.


The first time was when I saw the purple bruises he’d made on my mom’s neck, passed out in our living room floor.

Twice from the look of pity we got when people caught a glimpse of the bruises behind my mom’s collar.

Fives times when he’s broken down at the death anniversary of my biological father. Crying to him about how he’s been treating us, throwing empty promises and apologies. Pretending like he wasn’t anything less than garbage.

Thrice he’s come home drunk, calling me by my father’s name, throwing desperate confessions at my locked bedroom door.  
_

Today, I thought about it when he’d found my journal. Telling me how bad of a son I was for having such gruesome fantasies about him. Angrily flailing his arms in the air, but never putting a hand on me, because he could never hurt this face he loved so much.

All that physical and emotional pain he had inflicted on us. All the time and happiness he’d taken away. And he’s mad I thought about strangling him a few times. 

I would laugh, if not from the outrage I felt from his words.
__________
 
Thankfully, he doesn’t have to be angry for long, because I no longer plan on letting it stay a fantasy the next time.

I’m going to put an end to this, to his miserable life.

The next time I fantasize about strangling “my own father”, I plan on making it the last."

When I was little a rainy day meant board games and alighting the fireplace, listening to the steady rainfall from the sky. Raindrops have always soothed me. Laying in bed, listening to the droplets fall, it put me to sleep so easily. When I woke up, sometimes I would have the pleasure of drawing something on my window from the condensation.

There's something different tonight though. I lie here in my bedroom on the second floor. I hear the peaceful sound of rain, but it's overpowered by other sounds. Winds blowing outside, fast, shaking even the strongest trees. I hear the booming of thunder, surprising me each time, sounding so loud it seems it reverberates through my entire body. But the worst sound? I hear the crashing of waves, flowing water, crushing things on the ground level, I live almost a hundred miles inland. 

I can't look out the window. I'm afraid of what I might see.

The rain seems a little less peaceful now."

My battery is dwindling and I’m standing all alone outside of a club on the edge of town. It has closed for the night and everyone has gone home. While I wait, let me tell you what happened. 

So this club has gotten a new life in recent years as a sort of revitalized hipster dive. It was once a biker bar, almost closed down after a slew of stabbings, and was reborn under new ownership. You know the kind of place: PBR and Fireball for 5 bucks, a couple of old school arcade games, a string light on a patio, American Spirits for sale in a cigarette machine. If you got a dollar for every beard, glasses, and plaid combo you saw, you’d walk out of there with enough money to hit one of the classier joints in town.  

My friends and I decided to stay until last call. The bar staff were out of there quickly as we exited and I realized I had left my cigarettes on the back patio. I told my buddies not to wait up and I jumped the fence, grabbed the pack, and came back out to an empty parking lot. The silence was eerie. I couldn’t even hear the sounds of the city. I made my way across the lot towards the car and fished my keys out of my pocket. 

As I got closer to the vehicle, I clicked the unlock button on my key fob. The interior dome lights slowly turned on. 

*Did I see what I think I just saw?* 

*In the backseat?*

I thought I saw a shadowy figure there, but I was too far away to be sure.  I instinctively clicked the lock button. The lights went out.

About twenty yards away, I clicked the unlock button again and the dome lights slowly lit up the inside.There was no mistaking it. Someone was sitting back there. 

The silhouette was all wrong though, clearly human of some kind, but like the skull was 50% bigger than average . The head was *crooked*. The eyes were white and big, like glowing ping pong balls as the thing in my back seat smiled at me and stared. A large nose parted the veil of black wet hair that cascaded down its face. I instantly locked the door with the remote and the car went dark.

I darted back to the club, looking over my shoulder the entire way. Nothing followed. 

I was more than a little buzzed, and past experiences had led me to mistrust the police, so I decided to get home and come back during the day to get my car. Surely, this was all just my imagination.

I received an alert on my phone that my driver would be arriving. The driver had long black hair and their face was obscured in their photo. Across the parking lot, my headlights turned on."

When you’re out of ideas as a painter, sometimes the pain leaks out into something beautiful. Sometimes it leaks out of your wrists into the bathtub. It’s all just a different canvas. 

When you’re out of ideas as a writer, sometimes you can work something out of the frustration. Sometimes you can douse yourself in gasoline and light a cigarette. Ray Bradbury who? 

Most of the time, you’ll just give up though. The idea’s already been used. Yours wouldn’t have been liked as well anyway. You don’t know how to put the fear into words the way they do. It’s better to save the embarrassment of putting your work out for the world to judge, isn’t it? Fuck your passions. If it can’t be monetized, if people don’t receive it well, it’s useless. 

It’s such a shame that most of us can’t even bring ourselves to create art out of our own demise like others can. It’s a waste to even die when if one can’t do it beautifully well. Hence the cycle of suffering continues. 

This means authors will keep writing horrors, wishing their creations would gash their throats. Artists will keep drawing monsters they pray might kill them in cold blood if they make them look real enough.

The unfinished pieces are the scariest of them all.

My dad and Brody’s mom glare at me. I look over at Brody. He’s staring at the carpet. I nudge him and he looks at me, then winks. He smiles. That smile always wins me over.

My dad slams his fist on the table. It startles all of us.

“You two must cease this ‘relationship’! Did we make ourselves clear?”

I nod, tears falling from my face. Brody’s mom grabs Brody’s arm and yanks him off the couch. He turns to me to say goodbye, but he’s out the door. My dad shuts the door behind them.

Before he can lecture me further, I run to my room. I spend the evening and night crying to myself. I beat a pillow and throw objects around in pure anger. Dad doesn’t bother to check on me. I don’t sleep. I sneak out of the house in the morning.

I walk to the mall, a place where Brody and I hang out. Or hung out. We’d walk around and talk about our future and having kids.

I wander around the mall, thinking about Brody. I’m staring at the ground when a tall man in a suit steps in front of me. He wears a ridiculous top hat and oversized glasses. He’s smiling down at me from his mustached face.

“Hello young lady!”

I glare at him. He taps his chin with his finger and suddenly pulls out a bouquet of flowers from his suit sleeve.

“These are for you!”

I reluctantly take them. It’s a beautiful bouquet of lilies and roses. I smile and his smile gets bigger.

“What magic can I do for you?” He takes off his top hat and puts a hand in, waiting for me to respond.

“I want to stay with Brody and have a family!” I say, sobbing. He doesn’t stop smiling as he pulls out a black balloon from his hat. He hands it to me and strolls away.

I’m angrier than before. I throw the bouquet down. I look at the stupid balloon and grab it, squeezing it until it pops. Everything flashes black before me and I’m transported.

I’m at home, Brody is tied and gagged to a chair while my dad and his mom are tied to our table. I’m standing above them. His mother is bleeding, unconscious. My dad is staring at me in fear. I’m holding a knife, and it’s in my father’s chest.

I freak out and pull out the knife. Blood spurts out of dad's chest and I scream in shock. He looks at me with sadness in his eyes. He’s trying to say something and I lean in.

“He’s...your...brother.” He whispers to me.

I gasp in horror as I look at Brody. He has fear in his eyes. I look back at father. I wipe the tears from my eyes and yell as I bring the knife down on him again and again."

Many doubt that he was ever a man; speculating that he’s some inhuman, malevolent entity, a manifestation of Earth’s disgust at us.  

He appeared on a highway in Kansas. He was covered, drenched in some tar-like substance, which perpetually oozed from his pores. Hideous black beetles emerged as well, and all about him fat, roaring flies swarmed; as if he were some conduit of hell-spawned insects. Upon contact with any man-made surface, the slime would burn ceaselessly, until the structure was entirely destroyed, eaten away. The consuming sludge ignored the natural growths of the planet, and only pursued materials and objects forged by mankind’s hands.  

Faceless, featureless, and relentless, the sable figure strode along, leaving nothing but melted, blackened forms in his wake. He’d occasionally stop to admire something: some landscape in the distance, a great old tree, a thundering waterfall, all things of nature; never anything *built* or *constructed.*  

Eventually, the ooze which poured from him started to grow its own men. Buildings which had collapsed and melted away became massive festering cauldrons, and from these arose others, who went along on their own treks of destruction. They quickly scattered across the planet, destroying, infecting, proliferating. The seas could not stop them, the land seemed to open up and allow them passage, and no edifice of man could resist their advance. No combative force was mighty enough to hinder their assault. Bullets, bombs, and fire were equally ineffective, as were desperate cries for mercy. They were silent, inexhaustible, infernally determined.  

And thus began the Age of Worship. When violence failed to stop them, people resorted to idolatry. Masses would gather and walk alongside the Marchers—as they came to be called—praising their stoicism, even though they knew not what it was for. Some, the more zealous, would throw themselves in the secreted substance; and in their agonized screams there was always a hint, a minute suggestion of *ecstasy.* These people were often more immediately dangerous, because in anticipation of the Marcher’s arrival, they’d abduct people, tear up defenses, and dismantle structures, gathering it all in a heap to be eaten in the path of the Marchers. The military, what was left of it, gave standing orders to fire upon these cultists.  

In a week, the world of man was largely destroyed, and the Marchers, having apparently accomplished their task, began consolidating; combining with each other, until just one remained. This solitary being, as black and heinous as could be, then disintegrated—never to be seen again.  

I don’t know how many people are left. There can't be many. The remaining ooze continued to sprout diabolical insects, species never before observed, and they swarmed viciously throughout the planet. People ask what we could’ve done to deserve such violence, such terror. I think we all know, deep down, that we brought it upon ourselves. "

They sang songs in old, decrepit languages long forgotten to time. They drew a circle around her bed. Her husband was tied up by the closet. He strained against his restraints to no avail. The leader of the cult shouted in a loud voice: 

""We are Her Colony; from our ranks, she has chosen you to bear her brood!"" 

The woman was a sickly green. Her womb was throbbing rapidly. Her child was coming...even if it had to eat its way through her. The leader of the cult identified himself as Yurich, the high priest for his goddess who oversaw the inner workings of her empire. He sent one of his lackeys to the woman since she was incapable of having children of her own, so she could ingest his goddess's brood and gestate it until the time came. Now the time was at hand.

From the woman's womb crawled a purple gelatinous creature who had an innumerable range of spindly, crab-like legs. He broke through his casing with sharp appendages similar to the forearms of a praying mantis. Eyes manifested from every part of his body. He cooed in a human fashion. He bubbled to the surface before taking his first baby steps. The husband's mind melted from staring at the form of the newborn ""prince"" as he attempted to rationalize the incomprehensible form. 

The cult members took hold of the husband and shoved him in front of the indescribable creature. Yurich spoke again, this time directing his speech to his prince. He held his hands up, praising the stars above for the birth of his liege.

I’ve heard of rumors of the shadow people from friends, and I did research on documented stories of the shadow men. But what I found was very, very different. You see, we called them shadow people because we see multiple of them, varying sizes and shapes. But they’re not people, but rather only one figure, able to move and change it’s position, and shape, whenever it wants, or needs. The shadow man, hell, this thing isn’t even human. This.... shadow thing is not something you want to meet. If you see him, which almost all of you have already, don’t worry. Seeing him is different than meeting him. Meeting him to begin with is difficult. All you need to do is fill every corner of a road om as bright as possible, except for one which you will need as dark a shadow as you can get. You might not meet him, it’s very rare to.  But if you do meet him, your eyes will strain trying to see what he looks like. Trying to make out what it is, being a ever changing mass of pure black, never stopping. When he speaks, all you’ll here is pain. Searing pain will fill your ears that you can physically HEAR the sound of pain. Something that is   impossible to comprehend. The shadow man will tell you the secrets of the world, which you will then see nothing. And I don’t mean just pure black. I mean you will see nothing. This will last for what feels like infinity, but will end at some point. And when it does end, you will forget all the secrets you were just told, only knowing that he told them to you. The shadow man will then make you close your eyes, weather you want to or not, you will close your eyes. This is when he disappears. You will be right where you were when you met him. Wishing you didn’t, and no matter how hard you try, you will never forget the shadow man, and I will never forget what he told me at the end of our meeting. He told me something that let me know that he is something, almost as large as god. “I am void, I am empty, I am shadow.” And know, the shadow man is there, and the shadow man is watching.

They danced and joined, shimmered and broke apart. The rest of the room was in darkness save the moonlight streaming through the windows.

Carl knocked tentatively on the door.

After a moment, he saw two shapes – one taller than the other – step out from the shadows.

Carl smiled and tried to look non-threatening, despite the fact that he was here by invitation.  It was a natural instinct, one that made men cross the street when walking behind someone else late at night.

As the figures approached, he could make out a tall man in a tattered jacket and cowboy hat and a young boy, perhaps 13, walking in step behind him. They didn’t look like the type to own a mansion with a standalone swimhouse, but the faint alarm bells hadn’t begun to ring for Carl.

Yet.

They unbolted the door and opened it a few inches.

“You Carl – the swim guy?” the taller one said. His voice was smoke-rough and had a slight midwestern twang. *Guy* came out more like *Gah*.

“I am. I’m Carl. Nice to – uh – meet you. Though, I – uh – think there *might* have been some miscommunication. I’m sure it’s my fault, but I usually teach more – uh -*poorer*...that’s to say – uh – “ he stammered for a bit, his old stutter rearing its head under the stress.

“I d-d-d-o the free lessons f-f-for folks who usually can’t p-p-pay. You g-g-guys seem to be rather r-r-rich.”

“Oh, this ain’t *our* place, Carl, so don’t you worry ‘bout that one little bit,” he said.

“What the fuh-fuh-fuh…”  Carl shook the handcuff and strained to no avail.

“I’m thinkin’ the *miscommunication*\-“ the word came out grossly exaggerated and drawn out “ - if that’s what you’d like to call it, was on my part. See, this ain’t no swim lesson.”

“It – uh – it i-isn’t?”

“No, sir, Carl. This here’s a huntin’ lesson. For m’boy. Chester. Chester say hi to Carl.”

The boy shuffled forward, looking terrified. A large hunting knife strapped to his thigh gleamed in the moonlight.

“Pleasameetcha” he said in a low voice.

“P-p-please, sir – p-p-please l-lemme go. I just wanted to do some good for poor kids! I have a cat…” It was all he could think of.

The tall man took no notice. He tipped his hat back with a forefinger.

“Now, I tell you *whut,* Carl. *I. Tell. You. Whut*... You outrun Chester when I unlock these here handcuffs, and you c’n go on back to your cat and your poor kids n’whatnot.”

He dangled a small key on a chain in front of Carl’s face.

“But…if he catches you…”"

She was pretty, not beautiful, not stunning, but pretty, nonetheless. Her small frame was slender but curvy, and one could see that she kept herself fit. Her face, framed by orange locks, was covered in freckles and her smile was slightly off centre. Light brown eyes, almost to big for her face, staring into the distance. 

  
There was something off about them, like she was focussing on something that was not really there. It seemed to be bothering her. That look made her face tense up in a way that did not contribute to her beauty. Her hands were clasping so tightly, her knuckles turned even whiter than they had been before. The longer one looked at her, the more tainted the pretty woman became.

  
Her tension grew, her neck started twitching and her breath became flatter and louder at the same time. Her jaw was clutching and with an out breath she let out a hiss between her clenched teeth.   
Her eyes stopped looking at the undefined point in the distance and rolled up so much so, that for a second, they disappeared behind her eyelids. 

  
Her mouth flung open into a silent scream that lost its silence after a few seconds. The noise that followed was a frightening, throaty howl. Her jaw clenched again, but her lips pulled back exposing her teeth. Her eyes were open beyond what one would deem possible. 

  
No-one knew what, but something had struck her, and with her sanity, she lost her humanity."

Be it an elderly woman sharing a snack with her tired husband and exchanging an almost tearful glance of unending love, an exhausted young mother gently rocking her newborn baby to sleep whilst timidly wiping the sweat from her brow, a gang of teenagers out of school leaning tense against a wall wondering if they're going be found, or an irate businesswoman fidgeting and fixing her suit whilst tirelessly trying to make calls. I imagine their pasts and wonder at their futures as I see such a beautiful palette of interactions between fellow people. Though, as I see lips dance in idle chatter, or eyes widen at an imagined rumour, how I crave to be privy to such conversations, how I wish to indulge in such gab or gossip, how my surrounding quiet isolates me. 

   Bittersweet my silent watching truly is, because had I not decided to install the soundproofing down there then the cops surely would have heard their screams by now."

Dad was usually attentive, but when we talk about imaginary friends, he very theatrically puts his earphones in and turns away, not listening to a word you say afterward. He's always like that, since I told him about Jackie at least. Now my brother was telling him about Scratch, what did he expect? Eventually he realized he was being ignored, left the room. I went after him.

""Kate.""

Dad turned away from his phone and looked me in the eyes with a serious expression.

""This is on you.""

I nodded, and walked after my brother again.

&#x200B;

""So what's Scratch like?""

""So he's black and thin and loves to crawl around on walls with his claws, but he's real furry like a dog and he...""

I heard a tapping noise from the vents get louder and louder.

""Oh look, here he comes now! Say hi, Kate!""

Something burst out of the air vent. Like he said, it was big and furry and skinny, with long claws that I just realized were probably razor sharp. It hung on the ceiling, then dropped on my brother, which made my heart miss a beat. It dropped on his lap, though, and by the time it fell its claws were retracted. Like nothing happened, my brother started petting it.

""See, that's why I call him Scratch, he loves it when I scratch his side!""

I just realized the creature was quietly purring as it rolled around on my brother's lap. Honestly, ignoring the dangerous appearance, it was kinda cute.

""Look, he loves it so much he brings me chicken nuggets each time!""

I just realized one of the thing's claws were still a bit extended, and it was holding... chicken nuggets? Roasted meat? Something... on its claws like a fork. My brother pulled off one and ate it before I could protest, then handed me one.

""Try it, it's delicious!""

""Thanks guys, I'll save it for later. I gotta go.""

""Don't worry, Scratch has to go too. Good night Katie!""

&#x200B;

The next day, I wondered what I would tell my dad. It was a monster, but didn't seem bad or anything. Like I said, kind of cute even. I went to give my dad my report, but he was nowhere to be seen. I looked, and saw him in the backyard, hammering a metal door into our doghouse. I asked him what he was doing.

""Look"", he said giving me the community newsletter.

Two dogs on our block were killed and disemboweled in an unsolved crime.

""At least ... we're lucky ... ours is still alive"" he said while installing the door. ""What kind of ... sicko ... would do this?""

""I think I know"" I said, and didn't mention that I also knew what that ""nugget"" I put in the fridge was. He looked at me and went to the gun safe. ""You're sure?""

""He meets Scratch right before he goes to sleep. Do what you gotta do."""

For the first minute or two, I actually really liked it. I could feel the strength in my arms as I flexed to keep a firm grip on the rope and it made me feel confident and powerful.

The worst part wasn’t when my arms began to get tired. 

It wasn’t when I contemplated letting go, only to find the floor beneath me sinking farther and farther away.

It wasn’t when the rope began to thrash about, causing my shoulders to be jostled about in their sockets as the whipping gave me whiplash. 

It wasn’t when I looked down once more, to see hundreds of withered human silhouettes reaching towards me from a flaming canyon.

It wasn’t when the figures danced about my room, imposing a sense of hopeless and constantly berating me for being useless. They knew I was too afraid to just give up, so they just laughed and continued to torment my mind. But it still wasn’t the worst part.

It wasn’t when my body had become so broken from being constantly slung about the room that my arms were the only part of me I could still feel.

It wasn’t when the last bit of life left in my arms was lost and I was left to fall and succumb to the horrors I fought tooth and nail to avoid.

The worst part came shortly after I fell on my floor, the same as it was before I even noticed the rope. I looked at my hands now rubbed raw and blistered, shaking along with the rest of my cramping and weak forearms. I then took notice of the joints that had been dislocated, and the excruciating pain returning once again through every inch of my body. The pain, though, wasn’t why this was the worst part.

It was knowing all this agony could have been avoided if I had just let go as soon as it hurt."

I love her because she's fun and whimsical but anytime you stay at her house she gets all ""rules are made to be followed"" and I have to deal with getting lectured about that by a woman who once ate a bag of carrots then drank the ranch dressing that came with it. I don't get it, but hey, her house I'll do what she wants no matter how stupid.

Most of the rules I could understand like use a coaster or clean up the living space when you make a mess but some I just didn't understand. Why cant I keep my window open at night? Why do I have to shut the blinds and why shouldnt I answer the door after dark?

My aunt told me about 3 years ago when I turned 14 that she had some issues with wild animals coming into the open windows and that a 'old friend' of hers like the try and do scary things to her so she likes to play it safe. I started to understand after that.

But I figured what the harm of leaving the window cracked a few inches. It's been years since anything happened, so I doubt its going to happen after one night.

I sighed, and buried my head in my hands. I couldn't work, not like this. The music was far too loud, disjointed and distracting. I didn't know how I was ever going to meet my deadline, the piece was half-finished.

I grabbed the bottle of pills and downed a few, before dragging myself to the easel. I had spent weeks on this piece of garbage, weeks of my life down a spiral of futility. As long as this music was playing. they couldn't possibly expect me to do anything. I needed that next paycheck, because I was running dangerously low on money. I needed the pills, I needed the damn apartment, and I needed some peace and quiet.

I ran the dry brush over a section of river that I hadn't gone over yet. The piece was called, *""Memory of the Arches""*, and I did my best to reflect that in the iron red of each stroke. 

""Hey, come on now, let's do something else for a while,"" I told myself. ""Let's go out, so you don't have to listen to that music, okay? It's been-- three days since you've eaten, let's get a McMuffin or something.""

""Fuck that,"" I responded, about snapping the brush in two ""Fuck that, fuck you, fuck those shitty-ass neighbors and their constant shitty music.""

I grabbed at the canvas with my hands, tearing into it with all my might while giving out a hideous wail. Right in the middle of my latest commision was a great big tear, what an eyesore. 

""Oh no,"" I whispered. ""Oh no, oh no, oh no, look what you've done. Look what you've done.""

I went over to the window, looked down and thought of throwing myself in front of all the cars. But I didn't, opting to grab the putty knife in one hand and march to the door.

""Now you've done it,"" I screamed. ""Now you've done it you cunts, you fucking gutter-whores. Now you've done it.""

I knocked on the door, trying to reconfigure my face into a pleasant smile. But I was screaming in my mind. How dare they ruin my life. How dare they resign me to this miserable fate, rotting away in some decrepit apartment with nothing but the canvas and the music.

A man opened, the music was blaring. 

""Hey, turn down your music,"" I said, as calmly as I could. ""Turn it down. Tell your friends to stop bothering me.""

He looked confused.

""What do you mean,"" he asked. ""There's no one here and there's no music--""

I pushed him as hard as I could, slammed the door behind me, and started swinging with the putty knife and kicking and punching as hard as I could, because he wouldn't turn off the music. I swung and stabbed and kicked until what was left was satisfactory.

Because I needed to work."

Not so much. Liz never cared for nature and she was very vocal about it. But Tom didn't let her negativity ruin his vacation, nothing could soil the beauty of outdoors in his mind. 

 They set up camp in his usual spot and the morning began with a wonderful breakfast of eggs and grits. Sure, Liz burnt the scrambled over the fire but the effort made it taste better somehow. Tom funneled the remainder of the meal into his mouth and hopped up with new found energy. 

""So let's get this puppy into the water"" he said motioning to the inflated raft on the rivers edge. 

""Sounds like a good job for you"" she laughed as she continued ""i have to check the weather on my phone.""

The raft didn't take long too prepare with necessities and he was stocking a few extra beers in the cooler when he heard her gasp. While he was busy loading up she must of went to pee because she was now standing a few yards behind the tent with her eyes to the sky and hand blocking the sun. 

""Do you see it?"" She nearly whispered. 

He got up, retied the raft, and went to stand by her side. 

""What's wrong, ba--"" he stopped midsentence, seeing it for the first time. 

Beyond the silhouette of forest, in the distance, was a small sparkle. But saying it was a sparkle was like saying a puddle is the same as a ocean. It gave off a neon orange glow to the sky around it and seem to be growing slowly but surely. 

""I think I've read about these. A sun burst is what it's called."" Liz spoke in a voice that sounded unsure even to herself. 

Tom barely registered the words in his mind. The orange had now faded to a angry yellow and was slowly swallowing the clouds above it. The beams of light continued to burst out in glorious needles, penetrating any hint of bad weather. 
 
Nature had once again amazed Tom with it's might. And to think, Liz had wanted to go to a casino instead. He was about to chastise her for the very idea of missing this when he noticed her face. Below her small hand shielding her eyes, a zit like cluster began to appear. Tom's mind began to think of possible remedies to poison ivy when the blisters began to grow into what Tom recognized as first degree burns. All the while, Liz continued to stare forward at the growing light. 

*POP*

Tom jumped at least 2 feet in the air when the raft behind him exploded. The rubber wilted on the ground like a dying leaf. Then her screaming started. 

 He heard his wife's shreak somewhere in his mind but he couldn't take his eyes off of her very own. Blood poured down the cheeks he often kissed and he realised this is what it looks like when someone's eyes melt. The light continued to swallow everything in it's path behind them as Tom felt his shirt beginning to fuse to his skin. With a now blinding speed, the trees Tom so loved burst into flames as the fiery wave approach their camp. The last thoughts to cross his mind was how her screaming had finally stopped, the feeling of boiling corneas, and a shortly ended idea of a nuclear bomb dropped on American soil."

I couldn’t sleep. After hours of trying to lose consciousness, I gave up, went downstairs, and made myself a sweet tea. Just before leaving the room, I turned the lights off. The room became pitch black. I scrabbled around with my hand on the wood for a bit, trying to find the elusive handle. Annoyance turned to confusion as it continued to evade me. In anger, I reached for the light switch, so I could see my way around again but then, to my horror, I couldn’t find that either.

Fear was starting to claw its way into my brain. I dismissed it, telling myself that I was merely disorientated. I stumbled across the kitchen, reaching for my phone so that I could activate the torch. That was gone too. Everything that I needed seemed to disappear. Crawling to the front door, I hit my head on a table. Dizzy, I stood up and put my hand out to stable myself; I fell straight back down. The table had disappeared and had been replaced with air. I sobbed.

I started seeing things. Shapes flitted past the moonlit windows, just on the edge of my vision. As my eyes started to adjust to the low light, I began to see my way around. All the doorknobs and light switches had disappeared, along with most of the furniture. The room was nearly empty. *At least I can see thanks to the moon,* I thought. Then that popped out of existence too.

Instant darkness fell on the room again. I knew that I couldn’t escape.

*I wish I had my parents with me,* I whimpered dejectedly. A sudden scream came from upstairs, followed by a silence that rang in my ears like a bell had been struck. 

***FUCK***

I didn’t have a clue what was happening, but I knew that whatever was doing this had just killed my parents. 

I picked up a heavy piece of driftwood to throw at one of the windows so I could escape, but the branch disappeared the moment before it left my hands, sending me tumbling forwards because of the lost momentum. I punched the window with all of my might, but my fist only struck concrete, shattering my hand.   *I need to just curl up in the corner. There’s nothing else to do.* I whispered. I backed up in terror and lay down.

and

then

fell 

There was no corner. Only the void. I could have been falling, or standing still to be honest. It was so dark that it didn’t make a difference. 

I was the only thing left. Nothing else existed.

Wait…

There was something else.

I could feel something coming closer, and I knew that there was only it and me. No one to save me. No one to care.

Its eyes glowed; two points of blinding red light in the blinding darkness.

After that I left the room. Upon exiting out the door, I heard bells jingling. I looked above the door to see bells attached to it. Probably just a Christmas decoration. I later arrived home. That's when I got a call that my friends had mysterious died in the locker room. Not that I care, but it certainty is odd how they just died for no reason.

The next day, I woke up, and walked out of my room for breakfast. Upon exiting out the room, I heard bells jingling. I looked above my door to see bells attached to it. I wonder who put those there? Anyway, I had scrambled eggs and orange juice for breakfast. I was about to head out the door, until I forgot that I left something in my room. I entered my room, and it was completely destroyed. Everything looked unrecognizable. How did this happen!? I ran out of the room, and that's when I noticed that the bells were no longer attached door. I ran out of the house. *ding ding ding ding*. Uh oh. I looked behind me, and saw those dreaded bells having from on top the front door. I slowly backed away in to the streets. That's when I got hit by a car.

I opened my eyes. I was laying in a hospital bed. My arm and leg was broken, and they put a cast over my head. Ironically, ""Jingle Bells"" was playing on the overhead speakers. Huh. I looked around, and saw that there was a doctor next to me. He told me I may have to be here for a few weeks. Ugh... those dammed bells. As soon as he left the room, I could have sworn I heard those dreaded bells. Maybe I'm just hearing things. I then closed my eyes. But I never woke up...

... Until 20 years later. I look around. The hospital room was completely vacant. But it was still playing ""Jingle Bells"" for some reason. I tried standing out of the hospital bed, but I just ended up collapsing to the floor. I crawled to the big window. It looked so lifeless outside. I pushed it back, and the bells jingled. I fell off the window seal, and landed on the ground. I broke all the fragile bones in my body. I couldn't move at all. I was completely paralyzed laying on my stomach. Snow then began falling down heavily.

Merry Christmas."

I know, lucky right? It was the best. I could observe his paintings at almost any art show. The bold brushstrokes and dynamic forms take my breath away to this day. I would spend all my paycheck week after week on his art. I'd go days without food. But no matter how I saved or scrounged,  I couldn't collect all of his works.

Especially in the north and central areas. Most say it's way too early for snow, but I enjoy the snowy weather. What I didn't enjoy was the power outages. 

It began around noon today. The storm rolled in. At 1:00 the power went out. Maybe I should've stayed at Mom's house for one more day. She hated it when I left as soon as dinner ended. 

It was an hour later when I heard a knock on my door.   I was reluctant to open the door at first. Who in their right mind would come to my house in the middle of a storm? I looked out the window and I saw something that made my heart stop. It was a child. They were wearing a pink coat, but they were barefoot. I opened the door.

""Help me! He's coming! Close the door!"" I did what she said.

""What is happening?"" I asked. 

""He's coming for me. I wasn't bad! But he still wants me!""

""Who are you talking about?"" I asked, now I was seriously worried for this little girl.

""Krampus.""

""Who?""

""I don't want to say his name anymore. It attracts him I think.""

""Okay"" I responded. I didn't believe her. There was no Krampus, but there was people that were just as bad as him. Her imagination must've gotten the best of her, and she saw her abusive father or something as a deamon. ""Let me light a fire in the fireplace and I'll get you some cocca."" I said. My plan was to make the fire, and then call the police. I went to open the fireplace. I began to put wood inside the fireplace. I then lit the fire.

This was the worst mistake of my life.

No fire started, but in it's place, were footsteps. They were coming from the ceiling.

Suddenly something dropped from the chimney. A sack. Then a pair of hairy, hooved legs.  Out stepped a tall human goat hybrid, wearing a cloack and welding a sack.

""Im a good girl, I'm a good girl!"" The girl pleaded. It didn't work. The monster smiled, and then picked her up and threw her into his sack. Her screames sounded like she was falling. After the screaming ended, he looked at me.

""Why. Why her? Why now?"" I asked, Still in shock.

It shrugged. "" I decided that Christmas should come early this year.""

Then it disappeared. As soon as it arrived. It disappeared along with the girl. 

If you are reading this and you have children, I warn you, protect them. This thing, Krampus is coming for them. Don't let them near a fireplace or chimney. And prey. Prey that they were good this year."

Orcs were never beautiful creatures, but this one, in particular, was especially vile. His features were indescribable. As a child, his tusks were pulled out, and his face was distorted, leaving it Gargoylian and sneering. The mask he wore never came off.

One morning, he went to the marketplace. Every one of his steps left a greasy spot on the cold, smooth cobblestones. His head was down. It was like a rain cloud shadowed him everywhere he went. 

He just needed to get some food, otherwise he’d die. Cowards are afraid of death. But he was still afraid of people.

The Orc walked up to the vendor. “I’ll have 3 of each.” He pointed to carrots, cabbages, and tomatoes. The transaction was painless.

“Have a nice morning,” said the vendor. The vendor was better than him as a person, the Orc thought. 

“You, too.” He slinked off, back to his hole. The vendor wiped the grease off of the coins.

He literally lived in a hole, with sticks pushed in the ground as walls. The hole was dug up with a strong stick many moons ago, and he lived in it. That was the extent of his life skills, digging holes with a stick. Financially, he survived off of an inheritance. And it was a dwindling inheritance. 

The Orc got up and set off for his daily walk. He had gone on this walk so many times, the grass had all withered. 

But there was nothing else for him to do. The path was a loop, so when he finished, he was back in the hole. It was maddening, every day was the same. He squeezed his skull and rolled around in the dirt, wanting to yell out, but fearing he might be heard. After the crisis, there was nothing else to do, so he went along the trail again. 

“Is this all there is to life? What is the point? What is this?”

“I am unwhole. My tusks were taken from me as a child. I am an abomination.”

“Somebody help me.”

“Somebody kill me.”"

But after he died, I decided to go to his funeral. 

&#x200B;

I arrived at my father's house for the service. It looked rundown and smelled strongly of peanuts. 

I was let in by three pale, thin men. They looked aged between forty (like me) and seventy.

To my amazement, they introduced themselves as:

""Joseph.""

""Joseph."" 

""And... Joseph.""

Apparently they were the long-lost half-brothers I never knew about.

""Finally reunited! Welcome home, brother,"" said the eldest. He clapped me on the back with his uncomfortably bony hand.

&#x200B;

It was only the four of us, so we simply gathered in the living room. We sat on plain, hard, wooden chairs around a coffee table, which held several bowls of peanut-related snacks. At the head of the table was a huge, ancient and empty armchair. 

They began to reminisce and to put it plainly, any regrets I had for never meeting my father were obliterated. Apparently abandonment was my Dad's MO. His life's work was conceiving children and then moving on to do it again. Except, unlike me, he had drifted in and out of my brothers' lives over the years, so they got to experience his controlling, brutal and cruel personality. 

I squirmed in my seat. However, my newfound brothers, did not share my reticence and spoke only with rapturous love and respect towards the man, who had repeatedly abused and abandoned them over the years. 

""Enough,"" I eventually said.

They stared at me. I stood up.

""I have to go."" I was shaking. Vindictive words bubbled in me, but so did the urge to just leave. 

""Joseph, please,"" said the youngest. ""I know what you're thinking. But do not judge our father harshly. All his life, he only wanted what all great men want.""

""Yeah? What's that?""

""Isn't it obvious? A heir, Joseph. All Daddy ever wanted was a son worthy of his name. But none of us were worthy - ""

I laughed harshly. ""Not worthy enough? For who? The lying scumbag who treated his families like trash?""

""We are trash,"" he calmly repeated. ""But don't you see? That's why we're so glad you came today.""

""What?"" My chest constricted.

""You can help him, Joseph. You can help Daddy attain the heir he's always desired.""

I stared at him. ""Help him? Are you mad? He's dead!""

""No, brother - ""

Overwhelmed, I picked up a bowl of peanut clusters and hurled it at the armchair. Then I ran to the door. My heart thudded. I expected them to try and stop me, but when I looked back, they had congregated at the doorway. As if afraid to go outside.

&#x200B;

That night, back home, I crept into my daughter, Sally's, room, eager to see her. 

I smelled it before I saw it. A packet of peanut brittle by her bed. In disbelief, I picked it up and read the handwriting scrawled on it.

*For Josephine.*"

I slumped over, defeated, but my father’s excited tone made me perk back up.

“Oh? What’s this?” He said while reaching behind his back. He then pulled out a neat square package, tied neatly with a paper bow.

“YAY! Oh daddy, thank you, thank you, thank you!”

As I tore the paper off of the box, my dad smiled warmly. “I got it from the cashier. I’m sure he was happy to help make my little buddy’s early Christmas great. I’ve just gotta warn you, darling, I stepped on it while trying to pick it up, so it may be a little squished.”

I finally pulled my present out. Daddy wasn’t kidding when he said he squished it.

“Aw, Daddy...”

“What’s the matter, sweetheart?”

I turned the gift to show him.

I could feel something moving under the bed, I felt it was something big, it can't be a rat... I move my head slowly to look down on the floor between the space of my soles and in a second I regretted, there stood still a pair of slender arms so white that I could get blind, hands so feminine and young-looking but I remain horrified as I see her purple nails suddenly scratching on the floor in dark-red letters 5 words that gives me a feeling of pure terror: they are coming for you. 
My breath stops as I see how easily they're gone like how chalk is wiped off the blackboard, not a single sign will lead to their existence, i thought that it will be over, she will leave now, but what a stupid mistake I made. While I was trying not to lose my mind, her head appeared from under the bed so slowly that I felt a shock so intense that I could not react, I just watched her face shown to be on the verge of dieing , I saw her profile , she stood still, I couldn't tell if she was breathing or not, I don't even know how long I've been looking at her, her hair was so twisted and her face was wrinkled, and in my dreadful horror I made a single move that caused a tiny sound, I swallowed hard, while she begins to turn her gaze at me while an impossible large smile reveals her sharp filthy blood teeth, I was starting to have a panic attack at this point and warm tears run down my face as I see her beautiful light-green eyes being replaced with just two dark holes of the missing orbs, there was no reflection in them and I could feel how my body began to get so cold, I could hear myself trembling on the bed as she throw a painful laugh at me meanwhile almost noticing her tiny tears,I couldn't tell if it was her own or my falling ones on her bruised cheek.

It's always been my favorite color after all. It only seemed fitting because of my size. It's neutral, goes with everything,doesn't make a girl like myself stand out, and the best part. It's slimming. The darkness of the fabric instills in me the smallest of confidence knowing that no one will stare. Not for too long, anyway. I let the color envelope me, like a warm safety blanket. I always want to try yellow, purple, even pink garments, anything bright and bold. If I can just lose some of the weight I would be comfortable in cute stuff like that. But food, food is just so good that I can't stop myself from the guilty pleasure of all things junk food. All the other girls make it look so easy, so effortless. It's okay, I don't like being the center of attention. But he knew that. He knew that I would undoubtedly be  wearing all *black*. He knew no one notice me, or look twice when I left the burger shak at midnight with my usual #6. When I passed the lamps in the parking lot he knew no one would see him force me into his *black* car. All those days I longed for someone to notice me, he did."

I could barely keep my eyes open. In the corner of my eyes I saw a dark figure shuffling towards the front door of the house. The lights on the outside had blown out earlier that day, obscuring the figure in darkness.

It looked like a man was trying to break into my house. I was panicking. My older son, daughter, and wife were inside, possibly sleeping. The man pulled out a jingling object, bouncing it around in his hand. The darkness made him juggle the object in his hands, confounding him. 

If I didn't act fast, the assailant could break into my house and assault my family. I absentmindedly grabbed a rock with my right hand. Motioning it in close proximity to the criminal, I tossed the rock. It collided with him head on. I heard a small crunch and he fell. 

I ran forward to strike him again with the rock until I ensured he wasn't moving. My wife slammed the door open holding a flashlight in her hand. She let out a scream driving me to look down. I too was in a shock.

I was told, so many years ago, to never go downstairs.

""It's a scary place for a young girl like you."" 
Mother always reminded me of that. And so, I spent my days playing in my room, alone, undisturbed and untouched like a precious flower in a field of grass. I was never to leave that field.

Whenever mother left the house for a couple of hours, I would amuse myself with the various toys I had at my disposal, like my tea set, or my dollhouse. And when she would return, she would set down her things and say, ""It's okay darling, mommy is here,"" and I would run to her and give her a big hug. That was my normal.

But today wasn't normal.  Mother did not leave like she usually did. She was reclusive and distant, and she spent most of the day in the basement. I asked her what she was doing. But she didn't answer me. She just shuffled silently to her bedroom and shut the door. I was intrigued.

That night, as I counted sheep (a trivial attempt at falling asleep) my childish fantasies of unicorns, cotton candy, and talking barbie dolls were interrupted by a small, seemingly unnoticeable thud. 

*I'm almost certain it came from the basement* 

Disregarding my mother's warning to never go there, I quietly snuck out from my room, to the first floor, and to the top of the basement stairs. I was a big girl after all, and big girls were brave. So, without fear, I took my first step down, but each step after that made safety seem further and further away. 

Then I reached the bottom.

There was a door blocking my entrance into the main part of the basement. It felt old and dirty, and the knob was covered in rust. It was hard work, but I managed to pry the door open just enough to fit my body through. The room was pitch black, and I decided it was best to search for a light switch so I could see what was in here. I fumbled around in the dark when my fingers contacted with something cold, and soft. A dirty hand grasped me around the mouth. I tried to kick and scream and holler, but my efforts proved unsuccessful. Tears formed in my eyes, and I wanted my mother to hold me and tell me everything was going to be alright. That was when I heard the sound of footsteps slowly descending into the basement. All I could do was gaze into the light coming from the half-open basement door; I was helpless. I soon saw a slender silhouette peeking from behind its ambiguous frame. In their hand, a shiny metallic object pierced through the midnight darkness. I let out a strangled scream.

""It's okay darling, mommy is here."""

At first my brother tried to protest my unfair situation, but they refused to listen, so he eventually relented and we accepted my fate. My life had been ruined by those monsters,I had no friends, no hobbies, nothing but this godforsaken basement. I wasn't even given heating or air conditioning for when the weather got cold or hot. I've received very minimal sun these last 10 years so my skin has gone very pale. The only things they ""do"" for me is give me good, water, and will occasionally give me a haircut or shave so my appearance is as pleasant as possible.

I sit here, as I seemingly always have, waiting for my son to visit and perhaps give me some food. He is a good boy, if not always as caring as I would hope him to be. He bought me this chair after all. This chair is everything to me, when he bought it I knew that I would have it for the rest of my life. It was just so comfortable. When he sold all the other furniture I didn’t really mind, I had my chair. Those were the good days though, back when the house was warm and the pets were still alive. Back when I could move. My first accident in the chair was very embarrassing, I woke up in a daze and realised I had wet myself but it wasn’t just piss. The piss and shit had sunk into the chair and I felt immediately compelled to move, to clean myself, to wrest this shame from the memory of the universe and cleanse it entirely. I didn’t want anyone to know, no one could know how filthy I was. 

*The boy was filthy once too, I cleansed him of all his filthy habits one by one as they arose like pus-filled boils on the once innocent face of the babe I bore. Each hideous sin had to be lanced and purified and that purification left a scar; a perfect memory of what he should not be.* 

It shouldn’t’ve been surprising that my angel returned to me at that moment, my beautiful boy, scourged and rinsed. He didn’t need to say a single word, he sniffed and retched at what a worthless and pathetic specimen I had become. He knew what needed to be done, I had taught him well. I was to sit in my filth until I learned my lesson, to merge with the shit and the snot and the piss and repent my sin. Only then could I be reborn. Only when I refused to render my will to this aching, wretched flesh, could I be rewarded with his love.  

I am old now, though. Age has rendered my body weak and incapable. I try and fight the urge, try and stop myself from sinning but the filth spurts from me like a neverending spout of evil that must’ve been brewing up inside my bowels my entire life. It stinks and coats every crevice. It leaks onto the floor and pools about my toes. I beg my son to stop feeding me but he continues, sometimes forcing tubes down my throat and pouring pulverised meats down my gullet. He makes me thank him.

It has been months now; the house has grown as horrid as my rotten, sallow flesh. I have sat in this every growing mound of disgusting, mouldy, shit as it dissolved my beloved chair. I have felt my skin crack and heal and grow around this horrid thing. I can never leave now, I can never truly repent. I am to sit here, always. Rotting but never dying."

I can feel how awful my starved lungs consume the oxygen, it gets heavy inside me, meanwhile a headache makes me dizzy but still let me observe the situation I am in, nowhere to go or no idea of how to get back home... warning signs in my head hurts and I almost drown in them but a new thought hit my brain... what if I won't run away, what's going to happen? and anyway, why I want to run?

I had a dream where the naked pink turkey-bits grew stubby little bones that flapped and slid against the slimy lining of my insides. I had a dream where the bottle of whiskey, the bitter red wine, and the three-four-five cups of disgusting lukewarm beer crept sluggishly through my bloodstream, making my head pound and my breathing grow shallow.

I bolted up screaming and there it was, looming over Martha’s bed that she or maybe Jeff had bothered to tuck me into, staring down at me with cavernous eye-holes dripping yellow lard. Its third pair of spindly bony legs wriggling their way out the fatty slit running down my potbelly. Flapping its slimy webbed appendages. It had a beak like some demented bird but its body was black and stinking with bile. When it opened up its throat, its cry was the garbled cheers of Martha and Jeff and the goddamned lunatic Homer downstairs in the living room, followed by the muffled shouting of some painfully loud idiot giving the play-by-play.

I stared at the creature through my drunken haze and swallowed the sting of vomit at the back of my throat. With a warm squelching sound, it pulled the rest of its body from mine and skittered off the bed, giggling. I sat petrified as its slime-covered footfalls disappeared down the hallway toward Tammie’s room. Then I stumbled to my feet, pouring my guts out onto the floor, and ran down the slick wet floorboards after the thing.

The hallway was half a mile long and twisted up like I had never seen before. When I finally got to Tammie’s room, it was there. In her bed. My sweet little three-year-old was gone, replaced by the spindly bony creature that smacked its beak. At my appearance, it began to squeal. Calling me Daddy in a little girl’s voice.

I barreled up to the bed and drove my fist into the creature’s stomach. It screamed and started sobbing. I punched it again, hard. Again. And again.

“Mommy,” it sobbed. “Mommy!”

Footsteps scrambled up the stairs as I staggered back and vomited up the whiskey-wine-beer slurry from deep inside my stomach. A few of the little white pills were still floating in it, only partially dissolved. Homer had told me with his disgusting knowing sneer that they would make the evening go by faster. That he used them whenever he had to deal with his mother-in-law.

But as Jeff pried me away from the bruised and battered body of my daughter and Martha began to sob, I remembered why Homer had been thrown into jail those couple of years ago, and why I dreaded family gatherings every time they came around."

The car ride so far has been a perpetual awkward silence and it's not likely to break. We have been dreading this day all year, but we have to go.

Every year is the same thing. Our Aunt Bertha gives us excessively wet kisses and asks if we're passing all of our classes in school. Uncle Ben inevitably gets too drunk and makes a pass at all his sisters-in-law. And when the dinner is done, which is hardly palatable every year, we get out the Christmas decorations and argue about how to set up the tree.

But all of those reason are not why my family is not happy about going this year. We usually get by with our snide remarks and knowing glances at each other. Some of our cousins even get in on it. But this year is different. 

Last year, Thanksgiving went to hell. No one really knows who to blame, but we all agreed to keep it amongst ourselves. What we decided actually happened (or what we would tell others should they find out) was that Grandma got ahold if the carving knife herself. Senile as she is, it somehow ended up in her chest. No one was seen doing it, but everyone had motive. Every sibling has a reason why they would want grandma dead.

So that is why this year is going to be especially difficult. We have to face the same family we know killed our grandma last year. But nothing prepared us for what we saw when we walked in.

Grandma was still sitting in her chair. It looked like she hadn't been moved since last Thanksgiving. The knife was still sticking out of her chest.

Here comes Aunt Bertha. I guess it's time to put on my happy face."

Came home after that and had a great day with my mom and my cat and her husband. It was all fun and games till I went home downstairs to my apartment. 
So a little background. I moved into this house almost exactly a year ago (12/2/18) with my mom and her husband. Had a fling with the landlord (who’s 31) and broke it off, then back on. We’ve been dating officially for almost 3 months now. When I first moved in he told me about the guy who killed him self in our basement by hanging. I was all excited because i love ghost and spooky shit. Then he told me about the body fluid outline in my apartment (mind you he owns a two family home and originally I lived upstairs). I’ve seen it and thought it was cool. 
Fast forward to today......
I come home from work and I go upstairs because my bf went to another state to see his family, I worked. So I go upstairs and have a good dinner with my mom and her husband. I go downstairs and I sit down
 I turn the tv on and I hear it..... 
the dryer is going.
I stop before I play my video on YouTube.
“Squeak, squeak squeak”.   
Brahhh 
I just walked through the downstairs to come to my apartment to play music. I call my bf and tell him and in the process of telling him, it stopped. 
He contributed it to us watching to much ghost stories before bed. I say someone was calling me to the basement. 
The other day I was downstairs doing our laundry, and something touched my head. I’ve only been doing laundry down there since August 2019."

He’s been quiet for a bit (can’t blame him, the Falcons are losing) but we still sat there. Mike in his Falcons jersey, Tom in his gold, me in my black.

I think at this point we were just watching it out of stubbornness. Kate and Mike had a huge fight because she wanted to see her parents and he wanted to “Watch that crappy team.”

So Kate stormed out, taking the car and leaving us with Mike. Him slouched on the only chair, Tom and me on the floor pretending to follow the game. 

Kate must have taken the food with her because we can’t find the turkey. Mike had been snacking on a wing earlier but refused to share, even after we begged. We haven’t eaten since Kate fed us breakfast, and we would have killed for some turkey.

Mike’s phone has been ringing for a bit, but we couldn’t reach it. The game ended and Mike didn’t move. The TV kept playing, telling us about Black Friday deals. At this point all we wanted was to get some food. 

I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew it was morning. I heard Tom chomping on something, so maybe he found the turkey after all!

I ran toward Tom, my tail wagging, and couldn’t believe my eyes. Tom was chewing on some thigh, but it wasn’t turkey. 

By the time Kate came back on Saturday, Tom’s gold coat was stained with red streaks and my black coat wasn’t doing much better. 

Kate’s screams were only drowned out by the sirens from the EMTs.

“I’ve never seen retrievers do this, ma’am. Looks like your husband choked on a turkey bone. I’m sorry for your loss.”

Hopefully next year we get to the meat before it’s cold."

They all sit next to the window and its like the chair closest to the window are for people who are most likely to leave and for new people to replace them. Every day 1 guy leaves and another man replaces him. Its always a male and that is a bad staff turnover rate. 

One day after the end of a work day, I saw a new guy sitting at the chair next to the window. I had a feeling he wasn't going to come back and I wanted to talk with him. I followed him down an alley way and then he suddenly shape shifted to look like a different guy.

While my parents were sleeping, I sneaked out of my room, heading straight to the condominium's rooftop. 

That's where I jumped off. It's a 14-story building. You get the picture, right? 

I felt the wind, just for a second, then I felt nothing.

Soon I was woken up by the sound of people walking around, mostly the police and those investigating the scene. I also heard cryings from a distance.

It must've been the next morning, and I was lying on the ground. 

At that moment, all I felt was numbness. There was blood coming from my mouth, but I could do nothing about it. In fact, I couldn't move any of my limbs. I couldn't even blink.

With both my eyes wide open, it felt as if I was forced to experience what was going to happen next.

I saw my mom running toward me, and when she got too close, those policemen rushed to her and held her in place. My dad soon followed. Both of them ended up on their knees, cuddling, while I listened to the screams my mom produced.

At least I was still alive, I thought.

I was wrong, and I learned it the hard way.

They soon covered me with a large white piece of fabric.

They brought me to the autopsy room.

They declared the date and time I was dead.

They cut open my body and took the organs out one by one.

What they've done to me, I saw it all. I heard it all, but I just couldn't move or feel anything. 

I was stuck in my own body.

However, that wasn't the worst part. 

After they finished my autopsy, they closed my eyes and everything went black.

Then I woke up in my bed. The clock read 1.43 AM. I soon realized that I had no control over my body at all. I got up, walked out of my room, went up the stairs, all the way to the rooftop.

It wasn't me.

I tried to resist, but nothing happened. This spirit was just the 'observer'. I could only watch. 

I was forced to watch.

My body stood at the edge for a while. But deep within, I screamed and screamed and screamed, regret what I had done and what I was about to do.

For the first time, I wanted to live.

But no one listened.

I let my body fell. Gravity did its job. I felt the wind, just for a second, then I felt nothing.

And it all started again.

The numbness.

The sound of people walking around.

The sound of my mom screaming like crazy.

The image of my own autopsy.

The image of my own suicide.

The regret.

I went through all of this.

Again

And again

He looked handsome, moreso beautiful. He was different from all the people I have seen before. Not that I have a lot of friends- I am the least social person you will ever meet. But he was different. You will know when you look at him.

Only you won't be able to see him. You wouldn't even know his existence. You wouldn't even know if he walks past you.
And you will see him only twice in your life. One- when you are born but you are too young to remember. Two- one when you are dying but too scared to remember.

I don't know why I can see him. I don't know what changed on my life on the day i first saw him. And i knew instantly that he was different.
Maybe I should have taken the cue. Maybe if i had paid attention this day would have never come. Maybe if i knew I would have tried to live my life differently.

I can never be credited for being a good person.I just couldn't be not selfish at any given point of time. And that is exactly why I don't understand why I stepped in to push the child away from the oncoming truck. If the child was hit ,it would all have been his mother's fault for not looking after him. Her fault for ignoring the child to gossip with a woman. I still don't understand why my legs started moving before my brain could summarize the situation.

They say before you die,your life will flash in front of your eyes. Mine didn't. The only thing flashing in front of my eyes is his smile. The slight smile on the curve of his lips did not exhibit satisfaction,it was more of a sad smile. A smile of pity. And when I hit the road headfirst after getting thrown into the air, i did not feel any pain but a sudden realization flashed in front of my eyes.

Realization of who he was, what he does.
You will meet him twice in your life. Once to give you something and next to take it back from you and give it to another person. I don't know how many people have known him before and how many will see him after me.

People generally called him grim reaper, death or any such term for death. You will too if you see him when you are old enough to remember.And you will easily mistake him for death itself. But the moment my head hit the road,I realized his name.  He laid next to me on the road. The sad smile transferred from his lips to mine.

 I have finally recognised him- whom people call Fate."

She used to have a family, two sons and a husband who loved her dearly, but they have all but abandoned her. This is the fifth year in a row where she has had to spend the holidays alone. You’d think she’d be used to it, but as she wipes the tears from her cheeks and downs the remaining red wine, she knows she’s not completely over it.

It was Thanksgiving 2014 when her life came crashing down. Her husband had been caught fucking her son’s teacher, and despite the pleas for forgiveness, he didn’t really want it. He just wanted to put on the façade of guilt so that he could come up with a game plan to leave her.

She caught onto his ruse by logging into his social media and reading the messages between him and his lover. They called her a ‘witch’, ‘whore’, and an ‘old hag.’ She spent a few days wallowing in self-pity before she decided to ruin his life.

She told his colleges that he was unfaithful, spread his business all over social media, and made up some lies so that his parents would kick him out of the family. She thought that she’d for sure win custody of the boys, but after a drunken bender when she attacked her husband with a broken wine bottle, he won custody due to her violent tendencies. That was the last time she ever saw her boys.

The woman stands up and puts the fire out, walking around to lock up her house. When she got to her front door, it was cracked open. Weird, she thought, as she hasn’t left the house all evening. She closes the door and locks it, turning around and staring at the entry-way. 

She hears a slight humming coming from upstairs. Making her way to the second floor, the stairs don’t creak beneath her feet. She notices bedroom door is wide open as a monster stands in front of the mirror. Humming loudly, his body is hunched over and drooling on her dresser. He sees her walk in and smiles at her.

“You know why I’m here,” the thing whispers as it turns around and stares at her. It’s eyes the deepest shade of black and it’s skin a deep purple.

“I do,” the woman quivers, taking a step forward. The monster lunges at her, ripping her throat out. Her blood drenches the room, staining the white comforter a deep shade of red. The monster takes her head with it as it slinks out of the house, glad that it was called upon to end her loneliness as it needed a good holiday meal."

I was so wrapped up in my confusion, I didn't even notice her there, but when I finally did see her, I wished I hadn’t. She was naked, with a vaguely female body. However, there seemed to be something crawling under her skin, like she was filled with bugs that were trying to escape. I did not dare to look up at her face, afraid of what I would find. Now that she had my attention, she whispered a single phrase, which sounded as if it came from inside my own head:

“Should my eyes you look inside,
You’ll see yourself once you have died”

Myself once I have died? The prospect of seeing what my dead body will look like was horrifying, yet intriguing. What if I could use this to somehow prevent my own death? Yet, what if I discover I die horribly, and live the rest of my life in fear of that? Perhaps I will be completely charred, with burns oozing all over my skin. Perhaps I will have drowned, and my body will be wet and bloated. Maybe it will be nice, and I will see myself as elderly, having died peacefully surrounded by loved ones. This curiosity was too much to bare. I looked up, into her eyes.

Interested, you walk up to the man. You dig into your pockets for some change and hand over the quarter.

The man smiles.

""I see . . ."" he says, closing his eyes, ""a dark future.""

You don't like hearing that.

""But,"" he continues, ""I see a golden bed, just for you!""

Confused, you ask what he means, but the man turns and walks away. Waste of a quarter, you think.

In the diner, though, your day takes a little turn. As you wait for your burger and fries, you spot a scribbled piece of paper stuck between the ketchup and mustard. You take it.

Want to become rich fast? Call me at the following number...

Expecting a prank call of some sort, you dial the number and hear a woman's Hello. You tell her it's about becoming rich. She says to wait outside the diner, wait for a green car to drive by. She hangs up.

You chuckle to yourself and eat your burger. It's greasy heaven. Juices everywhere. Fries, salty, on point. You're washing it down with lemonade when you glance out the window and see the green car parked with the windows down. Two old ladies are gesturing you over.

Not expecting old ladies to be prank callers, you pay the bill and head outside. The old lady in the passenger's seat asks your name, but as soon as you answer, someone slams you across the head and you feel yourself being tossed into the car. You hear screeching tires, everything goes dark.

You open your eyes and see darkness. You're trapped in a hard box. A cold box just big enough to fit you in. Blindly, you touch every inch of it and feel something small lying beside you. You know it's a lighter. You flick it on. You're in what appears to be a gold box. A golden coffin.

Your breath quickens. You push against the box. You kick. You punch. You lose the lighter, find it, flick it on again, and you see a bit of writing engraved in the gold above you:

Hello, You. This golden bed is special. In six days we will open it. If you live, it's yours to keep. If you die, you're ours to harvest. Good night, You. Sweet dreams."

“Down the hall make a left, third door on your left.”

“Thanks,” I said getting up to leave.

I walked down the hall that was out of eye view from the couch we all had been gathered on.

“Third door on the..right?”

The door was closed so I assumed someone was in there.

“Hello?” No response, so I walked inside.

What I saw left me speechless.

“What the heck..?” I walked closer and It was a huge bulletin board with peoples faces..some crossed out with an X...
And then I saw Caroline’s face.

Underneath the board was a desk stacked with newspapers with titles ranging from “Mystery murderer strikes again,” and “A girl found dead..”

I took my phone out, checking behind me to see if anybody had noticed- by anybody I meant Cole.

Why does he have this in his house…

I heard the door open behind me and I whipped around to see a cat. 

“Oh..jesus little fella..you scared me.”

I turned back around and took a few photos of the bulletin board before feeling a tap on my shoulder.

“You know, the least you could’ve done was close the bathroom door and make it seem like you were in there.”

I turned around and almost dropped my phone.

“I- I’m sorry I was just-“

“I’m afraid you won’t be leaving here tonight.”

He was standing directly in front of me. He was 6’3 and I was 5’5, I really can’t leave..

“CAROLINE! CAROLINE COME HELP!” He just stood there just watching me.

I then went on my phone and went to the emergency call button.

He still stood there, smiling at me.

I then noticed in the top right corner I had no bars... 

“Listen I- I won’t tell anybody...We can pretend this didn’t even happen..”

The silence made this more eerie than before. 

“I’m just letting you enjoy these last moments.”

My eyes widened. 

Was he going t- Oh my god i’m going to die here... 

I then pushed past him and ran out the door into the living room.

Nobody was here...

They all had went home..

I didn’t even remember being gone that long how-?

I ran out the door to my car and tried to start it but I couldn’t get it to start. 

“Please- Just let me go- I won’t tell anybody..”

“I know you won’t. Remember that drink you had earlier? Let’s just say you won’t even remember meeting me.”"

Ok, perfectly normal day so far. When I was getting to my car, I happened to glance over at my neighbor watering the flowers with a big smile on his face. It was unusual behavior for sure, but I just shrugged and got in the car. 


It happened again on my way to work. Whenever I stop at a red light, I like to look at the other drivers to see what they're doing. Sometimes I see someone jamming out to the radio and get a good laugh out of it. Today however, everyone I looked at was smiling. Normally I wouldn't think too much about it, but this was definitely off. For one, their smiles looked strange, not the type of smile you'd see from someone having a good day, or remembering a funny scene from a movie. No, there was something artificial about it. Their mouth's were too wide, showing as many teeth as was humanly possible, and their eyes were opened uncomfortably wide as well. Almost like a psychopath trying to fit in...



There I go again. I'm always making up ridiculous stories in my head, or making things seem more sinister than they really are. It's the Christmas season of course, that's the reason why everyone's happy! Satisfied with my logical explanation, I started to smile as well to fit in. 



When I got to my office, I immediately noticed that the atmosphere was somehow different. Again, it's probably just me and my crazy stories. But I couldn't help but notice that the employees seemed a bit... lazier than usual. Very few words were spoken the entire day, I guess because it's hard to speak while you're smiling. Other than that, the office ran about as well as it usually does. I guess I shouldn't be too concerned, after all, it's just the spirit of Christmas getting to everyone, right? 



When I got home that night and looked in the mirror, I realized that I had the same wide-eyed, exaggerated grin as everyone else. Only now I couldn't change my expression at all, my face was just stuck like that. And you know what? There's nothing wrong with a little smile every now and again, or forever. After all, I live in a pretty happy town."

Someone banged at my door, Damian, my boyfriend, and I exchanged puzzled glances before he chirped happily,

“Pizza!” He hopped off the couch as I grabbed the remote to pause the movie. He came back but with a square box not a pizza box.

I stared at the box in his hand, “What’s that?”

He handed it to me, “A package for you.” I took it; there was no shipping label just my name in black sharpie. Taking a knife I cut the tape and opened it slowly; I removed most of the packaging peanuts to find a scuffed up looking magic 8 ball. I picked it up shook it and turned it over, the little icosahedron flipped before it landed on the number 32. I was confused. I did it again and a third time, shaking it a couple more times but the answer was always 32. 

“I thought you were supposed to ask the ball a question then it answers like yes or no or something.” Damian shrugged and dug in the box while I continued to shake the ball.

“Hey look at this...” He pulled out a note, “The Wonder Ball goes round and round so pass it quickly or you’ll be out. If you’re the one to hold it last… You. Are. Out.” He scratched his head handed me the messily written note. I took it as I passed him the ball. 

“This is kind of creeping me out.” I said, checking out the note.

He shook the ball and examined it just as I did before the doorbell rang. “Oh that must be the pizza!” He tossed the ball back into the box and I stared at it warily before placing the note on top and closing it.

We resumed our movie and once it was over we went to bed but I couldn’t sleep that night, something felt off. I tried to wake up Damian but he was dead asleep. I don’t know how long it was but eventually I fell asleep. When I woke up it was still dark, I got up to the bathroom and went to brush my teeth only when I heard a thump in the apartment did I stop. I quietly walked over to Damian refusing to look away at the door. I shook him lightly. “Damian…” but he didn’t budge.

I decided to grab the gun in our nightstand; I cocked it readying myself. I walked slowly and gripped the door handle. I took a deep breath and swung it open flipping on the lights; I held the gun steady as I scanned the apartment.  Once I was sure no one was here I lowered the gun and sighed, I turned back to look at Damian’s sleeping body, “Idiot…I could’ve died.” I took a step forward and my feet made contact with the ball. My heart froze as I stared at it. I picked up the ball and turned it over the little icosahedron now showing a 33."

“Dammit, Tom – now the cauliflower’s all dirty!” Jennie said, scooping it up and running it under cold water.

“Sorry, Jennie-O – I’m a bit clumsy with the knife.”

Jennie sidled up to the kitchen island with a bit of a waddle and topped off her wine. “That’s OK – I understand. Why don’t you start in on the main dish – and remember to save all the giblets for the gravy.”

“God – gravy’s my favorite! And *this* kind of gravy – now that’s what I’m talking about! I could gobble that shit up all damn day.”

“Well then – best get on it. The Fowlers will be here in a few minutes and I want to eat before the game starts.”

Tom took the heavy, plastic-wrapped parcel from the fridge and set about cutting it open and removing the glistening entrails. Watery blood slowly dripped from the plastic onto the floor.

He salted and stuffed the cavity with lemon, onions, and sprigs of rosemary. He boiled the giblets with a splash of white wine and shallots. The smell of sautéed onion and garlic permeated the small kitchen as pots and pans simmered on the stove. He deglazed the pan with sherry and added a little cream and flour to the gravy.

Jennie stirred the cranberries and added cupfuls of crystalline powder while singing *Pour some sugar on meeeeee...*

“OK, love – I think it’s ready for a taste. More salt?” Tom passed a spoonful of gravy to her.

“Oh, god – it’s so thick! And lumpy!” she squawked in delight. “Salt level is perfect – it tastes like heaven. Here – you try it!” She passed him the spoon.

He tasted it as he stirred the gravy, scraping the fond from the bottom of the pan. Eyeballs and bits of offal bobbed in the gravy pan. A look of pure bliss shone from his face and his feathers shivered with delight.

As Tom placed pearl onions into the empty eye sockets of the farmer and gently wedged an apple into his gaping mouth, he held his wineglass aloft in a bloody wing and toasted to his wife.

“Human gravy! My fucking favorite! This is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever!”"

It’s exhausting. The constant performance we have to put on. The show we have to act to get through life, satisfying our ridiculous needs.

Some people have it harder than others. Some people crave fame, recognition, infinite riches. Because, let’s be honest with ourselves-there are only a few people on this earth that are truly remarkable, that have achieved their deepest desires. It’s much easier to just give up and settle for less.

My sister wasn’t one of those people.She was determined to be seen. For all of my life, I had to watch as she attended beauty pageants, spent hours painting her face with makeup and yes, crying. Little miss perfect was never perfect enough. She always had to be more.

It wasn’t enough to be the popular and beautiful. She needed that “most”. Most popular. Most beautiful. And no one would stand on her way.

As you can probably guess, I wasn’t the favourite daughter. How could I be? She had to be. It was in her blood to be best. Too bad the perfection gene skipped me. Guess you could say I learned to live in the shadows.Turns out my desire wasn’t to be seen. Or, maybe not in the way my sister wanted to be seen.

I liked to be seen with a knife, being the sole reason someone’s life would end.

Don’t be so shocked. There are people like me everywhere. For every remarkable, amazing person you see in the television there is one of my kind. Looking for their next victim.

It was a dead giveaway that I would someday end up in the backstage of my sisters pageant. It was just my destiny to be here. Just before my sister was about to perform.

I blended in perfectly. I saw my sister’s blond hair, I got a glance at her blue dress before she disappeared into a bathroom. I followed her, trying to look innocent, like a proud family member who came to support their big sister.

My sister was applying her makeup next to a tall, Asian girl. I approached them, ready.

“Hi, sis”.

The Asian girl turned to look. I attacked, sinking the syringe into her neck. I slammed my hand against her mouth so she wouldn’t scream. For a minute, she tried to fight back. Then, slowly, her head fell forward and she collapsed to the floor.

I looked at my sister. She was standing there, lipstick in hand. Slowly, her lips twisted to reveal a smile.
“Thank you”.

“You'd better win”, I answered. “And you should leave. Before someone else comes”.

My sister nodded and walked away. I stared at the lifeless body and a smile creeped to my lips.

Sure, it’s not ideal, but she is my sister. And I’d do everything to her. For her to care about me.

Like I said, we all have a need to be seen."

I had a lot to be grateful for. A beautiful wife of 25 years, two perfect daughters, the remnants of a delicious Thanksgiving dinner, and last but not least, Merlot.

I poured myself another glass while the girls chatted away. My wife turned to me, “I think they’re ready,” she said.

“For wine?” my youngest daughter said, excitedly.

“No, goofball,” Sandy said, clearing her throat. “Thanksgiving is a tough holiday for your father. You girls know that. I think you’re old enough to know why.”

The girls sat up.

“If you’re ready, of course,” she whispered to me.

I nodded, then downed half my glass. After half a minute in silence, I began the story.

“I was eight years old when I lost my brother, my dad, three uncles, four aunts, and two cousins. We were celebrating Thanksgiving at Uncle Chase’s house—the one he grew up in. The adults were making food and the kids were decorating the ping pong table in the basement—the only table big enough to fit us all.

“While the other cousins carefully arranged the table, Chase and I went digging through the storage room for something funny we could use as a gag table decoration. At the bottom of an old dusty bin, we found the holy grail: A strobe-light fog machine. We filled it up with old bottles of fog liquid and hid it under a blanket near the stairs.”

I took another drink of Merlot.

“After an hour of patiently waiting, everyone was finally gathered around the ping pong table, eager to eat. When Uncle Phil proposed we say grace, Chase and I quietly moved to the staircase. Before anyone realized we had left, I whipped the blanket off the machine and turned the lights off. Chase cranked the fog machine to high and clicked on the strobe. The foul-smelling fog billowed into the basement, accompanied by the jarring flash of the strobe lights. I still remember that haunting smell. ‘WELCOME TO THANKSGIVING!’ Chase yelled. We waited for laughter that never came.

“There were a few harsh coughs, a scream, a thud, then crashing dishes. Our family members were being poisoned to death but were too disoriented from the incessant strobe lights against the dark, cloudy, windowless basement to escape.

“Since Chase and I were standing next to the stairs, and the fog was blowing away from us, it didn’t affect us as quickly. The lit candles started reacting to the rancid fog, spouting clouds of fire in all directions, igniting the rest of the table decorations.

“In the light of the fire, I saw my dad on the ground motioning for me to get out, mouthing the word ‘run.’ Chase and I ran up the stairs and called 911 while the rest of my family suffocated in the basement below.”

I poured more Merlot and the four of us stared at the unlit candles in the middle of the table in silence."

The poor protagonist knew there would be one but she had thought it would be something minor.

Of course it had been foreshadowed but she missed all the clues.

And in the end all that she had done, was for nothing, her entire adventure and all the progress she made.

She was the hero, she knew that.

Yet the plot twist changed her entire life, a twist so cruel that it was not from this world.

The realization dawned on her, her mind began to feel empty and hollow.

He never had enjoyed it, yet his mother would beam whenever he ate it. Although she was now gone, there was still a part of her in the casserole this Thanksgiving.

David was thankful for his father’s protective nature and firm commitment to his children. His father was his emotional support, his shield from danger.  Without him, David would have never survived all of his mental breakdowns, not those in the past, not the one now. He appreciated his dad for acting first when David needed to act last.

David had planned to break up with Joyce before Christmas to save himself from another awkward holiday and an unnecessary purchase. Her dumb, docile nature no longer excited him, yet, this Thanksgiving, he gave thanks for her unwavering devotion to him. She held him when he had wanted to run away.

Swallowing the lump in his throat, David gave thanks to his younger brother, Danny, the idiot wannabe occultist. Twenty years-old and still living at home, Danny never knew when to take things seriously. He had used the decorative candles for his “Thanksgiving séance” and had carved crude symbols into the turkey. David seethed thinking about his brother’s actions, yet he breathed deeply, thinking how grateful he was for Danny’s “antics.” He had to be.

David was thankful he was alive. As the demon lounged on the dining room table, David sat rigidly and expressed thanks for all he had. Half of Joyce lay across his lap. His father’s torso rested under the demon’s elbow. His mother was everywhere, and Danny’s head lolled in the demon’s hand. The demon pecked at his brother’s cheek as it stared at David. 

When David had grown breathless from expressing his gratefulness, the demon laughed at him.  Unlike his family, did David accept the monster’s presence? When others had fled and fought, was David willing to give thanks for witnessing such a wonder, for earning its mercy?

David bent his head toward the table in gratitude. The demon rose to its stubby legs, folds of skin hanging from its shriveled wings. A claw swiped across David’s face, taking with it a token of his thankfulness. Fire then overtook the demon, erupting into a black smoke and triggering the fire alarm. When the smoke had dissipated, the charred turkey lay in the demon’s place. 

David was thankful it had not taken more, and he cried as blood filled his mouth from where his tongue used to be. As he heard the sirens in the distance, he gave thanks he had an excuse to never speak of this Thanksgiving ever again."

It was said to began as a day of giving thanks and sacrifice for the blessing of the harvest of the preceding year. Everyone is excited. Even though preparation is utterly time-consuming, everyone took part and help out. We, us a community, try our best to keep the spirit of the tradition alive for generations to come. 

During the day of thanksgiving everyone gathers to watch as the president chooses to pardon a turkey. Everyone pitches in their best bet. But only the healthiest among the flock gets to be freed. To live and to grow. The rest are to be served in our community table. A feast that everyone had all been waiting for.

It's because we can only eat meat once a year. Its already hard enough for us humans to survive down here in the shelter. So needless to say we can't afford to grow animals too. Population is strictly controlled. Our consumption is greatly monitored. Our own harvests are the only thing we can consume. So we feel very blessed that we have thanksgiving. That one day that we get to splurge with the meat that we spent extra effort and months to care for. 

And now that I'm sixteen, I am allowed to partake in this year's thanksgiving. But I don't really care about the meat. Because I was one of the lucky turkey that got pardoned. I'm more excited to finally be able to contribute for the community. But I really hope my little turkey gets pardoned today. I pray that one day, she may carry on the tradition."

Just like in those sci-fi movies, I can shoot a concentrated ray of extremely hot energy through the tips of my fingers. When I point at something, it starts as warm and glowing red light. Then in a matter of seconds, the energy grows exponentially. 


So when I was a child, I pointed it at my friend and blew a precise hole out his head through his eye. This led my mother to cut my index finger clean off. This didn't help since the power began appearing on every finger and a faint glow would occasionally come out of my stub. 


I was abandoned, erased from any connection to my family, and was made a military dog. I grew up in a small white room with no windows. My hands were always closed, shackled in metal restraints, except on occasion when I was told to point in a very specific location by a tall man decorated in gold medals. Every now and then I could hear men outside my room, whispering about nations surrendering and how the world was unifying under a central power. 


I hated them. The way they whispered and shuffled about outside. I hated the room, it's blindingly white surface. I hated the shackles, I hated the tall man with the gold medals, and I hated living. So when they told me to point straight up with all 9 of my fingers one day, I refused. Everything within a 10-mile radius was reduced to smoldering ash as I spun with glowing hands outstretched.

After lots of planning, we had finally gotten to this small beach. Our trip had been very long, but we finally got here. It was very dark, and all we could see was the ocean and the sky. The moon was nearly full and I hadn’t felt so happy in months. 


That first night was incredible, we danced, laughed and shared a few drinks on that beach. The next few days went by quickly. I guess time does fly when you’re having fun. We had set up camp not too far from a very, very small fishing community. The locals had been very kind to us, showing us the region, the best sights, their daily life, sharing their food and drinks with us. This morning we told them we were leaving tomorrow, and some people, specially the children, seemed saddened by the news. 


Just before we left to spend the afternoon at the beach, they told us to come by in the evening. They were having a special ceremony and they said they’d be honored to have us as guests. Evening came, and we went back to town.


The town was composed of several little houses built from wooden planks. This was a very poor community, and they had kept the traditions from their ancestors. They told us tonight was a very special night: they were having a “chiguano” for the daughter of one of the families. It was a funerary rite. They gave us all coffee and cigarettes for those who smoked.


They had built a kind of altar for the body. She was just a baby, about a year old. They had put on some candles around it, and started singing. The music was festive. We were not very comfortable, to be honest, but… Who were we to judge these people and their traditions? We sat there quietly. Around midnight, they gave us some more coffee and asked us to gather around the family. 

 

We were guests of honor, so we were sat on the porch of the house. The mother sat behind us with a drum, and she started playing some of their traditional songs, and the father picked up the body. He started dancing around with it, and approached each and every one of us. Suddenly, I felt dizzy. I was too tired, and didn’t even feel like moving. As I looked around, my friends seemed to be falling asleep. 


The father kept on dancing. The drums grew more and more frantic with every second that went by. My eyes felt heavier and heavier. The music started to sound further, and further away. I must’ve been very tired. I’m pretty sure I started dreaming, cause I could swear that the baby had just opened her eyes."

My red-haired boyfriend, stopped messing with his plate, shaking his head with a good-natured smile, the action making some of his curls fall out of his beanie and against his forehead. 

“It’s a little bit far to travel with a guy who’s temporarily blind,” he said, tapping his dark sunglasses and putting his hand on mine. “Maybe next year, right angel?”

My uncle Spence took that answer well enough, but the half-empty bottle of scotch beside him told me that the personal questions to my new significant other wouldn’t stop any time soon. 

“What do they do? Your parents,” Uncle Spence mumbled through a mouthful of stuffing. 

“Well, my father is in... Politics.” 

Uh-oh. Here it was. 

“He’s a bipartisan lawyer, so no worries. He deals with offenses from all parties,” Solomon interjected before Uncle Spence could be a smartass.

Spence nodded, swallowing some mashed potatoes. “Your father a religious man?” 

“Yes sir. He is most certainly a man who believes in God,” Solomon squeezed my hand, his lips curling into a smile against his pale face. 

Aunt Jenna offhandedly commented on how a wedding in a Christian church would be nice, as opposed to a courthouse wedding like Beth, my cousin who was with her wife’s family for the holidays. My mom elbowed her, as sisters do. Especially more-accepting sisters. 

Solly laughed genuinely, pulling me closer to him. 
“Don’t tell me it’s so obvious I’m thinking of making Kat my wife! Oh, you wouldn’t mind passing the ham to us, would you?”

—

I slammed the door to the car, laughing incredulously. “Bipartisan lawyer...? Deals with offenses from both parties? Believes in God? Temporarily blind?! Really, Solomon?!” 

“They didn’t suspect anything. I think they even liked me,” my boyfriend yawned, stretching out his seat to nap on the way back to our hotel. 

I calmed myself, gripping the wheel with less anger. 
“I guess you’re right... They did like you. That just seemed a little bit too close to the truth, you know..? Solly, I really do like you. What if they start to suspect—?” 

Solomon pulled his beanie off, shaking his coppery hair out to reveal his small horns. He glanced at me from beneath his sunglasses with his deep, wine-colored eyes. “Oh, come on. You know that was the most creative way you’ve ever heard someone describe the Devil.”"

*What was that?*

He could have sworn he heard something in the house, at this time of night. But what was it?

Grumbling to himself, he got out of his bed and opened the door to the hallway. It smelled funny. Where was the scent coming from?

He looked around a little bit, trying to find the source.

Was it downstairs?

He realized it was.

Gary quietly made his way down the steps, trying not to make a sound. He silently walked to the living room.

The scent was at its strongest, but all he could see was a broken window.

He looked on in surprise and confusion. *What happened here?* He thought. Perhaps he should call the authorities?

No, maybe not. He didn’t feel like it.

He turned around, and in front of him stood a figure, shrouded by darkness.

Gary stared at the figure, and smiled.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” He said, as his eyes turned yellow.

He began to grow taller. His hair grew into fur. His teeth became fangs, his fingernails claws.

From deep within, he let out a howl- not like a wolf’s howl, but an inhuman, primal scream- and rushed forth.

The figure threw something.

In the span of a few seconds, the beast dropped down to the floor, crying out in agony. The silver knife had hit its mark, and the pain from its bite somehow enveloped the creature’s entire being. The wound swelled up, and it grew larger, and larger, and larger, until it exploded in a gruesome display of ichor. The blade fell onto the ground, stained with crimson.

By then, there were only groans of pain, each weaker than the last.

The figure picked up his tool and walked up to the miserable thing. He knelt beside it as its vision began to fade, the moonlight from outside illuminating his horrifically scarred face.

“Say hi to my family for me,” he said."

The first thing that happened was that the city started to have earthquakes. This was extremely weird because the city have a 200 year reputation for not having earthquakes. The most weird part is that they started to happen extremely occasionally about once a day. This was the most weird part but after the 35th earthquake the earthquakes started to behave differently

They have a designated path they went like a long V and then a line through the middle. When it hit 55 earthquakes the Vs surrounded the city and was very unsettling. The earthquakes stopped happening but people were scared what would happen next, to most moved away. And they were right. 

Then Vs started to become ravines and very deep almost extremely deep. But what shocked everyone in the city was that the Vs were getting wider and making a circle with them combining. Then what happen next shocked the world. Barrages of astroids meteors. They hit everywhere but Vaughburg and someone reported that they saw a asteroid hit the top of Vaughburg and dissipate.

After 134 days they world became inhabitable except Vaughburg. The Vs got extremely wide and what we saw next was so shocking that I saw 30 people dying from shock. Little people wit with golden wings took people of all types. They got pulled under only some chosen ones got chosen that night nobody got any sleep from the screaming. Then on the second night the people came back up but with golden wings and looked deformed. On the third night the building slowly got taken down and the ground got barren. On the fourth night the sun went down forever. On the fifth night all the animals disappeared. On the sixth night people started to disappear, by the end of the day I was the only one left. On the seventh day I saw earth disappearing and the demons winning"

I sat on the couch, and paused the movie as my phone vibrated. A new text, from Mom. ""We're staying over Uncle Markus' tonight, U okay with that?"" I figured since it was getting late, and Uncle Markus lives a few hours away my parents where too tired to drive home. ""Yeah, no problem. Love you."" I texted.

""What time do you think you guys will be back?""

I sat around waiting for a response, I figured Mom fell asleep. Just as I resumed the movie, I heard a car door slam shut from the driveway. My heart pounded, Wallace got up and looked through the window. As he barked I noticed he seemed excited, not aggressive, so the idea of it being an intruder was out of the way. I peeked out the window to see my parents, exiting their car. Confused, but relieved, I went and unlocked the front door. Mom and Dad stepped inside the house, they where holding grocery bags. My phone goes off, I look at it.

""5PM Tomorrow. That alright?"" ...From Mom.

""Hey Alice, sorry we took a while. We decided to stop at the store and pick up a few things."" Dad said, as he placed the bags on the kitchen counter. ""We didnt mean to take that long."" Mom added on, placing her bags down as well. They began putting the groceries away, I sat down, confused. Maybe the text came through late? Maybe they changed their mind? Suddenly, another text came through.

""There's food for tomorrow in the fridge.""

""U there?""

I looked up at Mom, who was still putting groceries away. ""Uh, Mom, I think someone has your phone."" I said, standing up and walking towards her. ""What do you mean?"" She said, cocking an eyebrow. I showed her the texts. ""That's... not possible."" She reached into her pocket, taking out her phone. ""Call the number."" She said, in a demanding voice. I did as she said, the call went through. Moms phone rang, she looked at me with a confused expression. ""Must be some kind of glitch?"" Dad said, I shrugged. ""What's the number? I'll call from my phone."" She said, as she began typing our area code. ""It starts with the same area code as our numbers, right?"" I double checked the number. ""Its your number."" I said, I was freaked out. ""What do you mean?"" I showed her, she huffed and dialed in her own number into her phone. I thought it was silly, you cant call your own phone number using your phone.

Ring... ring... ring...

e26bm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e26bm0/you_suffer_but_why/,"You Suffer, But Why?",3,1,1574809304.0,"Last year, I had an interview with Nicholas Bullpen, former lyricist for the band ""Napalm Death"". He holds the current world record for the shortest song ever recorded, ""You Suffer"", consisting of just 4 words:


*""You suffer*

*but why?""*


His simple composition had disturbed my very core as a philosophy student. Never did I think that I would find such unconventional thought in a rock song. This was his last interview; he was found dead, hanging from a ceiling fan a month after this incident.

I was called to his residence for our meeting. We sat in a small, nearly empty room in his apartment, with dim lights and bare grey walls - an unexpectedly depressive place.

That day, he seemed particularly distressed -- his behaviour reflected anxiety, sweating and trembling uncontrollably.

""Hello, Mr. Nicholas. Before we start, I wanted you to know that I am amazed by your piece. To be honest, rock music never interested me much, but this is a poetic gem. I would like to go deeper into its intended meaning with your help.
...

""Mr. Nicholas?""

He just sat there, motionless. I could barely hear him breath. It wasn't as if he simply didn't care, rather, it seemed he was reliving something in his head: a memory too scarring for his brain to comprehend.

Nervous yet determined, I continued.

""You know, I have dwelled over many of its interpretations. I like to think that it may be what a therapist says to a depressed patient, as an offer of help. Or, it may be what God says to a suffering atheist, to guide them on the path of spiritual belief. What do you think?""

I waited. And waited.

...

""Mr. Nicholas, what do you think about those interpretations?""

Then, he started to laugh. Sporadic chuckles soon turned to maniacal laughter. He almost fell off his seat, as if he was mocking my stupidity.

His eyes filled with tears. I finally heard his voice, raspy and filled with pure fear. But it was the tinge of humour in his voice that struck the highest note of insanity.


*""no no no no NO*


*don't you get it? let me tell you*


*they were the last w-words he said.*


*a question consciously left unanswered.*

Log 03: The stunning view of our green planet helps keep the crew grounded (get it?) Mission control says we can come back anytime, but with all our rations, and our tight-knit crew, that won’t be necessary.

Log 06: And we have successfully made it halfway to Mars! At this rate, we’ll be home in just another six months

Log 07: I have the best news! So, recently, Alyssa has been acting a little weird, especially around Donovan. I was, like, an hour off from asking mission control what might be up, when Donovan called a crew meeting. It turns out that Alyssa is having a baby! Hazel has some kids back home, so she can sure help, and Donovan says I can be the kid’s godfather!

Log 08: Poor Alyssa’s been quite tired lately, what with the little astro-baby growing in her tummy, so I helped her finish up preforming matinence on the ship. It was all worth it to feel that little one kick!

Log 12: Bless my stars and holy cow! That’s right, September 14, 2032, the day the Sunscraper lands on Mars! Plus, the greatest thing just happened... Alyssa’s water broke! Hazel and I are helping her through labor right now, and though we don’t know much, I’m honored to help birth the first baby born on Mars!

Log 13: 6 pounds, 17 inches, and one scrunchy little button nose; Alyssa’s little girl is born! They’re naming her Sunny- only fitting for someone born on the great Sunscraper!

Log 15: Living with Sunny has proven to be... a challenge. She’s so loud that it’s hard for me to chart courses. Even though Donovan does the back-breaking work of examining the horticulture, he still makes some time for his little girl, which is amazing.

Log 16: Only 2 months old, and her first word? This kid is a record setter on so many levels! Of course, she’s keeping it to simple “Mamas” and “Papas” for now, but that’s still amazing!

Log 17: Oh dear. Today, Donovan was acting super strange. He stole away to the plant room earlier than usual, and when I walked in to check up on him, holding Sunny in my arms, he screamed at me, knocking over one of our precious plants in the process. 

Log 19: So, we were digging through the plant room’s drawers, trying to find some extra seeds to let Sunny plant (taking after her father.) We opened up one of the drawers, and inside was Sunny’s bonnet, hand-knit by Hazel. Sunny was in my arms at that time, and she was wearing the bonnet on her head. I asked Hazel if she made doubles, but she told me she didn’t have the thread. I was so busy puzzling over it that I slipped and mischarted our route. It’ll as about a month to our voyage, but we’re making such great time that it shouldn’t matter.

Log 20: Shit, shit, shit, shit. Alyssa found Donovan’s body stuck in one of the outer walls while doing outside matinence. Or, we think it’s his body, because we still see him around. When I call his name, though, he doesn’t seem to notice. I’ve just gotta make sure Sunny can’t know.

Log 22: Alyssa and Hazel have stopped doing their jobs. I snap at them to fix the thruster or flick a switch for the ninth time, but they just stare blankly at the thing they’re supposed to be working on until I do it myself. On a brighter note, Earth is a tiny speck, but it’s getting closer!

Log 23: Hazel seems to want to spend a lot of time with me lately, and Sunny is getting needier.

Log 25: The crew members are talking amongst themselves, grinning and looking back at me. Even Sunny won’t tell me what they’re doing.

Log 26: Fuck. I found the bodies.

Log 27: And we continue forging forward, just one tight-knit crew on one tight-knit ship on our way back to the great green planet we call home!"

That was the moment when she whispered to me, she told me to get back to the car, but I didn't listen, I stayed there as the fire was slowlly covering the soaking carpets, feeling the ever increasing heat and the smell of burned gas. She then screamed at me, I turned towards her, she was in this blue hospital clothing but I could see red blood was dripping from what seemd to be a preety significant cut, covered by the blue-ish robe. She left a trail of blood as she walked towards me and whispered to me again ""Get back to the car and do as I say!""
    As I walk back from the ruble I'm telling myself that I'm gonna listen to her from now on. I have the strange feeling that if I even think of disobeing her again, she would now.
    I slowly open the car door, but why am I opening the back one?

I want to stay with him in there, but she quickly brings me back to reality by telling me to leave him there and get back in the car.
    While staying in front of the stearing wheel a tought comes in my mind, a spark of truth flourishes as I open the glove box, I find there my old hunting knife, I put the cold metal blade against my neck, the blade still feels sharp after all theese years. 
    I'm right about to start cutting when she abruptly stops me, I freeze for a bit, with my knife agianst my neck, I look towards the pasanger seat and there she is, ""Stay with me, don't do it, stay and we could be toghether!"" she tells me, I respond ""I have to, I'm doing this so we can be together."",She slowlly leans towards me, and with her lips against my ear she whisperes You did what I told you, now drop the knife so we can be together, here, only us .So I drop the knife and I turn to face her while she tells me, I love you, as I start kissing her cold lips, sirens slowlly blaring from behind."

She approached the door, reached for the knob. 

“Don’t.”

“Please.”

Something leaned closer. She felt it pressing itself against her. 

She wanted to turn around and see. 

She wanted to yell and scream, and run away from the owner of the voice. 

Ms. Sharpe wanted to do a lot of things. But at the same time, she didn’t want to any of them.

There’s nothing like watching a family you’ve just met celebrate the most patriotic day of the year, filled with pride in their country, before ripping them apart. Seeing the life drain from their eyes along with any faith their precious nation could protect them, all because they foolishly agreed to host a stranger for Thanksgiving.

This year's victims, the Morrison family, should fare no better.

“Happy Thanksgiving, sir” I beam from the front porch as the door opens.

“Whatever, *mate*” the host replies with a groan, collecting my yam dish from me. “It's not like it’s *my* holiday.”

Normally, I’d be filleting his family with a carving knife right about now. But I’m thrown. This isn’t the patriotic schmuck I’d expected to butcher.

“You’ll have to excuse my expat husband"" explains the man's blonde wife at the dinner table, in a matching accent to his. ""Lucas is quite a *Grinch* when it comes to Thanksgiving.”

“He’s not American?” I tentatively ask, attempting to appear a polite guest.

“Neither of us are” Chloe replies. “Our family is actually from Sydney, but when I got a teaching opportunity here in North Carolina last year, I begged Lucas and the kids to relocate to the States.”

“I just don’t understand why *we’re* celebrating these damn Yankee holidays!” snipes Lucas from across the table. “Stuffing’s overrated, and the kids *hate* turkey.”

My attention turns momentarily to the two seated children pushing food around their plates.

“Seriously, Chloe, even *you* don’t like American traditions. I know you’ll take a VB can over fancy eggnog any day. This just isn’t *us*.”

Chloe merely sighs. Apparently, even she can’t deny the truth in her husband’s words. 

Unlike any year before, I depart the house this evening with a farewell and not an ounce of bloodshed. There will be no killing tonight.

2 months later, there’s still a nip in the air as I return to the familiar home.

Despite the winter cold, I can hear sounds of a celebration emanating from their backyard. Intrigued, I unlatch the rear gate.

Across the yard is a table piled high with meat pies, pavlovas, lamingtons, ANZAC biscuits and Tim Tams. A barbeque of sausages burns while Gang Gajang blasts from a stereo. Tan kids race around cricket stumps as Lucas and Chloe stand nearby laughing, hand in hand and flip-flops on feet. In an instant, I can see that the couple are finally in their element.

My heart swells to glimpse such patriotism in this family. It’s what I wanted from the Morrisons all along. 

The smile remains on my face as I rush forward and drive my knife deep into Lucas’s gut, whispering him a greeting as his loved ones scream.

“Happy Australia Day, mate.”"

The shooters are lined up behind the firing line. The range instructor demonstrates where to aim for the most effective kill shot, pointing at the target. I realize the target is me and I'm facing the shooters. They aren't human but large birds instead. Their eyes are fierce, their wattles a vengeful red. My eyes dart around confused, the only part of my body able to move. The instructor spouts off a command before raising a feathered wing. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the wing come swiftly down in an executing motion. The guns fire. I wake up.

""Interesting,"" said Doc, the back of his chair facing me. ""Please, continue.""

There's a lot of noise, a mixture of whirring machines and panicked voices. The air is thick and stuffy, tainted with death. My family is there. I'm relieved but not for long. Now we're moving on a mechanical belt. We try to make a run for it but our feet are quickly subdued. We're suddenly jerked upright, hanging upside down from our shackles. A brief pause and we're moving again. I hear an abrupt but short scream let out beside me followed by heavy dripping, like water pouring on the ground. Another scream but closer, accompanied with that same pouring sound. Another scream and my heart seizes. The scream is my own. I gurgle as my mouth fills with warm blood. I gasp as more escapes from my throat. I wake up.

""Yes, very curious,"" Doc contemplated. ""And you think this is all suppressed guilt from your slaughterhouse days manifesting into nightmare form?""

""Unfortunately, yes but I won't bore you with the next one. Surely I don't have to tell you how watching the cooking network where the chef is a maniacal turkey and you're the one being roasted can seriously fuck with your head, do I?""

""No, certainly not. Besides, that's all the time we have for today anyway,"" Doc concluded. ""I think you've made a real breakthrough though,"" he reassured. ""But what I'm curious about is how you can still live with yourself,"" he inquired as his chair slowly began to turn around. ""Beg pardon?"" My hands unconsciously clenching the arm rests of my leather chair.

""You know, we don't really care too much for Thanksgiving,"" Doc explained. ""It's never really been considered a holiday...for us. And we certainly can't blame everyone."" His chair began to creak. ""But we can blame someone...""

I closed my eyes for just a second and began my breathing exercises Doc and I worked on in an earlier session. When I opened them, the chair was completely turned around and facing me. But it was empty. Had I imagined it all? Was this a nightmare too? Just as I felt myself relaxing, I sensed a looming presence behind me, a ragged breath on the back of my neck, a faint rustling of feathers.

Cluck, cluck...GOBBLE! I never woke up again."

Well, it’s either Guinness with the buds or the record books tonight and I’d venture to say either challenge serves adequately to dullen my senses. The only difference is I’m not usually this perceptive when my surroundings are pitch-black. Do I always tap my feet this much? Jeez, it sounds like an active construction site in here. Why has no one noted as such? Maybe they have and it just hasn’t made the rounds to me yet. I wish I could quell my stream of thoughts by noting the numerous quirks of the acoustic panels I saw moments prior in all their sightly glory. I’m only half-joking as with time I feel I’ve begun to miss even their presence. Some of them even stuck out a fair bit. 

This is what I’m reduced to now. A one-man comedy routine. Tough crowd. If I had opted for the bottles maybe I wouldn’t be regretting this until the day after at least. Oh well, I’d venture it’s too late to back out now. As I sit bound to this chair, I almost start to forget it’s even there. I can’t see what’s around me, neither what lies in wake ahead. Little twinkles of unknown origin fill the field of my vision as I envision myself hurling off into the cosmos with the strength of my consciousness alone. As someone who spent a lot of time with my head in the clouds, I never knew constellations were equally as simple to make out. I imagined I still had hands and charted the ones I saw accordingly. Why? Well, I’m unsure myself but I like to think that there’s a sense of purpose waiting to be sought out. Closure. No body to weigh me down. As such, I couldn’t afford to miss a beat. Especially now that I’ve been granted an opportunity of this caliber.

And yet, I was neglecting something quite alarming. Deafening thumps alongside ghastly gurgles lurked in unexplored regions beyond and appeared to be homing in on my immediate position. Regardless of the trajectory I chose, I couldn’t escape their presence. I imagined I was plugging up my ears to escape the menacing frequencies which only served to intensify the gurgling. Suddenly a screech broke through my defenses entirely. I felt like I was caught smack dab in an earthquake. A light source brighter than anything I’ve ever experienced lit the room I once again found myself in. I was contained. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone. The momentary clarity of the display following the blinding ray of light was short-lived, as droplets added a scarlet tint to the over-saturated display. My left hand illuminated in the darkness revealed a wound that looked less like the vivid constellations I’d seen earlier, and more to the effect of fresh coffee stains. Progressively the blood vacating my ear canals lessened in intensity until it was reminiscent of rain pattering."

The brave hero rode his steed through the cursed forest, slashing his divine blade through the thorny vines that tried to tackle him.

He eyed the castle in the distance, or what was left of it.

A ruin, a painful reminder of the old glory days of the Kingdom.

As he slashed his way through the forest his gaze was locked on the highest northern tower, the only one that remained standing after hundred years.

He escaped the forest and quickly found his way to the stone bridge.

He charged over the bridge on his white horse, the red moon shining above him, determination written on his face.

Fate was with him, he was the destined hero to break the horrible curse that put the entire castle to sleep 100 years ago.

Up in the tower, was the princess.

His love of his life, his destiny.

But before he entered the castle a giant dragon appeared, scales black as the night and green eyes filled with murderous intent.

""Stop!"" the dragon roared with a human voice, ""Don't go any further! Or you'll die-""

Before the dragon could finish the hero had jumped off his steed and flew towards the dragon. With one mighty swipe he decapitated the dragon.

He sheathed his sword and ran through the old castle doors and made his way through the castle.

As he ran tried to find the stairs that led up the castle he saw people sleeping all over the place. They looked sickly pale but they were still breathing.

The curse that the witch had put on the castle 100 years ago was responsible for this, he heard the legends. 

The princess, a true love kiss from a hero.

The curse would be broken by a hero.

He was that hero!

Not long after he that he found a stairwell that led up to the tower he was looking for.

He passed a sleeping guard that had fallen asleep 100 years ago.

He had no idea why the Witch had cursed the entire castle 100 years ago but he would break it.

He was the hero after all.

He  reached the top of the tower and opened the door that led to the room where he would find the princess.

His heart tightened as he stepped forward, “time to break the curse.” he muttered and knelt down to kiss her.

Not a second later he felt her breath stagger, her eyes shot open as she looked at the one who broke her curse.

She kept kissing him though, the hero was a bit surprised but eagerly accepted it.

Something sharp bit down on his lip and his eyes widened, he saw the princess’s red eyes staring into his, filled with bloodlust, the princess moved her mouth to his neck, he felt two sharp teeth sunk into his throat.

Blood spilled and the princess eagerly sucked away, as his vision darkened a final thought passed his mind.   
‘Humans don’t sleeps for 100 years.’"

It was early morning as we walked there meaning the frost had settled on the grass and it was frigid. ""Nothing out of the ordinary. It's Scotland."" I reassured myself.

When we reached the house it was, dark green with mouldy windows and seemingly an endless amount of them. Scared, we pressed onward. Entering the house we hear a CRRREEEEEAAAAK as we stand on one of the floorboards. We take out our torches and search the nearby rooms. I walk into a kitchen, another ominous door is at the other end. I grab a sharp, long knife just incase.

Walking into the other room, it's a dining room. To be honest it makes sense that the nearest room to the kitchen would be the dining room. ""I'ᴍ ᴜɴᴅᴇʀ ᴛʜᴇ ꜰʟᴏᴏʀʙᴏᴀʀᴅs."" I hear, ""ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ, ʜᴇʟᴘ ᴍᴇ."" I am scared as hell as I lift up the floorboard and find a crystal ball.

As I look into the crystal ball I see the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the room I'm in containing a crystal ball showing the entrance where five people are coming in, twitching uncontrollably with an unnatural gait. They look familiar, too familiar. And as I stare, one of them looks back. Me. 

I start running, not for the entrance *they* are there. But instead, up the stairs, I run to a door, to the tower and see one of my friends, or their doppelganger throwing the other one off the tower. The one who killed themself turns towards me and starts twitching horribly and unnaturally. He walks towards me, too slowly to be human.

I swftly take out the knife and drive it through their chest. Underneath the skin, I see a light skeleton. Snapping the knife away and pushing them down the tower. There was no blood on the knife, no human blood. The knife starts to melt. A clear liquid, not unlike water, drips onto my hand and a searing burn spreads around my body. Melting off the skin that I had collected."

She was smart, a dark haired conniving nympth, with eyes like burning coal. She stood above her fellows in demure boredom. Smart and wise and fast, cold-hearted and otherworldly. Oca was many things, and fucked was one of them.

It wasn't a good game. Teresa could testify to that. As always Oca had fucked her truly over, she never listened to anyone, not even her sister. And now they were in the forest behind their house, running for their lives. All at the mercy of Oca's ability to protect them, and the Creature.

Oca had sat in the darkness of the trees over looking a burning fire. 3 friends and Teresa watched her chant Latin, and none stopped her. ""Mutatio in tenebris et umbra reseras creatura mille!""And with that they summoned the Creature.

The Creature was a being without name, or of reputation. Older than the hills he stalked, and born from mortals in times before the great redwoods he slept under existed. He was many things; but could only be described as skin and bones and sharpness. Hunger was his nemesis, flesh his nicotine; stomach a pit without end. And he was on the hunt. A thousand teeth longing to kiss flesh. Without effort he had massacred the friends and ripped them into so many pieces even the reaper struggled to recognize them. Beautiful and ageless, without hesitation and with the ease of an ancient eagle taken flight he had killed them. And now he was searching for his final victims.

Oca was one thing the Creature had never seen before. She was a challenge. She moved without hesitation, and acted without remorse. Unblinking as he ate her friends, uncaring as he ripped them apart. The only thing holding her back was Teresa.

Teresa hid behind the bush next to Oca. Night air moved around them, and it was peaceful and quiet. Unnervingly quiet. Oca lifted her head and listened around.

""What have you done, Oca?!"" Teresa whispered loudly.

""Shh.""

Then a rustle in the leaves. ""Fu-"" 

It jumped, clawed fingers stretching effortlessly towards their targets.

Oca knew what she had to do to survive. She was a survivor. It was just a push, and it changed everything.

The Creature stared at Oca as he ate his meal. She was something strange, unique. Something was changed in the Midsummer air, something old that he hadn't seen in years long before the forest grew to their mighty status. In wonder he watched her move, not away in fear, but she was staring at him. It was cold of her to do what she did, but she was a survivor. And though things changed in the centuries he had been asleep, survival would always be the motivator of metamorphosis. Oca was many things, but she could best be described as skin and bones and sharpness. In a raspy forgotten voice the Creature murmured, ""Hungry, Sister?"""

“Ugh! I can’t!” Anessa, Ben’s fiancée, stormed out.

“Real nice mom, thanks.” Ben chased Anessa.

Hours later Anessa awoke startled by Ben’s mother standing at her bed.
“I’m not a hateful person,” Ben’s mother said. “Conspiracy theories? End times? The president is just the prick in office. I was only trying to repulse you.” 

Anessa sat up and stared silently at the old woman.

“Five miscarriages before Ben. He was premature. Doctors gave him a week. I went to chapel every night and dropped to my knees. But God didn’t answer those prayers Thanksgiving night— something else did.”

“Mrs. Halstead, you’re freaking me out.”

“I’m tired, Anessa. I’ve played the part of bi-polar mommy for thirty years. Pretending to be a mental case to scare people away. Ben lost friendships, relationships because of me. It was only to keep the deal.”

“What deal? I don’t understand.” Anessa said. 

“Come with me.”

Ben’s mother led Anessa to Ben’s room. “You love my son? Prove it.” Ben’s mother opened the door.
Surrounding Ben were black figures with glowing, green eyes. Anessa saw figures of all sizes, watching quietly.

One figure went to them jingling keys, “I can’t believe it, my own car, thanks Mom!” It moved back into shadows, jingling the keys until it disappeared into darkness.

These figures were Ben at different ages! The dark figure moved back into the shadows with the others and the bed shook.

A black tentacle grew under the bed, spewing dark liquid to the floor. The tentacle writhed as a bulge grew inside and throbbed towards the tip. Ben screamed in his sleep. The dark figures screamed in the shadows, green light emanating from their mouths. Another Ben, with burning green eyes, plopped from the tentacle tip. Anessa saw the real Ben sleeping peacefully. Ben’s double arose from the floor.

Ben’s mother broke the silence and startled Anessa, “You have to strangle it.”

“WHAT?!?”

“It won’t struggle. They never do,” Ben’s mother said. “If you don’t kill it, Ben— real Ben, will die. This must be done once a year. That was the deal.”

“Mrs. Halstead...I — what the fuck?!”

“That’s ok, dear. Move, please.” Ben’s mother moved in front of Anessa as the clone dropped to its knees. 

“Did you have a good Thanksgiving, Mom?” The green eyed clone asked with a smile. Ben’s mother wrapped her hands around its neck.

“— wait,” Anessa said to Ben’s mother, taking her place.

The next morning, Ben found his mother whistling, cleaning dishes as Anessa searched the fridge. Anessa slid a plate of bacon and eggs in front of Ben. He looked at his mother then whispered to Anessa, “Everything ok?”

“Great!” Anessa said.

“Coffee anyone?” Ben’s mother asked.

“I’d love some, Mrs. Halstead,” Anessa said.

“Uh-uh,” Ben’s mother chided with a smile. “What did we say about that?”

“Sorry! I’d love some coffee, mom.”"

But once love has a hold of you, it clouds your vision and makes you do unimaginable things. He is my everything, I killed them all, my family, for him. Their flesh bursting, bloating out of their skin. As if it was a seam ripping from a stuffed toy. The contents leaking. But before I continue, lets talk about before.

It was Thanksgiving day, I had invited both sides of my family. I never liked my family, all they did was fight. Always bickering around me, but never including me. But today, I thought let's invite my family for one last stay. Introducing them to...the new way of Thanksgiving. I was preparing food for all my family, and when I thought I had made enough food, I made more. I am one hell of a chef, and witch. Not joking either, my family never gave a rat's ass about me as a child, I got into the Occult and spellcasting. As my family arrived for their  meal, I took them one by one and hexed them. Eventually they were all at my dinner table, bringing them each their own turkey. I had baked 16 fucking turkeys for my ungrateful family. 16 platters of stuffing, potatoes, yams, and boy a shit ton of vegetables. Different amounts of each thing. 

Remember how I said I ""hexed"" them? I finally  sat down and watched my hex take place, I watched my family eat, and eat, and eat. They didn't stop, I watched the food go down and after 30 minutes the food digested. They washed it down with 2 gallons of water each, and that's what made their skin burst. But my uncle ate way, way more than I was ever expecting. He fucked everything up. I wasn't planing on putting my newborn nephew on the menu. He wiggled in my arms as I picked him up and set him on the counter, I pulled out my best knife. Killed him, cut him into small pieces. Small enough to bite. Since my uncle hadn't quite had ""enough"" food yet. My uncle's last meal, his son. The worst part was not necessarily watching them die, it was when I dragged their dead bodies down into the basement, their insides leaking out. 

But was it all worth it? Fuck yeah. Now here I sit every night gazing into the stars through thick brushed pine. Next to him, his beautiful dark green eyes stare into mine. His dark brown wavy hair flows like nothing else I have ever seen in the cold wind. I lay my head on his slim chest with all the love I could give in a life time. I love him for what he is, the demon that corrupted me. But out of love. We did this together for one thing he asks, be mine forever. I just worry about when I will have to feed him again."

The man was running gasping for breath in the dark, hoping his feet would stay true where his eyes could not. The imprints he left within the mud were deep, the muck seemed to cling to the soles of his boots with each exhausted stride. All of his effort was for naught. He knew this, what he was running from could not be avoided. He did not know why he was fighting it, but he had given in to the primal passion of escape. Accountability cannot be hidden from, it cannot be outpaced, and it will not be cowed by the pathetic intimidation tactics of any living creature. The man knew this, his strength was failing him, but he did not have the courage to stand up to his overbearing aggressor. His transgressions were so great that there could only be one consequence to atone for them, a punishment he could not shoulder. So, he fled until he ran out of land to crush with his boots, and water to disturb with his flailing. He was at the end of a long road filled with crimes, and victims. His comeuppance had arrived in all of its horrifying massiveness. He looked up at its imposing figure, and he wept, for the man knew that he was doomed."

“Go fetch one yaj,” my grandmother points with her lips towards the corral housing dinner. Her sun-burned, hardened hands are busy setting up butchering tools on a wooden table. She’s set up outside near some tall wooden posts – meant for hanging sheep while she cuts into them.

I rush towards the corral. There’s a family of eight. Each lie on their sides, their four limbs bound together in front of them with barbed wire. 

I spot a medium sized sheep and run towards it, sliding in shit as I go. I manage to stay upright, and with my shoes caked in excrement I continue. All the beasts around me are braying loudly, except for a tiny calf whose stiffened, dead legs stick up in the air, resembling an overturned stepstool. 

I approach my writhing victim and lift it by the ankles. It thrashes crazily in my grasp, making the transfer difficult, until its struggle unintentionally results in it snapping its own ankles. The sheep hollers in agony as it swings limply in my hands. I haul the creature to my grandmother and she positions a metal tub under the wailing beast's head, then cuts the neck purposefully, smartly. Blood pools into the tub quickly, and the sheep slowly stops twitching. The head is then removed. My grandmother then snaps off the broken ankles and begins cutting away skin, working her up. After the skin is removed, we tie the sheep up between the wooden posts using rope. The flayed beast dangles with its headless stump pointing towards the ground.

Grandmother then begins butchering.

After making a cut near the abdomen, “Look yaj!” She held a slimy red ruby. She put it in my hands for inspection, but I quickly let the underdeveloped baby fall to the dirt. She gleefully yells, “Looks like she was pregnant!”

Yeah, no shit, I thought.

The other sheep are still wailing. “Are we gonna cook them too?” I ask. 

“Yes! We have a lot of company coming over! Yaj, pick up that head and toss it on the grill, would ya?”

I pick the head up from the dirt, lifting it by its long blonde hair. I set it carefully on the grill and watch it blacken from the flames. The smell of burned hair soon stings my nostrils. The blue eyes stare lifelessly back at me – my grandmother will probably eat those, she says the eyes are the best part. 

I bet the American family lying in the corral atop their beds of shit, waiting for death, did not foresee their thanksgiving ending this way. 

“We are not American,” my grandmother lectured me earlier. “Us natives were here before them! And to this day, they still celebrate our genocide! They know, but still they follow their traditions, like sheep, they follow stubbornly. But tonight, grandson, we will celebrate their genocide.”

Like I said, we don't eat turkey for thanksgiving."

A haggard looking man puffed and panted up to the inn coughing. He wheezed as the patrons came outside to see what had frightened him. Between heavy coughs, the man told of how a black dragon attacked his town, eating people like livestock and setting it ablaze. He had barely escaped with his life. Furiously, he demanded the town’s militia be sent to destroy the dreaded beast. The patrons could see smoke in the distance, with its source a reddish glow. They shared the pain and anger of the coughing man.

“End that hellkite’s reign of terror!” barked the man. “Before it flees and takes more lives!”

After a short deliberation, the town came together to arm their soldiers. They cheered and prayed as the men left one by one on steeled horses. They shouted,

“Kill the beast!”

“Bring back its disgusting head and wings!”

“Destroy that devil!” 

“Let it torment us no longer!”

As the cheering died down and the last of the soldiers left, the townsfolk retreated into their homes to await the return of their loved ones. The town plaza soon became empty besides one man.

That old haggard man stood alone out there. His gaze was transfixed on a torch that sat outside the blacksmith’s shop. The torch’s glow looking so pure, so uncontainable, so desiring to be let free.

With a smile the wheezing arsonist took hold of the torch and said to himself, “why, there won’t be a dragon, but there will certainly be a fire.”"

But as it sometimes goes, the experiments went wrong one day.

It was a normal day, at least to Jared, and everything was going fine, and it seemed like another day of easy money.

""Oh, that's locked."" The thing responded, ""I thought of a great play to show you before you play, I'll be starring as the killer, and you? The victim."" It stared at Jared with those eyes it had, and smiled.

""Not if I have anything to do about it!"" Jared shouted, as he ran over to the thing and tried bashing it's skull in. But the thing ducked, and then put it's fist through Jared's chest.

""You know, you won't be the last, First your coworkers, then I might take a break, before heading off to your county, then state, than maybe jump to your continent if I'm feeling spicy."" It grinned at Jared, before walking off, and appeared to teleport away. And the thing didn't lie, it started it's rampage throughout the world.

It hadn’t fit. No matter which angle she tried, no matter how much force Druscilla had exerted. It hadn’t fit.

Mother, thinking quickly, had excused them to the kitchen. “She’s had a salty breakfast,” Mother explained. “Salt swells the extremities. Allow her a minute to rehydrate.”

Their guests had graciously capitulated to the request, despite the absurdity of the idea.

But when Druscilla reached for a mug from the cupboard, Mother had slapped her hand away.

“No amount of water will shrink your fat heifer feet, Druscilla,” Mother had cursed.

Druscilla stared at her blankly. Then Mother had explained her true plan.

“Please Mother,” Druscilla begged, pinned down in the corner of the kitchen. “There will be other suitors!”

“This isn’t just any suitor,” said Mother, pressing the steak knife down at the knuckle of each of Druscilla’s toes, dislodging them, one by one, with a wet pop.

“Darling, hush,” Mother said, clasping her hand over Druscilla’s howling mouth. “His servants will carry you about in sedan chairs. You won’t need to walk once you marry the Prince.”"

“ARE YOU AN IDIOT?” 

It wasn’t a question, more of a statement of fact really. He shook his head and took my shoulders, “There was a herd of deer, what did you want me to do?”

I shoved his hands off of me and glared at our open trunk. At the luggage and at the platter of meat we’d marinated so dutifully, stashed with care, and triple wrapped for safety. It was lying on the ground, the wrap torn to shreds. Some kind of animal had gotten to it before we could wake up.

“We’re lucky it didn’t get to us,” he clenched his teeth, looking away from the crumpled hood of the car, the open trunk, our strewn belongings.

I, both defeated and tired, sat back down on the driver’s side, letting my head rest against the steering wheel. “What the hell are we going to tell them? It was the first time Mom left me in charge of such a big thing for Thanksgiving and we screw it up like this. We won’t have anything to eat except for sides.”

He cleared his throat, “Correction, baby. You. You screwed it up.”

I lifted my head slowly and narrowed my eyes at him, “Is that so…?” 

He shrugged, exasperated and clearly used to my antics. He took my phone from me and dialed my parents. I slumped back into the seat, irritated with him, but not willing to push the conversation further. It was bad enough as it was.

Then, as he brought the phone to his ear, we heard it, an engine right down the route, heading steadily in our direction. Slowly but surely making its way past where we’re stranded. We lock eyes and he terminates the call before it ever even begins. He grabs my hand and I let him lead the way to the edge of the road. As we walk there, I begrudgingly put my arm around his waist, I had definitely overreacted.

He gives me a small kiss as we stand there, waiting for the headlights in the distance to get bigger and brighter, and I return the favor with a tiny peck. “I’m sorry I was out of line.” I gaze up at him and pout.

He nods and gives me a half-smile then turns to start flagging the yellow Jeep down, not wanting to risk letting it slip right past us. It begins to slow and I catch a glimpse at what’s in the front seat.

I hurriedly tug at my boyfriend's shirt and he sends a questioning glance back. “We really should call my parents.” I point at his phone with a trembling finger just as the Jeep rolls its window all the way down. “Tell them we’ll have enough for seconds.” I whisper, as two faces appear, peering out at us.

“How can we help you, Miss?”"
e1lm9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e1lm9n/time_traveling_on_a_budget/,Time Traveling on a Budget,41,4,1574711787.0,"Dave possessed zero desire to spend thousands just to go back in time. Similarly, he was even more resentful of the price the company had put on seeing the future (a whopping 30,000 USD for one five minute trip). Still, many around him clamored for the technology like mosquitos to the flame of trans-humanism. From their view, humanity was no longer burdened by such a fickle thing as time. 

So with a quick search on his implant, he found a cheaper alternative that he could use. 

Ultimately he had spent five hundred dollars for the entire machine that unnaturally stood at the center of his ramshackle garage. 

The catch? The trip in either direction of time would burn out upon the travelers return and the user would have no control of just how far they would go. Some reported going only five minutes into the past and others ten years into the future. 

Dave didn’t care, he just wanted to see it all for himself and not burn through his life savings. As it powered on, Dave thought about what he might see in the future. 

In a brilliant flash of light, he emerged, his garage barely standing. As he emerged, a maelstrom of heat greeted him and he saw titans of organic mass flaying human figures in the distance. He checked his implant for the date so he could know how far into the future he had gone, but couldn’t comprehend the answer. 

100 years. 

Nearby he heard something scuttle amongst the ruined houses, their distinct nano-machine built shells covered in demonic moss. Dave ran, and continued to run until he felt a sharp pain shoot up from his leg. Distracted by various sights and corrupted holograms flickering around him, he failed to notice the trap as thousands of barbs filled him with a strong paralytic agent. 

It had been three minutes. 

Wiry demons devoid of the size and sentience of the ones he had seen in the distance drew closer, their forms warping in and out of the material world with hunger. 

Dave could no longer move. 

By then, they were on him. 

Tearing. 

Slicing. 

Eating. 

At around five minutes, chunks of human flesh returned to the present unable to speak of the horror from where it came. 

Government agents burned down Dave’s house moments later chalking up the cause of death as “Time traveling on a budget.”"

“Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.” He maliciously whispered, he found the whole situation amusing. Taking a person life became a trivial matter.

Twenty-one and in college now. Feel drawn back to the old house. No one claimed it ever since I left. Too many memories, not just my own. Three generations have lived within these walls. You can’t go back home, but here I am. 

It’s been months, living out of boxes. 

I took to sleeping in Gran’s room. I found an old perfume bottle of hers. It’s as if she’s still here with me. She wasn’t just Grandma, but a mom, even first friend. It felt like losing three people all at once.


One night, laying in bed, I just couldn’t get to sleep. Gran sometimes would read me to sleep. I found a book on the shelf in the closet. 

Inside; pages of hand-written passages. Gran’s handwriting. 

Creaking of the floorboards in the hall. One thing I forgot, the odd sounds I’d hear laying in bed at night. “It’s just the old house settling.” Gran had said. When Grandpa passed, I would hear noises all the time during the night. Gran told me too often “Only sounds and sounds can’t hurt you.” 

The door opens, the sound of feet shuffling toward me. “This can’t be real.” I think to myself. The book is pulled away, opens to a photo of a baby. My name is underneath the photo?

The worst pain, something burrowing around inside my head. I must’ve blacked out. Flashes of a nightmare. Gran with a dagger across the flesh of her palm. I scream, I hear only the cries of a baby. I can taste it...blood. “Blood bound, protected shall be, until it time for thee to replenish!” Gran shouts. Blood seeps from her wound down into my mouth.

The sound of birds singing outside my window. Morning. The book lays open. I notice a scar on my palm. I see the same dagger in my dream on the bed. The tip in blood. 


I feel a strong connection to the book. I’m confused. Am I going mad?
The moon is full & bright tonight. I stand in the  backyard. The leaves dance around me. I feel weak, dropping to my knees to bury the book in its earthly tomb. Wheezing; throat so dry. Collapse onto back, body aches and stiffens. Want to scream, feels like something choking me from the inside out. Burst of tears as I can taste it...dirt!"

First, she seduced my good Christian son. He was a virgin when they met and now he isn’t! He told me they laid when he was a freshman in college.  A FRESHMAN! He was just a child waiting for marriage like any good son would do.

Next, she pulled him away from his faith. He was raised in our religion and this harlot comes around and thinks she can just decide to make him convert to her bottom-feeder religion?! I don’t think so.

Then, he decides to marry the witch. She doesn’t want a religious ceremony in a church, oh no, it has to be a courthouse wedding and I wasn’t even invited! They think that they’re married. I’ll let them believe that they are, let them keep playing house. They didn’t marry in front of God and family so their marriage isn’t real!

After they got ""married"", my son moved out of my house. The house that he was raised in! He left behind all seven of his younger brothers and sisters, without even saying goodbye, and ran off in the night. Only heathens gallivant around at that time. It pains me to say this, but I think my son is turning into a demon.

Then the whore gets knocked up, with not one baby but two. Of course I am banned from the delivery room. The little slut wouldn’t let me watch my first grandchildren be born because, and I quote, “We don’t want any visitors and just want to spend time getting to know the babies.” Well newsflash, BITCH, I AM FAMILY! My son threw a temper tantrum when I came by for a visit and took MY GRANDCHILDREN with me to  another family members house that they haven’t met yet. He was upset because I didn’t tell them that I was taking the twins. I am his MOTHER. I do NOT have to tell ANYONE what I do or do not do with my babies.

Anyway, I’m telling you all of this because my son has kicked me and his actual family from his life. He has blocked my phone number, blocked me on social media, and moved away. Can you believe that? A son abandoning his family for a scandalous woman who was born out of wedlock?! 

What he doesn’t know is that I know where they moved to. They now live about a two-hour drive from me. Tonight, after the “family” is asleep, I’m going to take the twins on a little stroll to teach my son what it is like to lose your own child. They’re better off anyway.

There are no holidays left.

Not for me at least. People on the outside still celebrate holidays like always. I’m not allowed that privilege. Well, as a death row inmate in 2070 I don’t have  a lot of privileges and the lack of holidays is the last thing on my mind. 

One holiday stuck though. Thanksgiving.

First I should explain how death row works. Inmates have white, thin devices around their necks at all times. At any minute of any day the device could go off and inject us with a poison that kills us in seconds. Every day we wake up wondering if we ever go to sleep again and every conversation could be our last. The devices go off randomly. If you’re violent, chances are you won’t last long. But some people have been here years, just waiting.

You might think that’s cruel. First, it is. But when you think about it, you have the same chances of dying in the middle of a peaceful day. Just like us.

Thanksgiving is the only day in the year where the devices are turned off. One day without the constant, looming anxiety, when you can enjoy things, knowing you will live to see another day. It’s a chance for us to be grateful for our short, remaining life. 

We aren’t invincible, of course. If we act up, guards can just simply say a code word and we would be dead in 5 seconds. Them noticing could take another five seconds, so ten.

Luckily, ten seconds is all I need.

You are probably wondering what my crime was. I’m accused of killing my mother. I didn’t. And the only thing worse than an innocent man in death row is a guilty one walking free.

Thanksgiving day comes. There’s finally some edible food, families are allowed to visit and we can roam free around the facility. Some poor bastard even taped turkeys on the grey walls to make the place feel a little nicer. Weirdly hopeful for a death trap. 

I walk on the hallway. Cameras stare at me at every corner. I hid the shiv in my sleeve. It took me weeks to get it and if someone would notice it, I would be dead. I try to look amused, like I enjoy the turkey pictures and the awful music. The hallway is almost empty. It’s just me and him.

He turns around to face me just as I plunge the shiv to his throat. His mouth opens and before he could speak, the shiv sinks into my father.

There’s no way I’m surviving this. Like they’d let me go after killing a guard.

“This for mom, asshole”, I whisper. My father’s mouth moves and a single word comes out. The device beeps and a lethal injection starts moving into my bloodstream.

I fall to the ground, next to my dad. We both gasp for air as the alarms scream around us.

You’re supposed to spend Thanksgiving with family, after all."

 “You know your mom better than I do. Which would she prefer?”

Again I am met with no response. It’s not like I expected an answer, but it would have been nice. She can’t hear me, and even if she could she wouldn’t. She was such a bitch like that. It irritates me all over again. I set my hand on the cool metal handle to calm my heated blood. 

“Maybe I’ll just go with Mrs. Allen.”

The only sound I hear is a slight ringing, but the silence of her voice is nice for once. There is no arguing. It’s wonderful. I hope Ms. Allen appreciates silence too.

He carried a brief case that he claimed was filled with people's hopes and dreams. The magician was a tall man wearing bizarre, yet exquisite clothes. People found themselves mesmerized by the stranger for reasons they didn't understand at the time. He charmed the crowds with his many otherworldly tricks such as conjuring daisies out of thin air. He set up shop in the town afterward.

""Come one and all for a special one-chance opportunity. For a certain fee, you'll get what you want."" 

His first customer was a single woman who was blind from birth. She always spent her life imagining sights in her mind. She received her sight a few days later, and was delighted for a good while. But then came the ugly truth. Pus-filled boils were all over her body somehow manifesting in the night. The skin around her face sagged giving her a permanent frown. A hunchback formed on her back, her fingernails grew long and gnarled. She hid herself in her home to hide her shame.

Another was a man who had a talkative child that brought unwanted attention to himself. The magician worked his magic, and it worked. Without a tongue, the boy permanently kept to himself and was never a bother again.  The father would forever be tormented by his decision.

A working mom asked the magician for a vacation to a place far away. She disappeared without a trace.  Soon after her, the people of the town became ensnared by the magician's promises. The town was washed in chaos with the residents' wishes being fulfilled at drastic costs. People coveted their neighbor's possessions. Some found themselves further looking up towards the magician with new additions to their demands. They became like rabid animals biting and assaulting each other to get the magician's attention.  He gave them markings of his symbol to act as payments for his services. Eventually it seemed as though time itself halted with some citizens claiming to have the markings all over their bodies. 

The oddest thing, however, is the magician remained the same age while the others around him were reduced to dust."

Back in college, my friends and I were going to the outlets. It was a full car, 5 guys, and were blasting music, just having an all around good time. I’m known to speed from time to time and that day I remember going around 90mph. There was a car in front of me and I was gaining on it fast. I was going to switch to the left most lane (US so it’s the fastest lane), but there was a yellow sports car there. Me, being the idiot that I am, decided the best idea was to speed up and get in front of it, but as I sped up, so did the sports car a bit. Well I was getting way to close to the car in front of me so figuring I had JUST enough room to cut in front of the sports car, I did. I must’ve been going at least 100mph. Anyway, I remember my friend screamed and then we were fine... I looked in my rear view mirror wondering where the sports car was and it was gone? It wasn’t on the road anymore. It couldn’t have exited since exits are on the rightmost lane.

I always wonder if a version of me died that day. Me in a different timeline. I must’ve caused a lot of pain to a lot of people that day and I always feel terrible thinking about the possible sadness I caused. Safe to say, I’m a lot more careful about driving."

The bedroom is relatively small so no matter how the furniture is arranged, I can see myself in the reflection when I'm lying in bed. It was a little unnerving at first, but after living here for several months I don't even think twice about it. 

A few weeks ago I noticed that my dog likes to admire himself in the mirror. I was having some trouble sleeping and was awake much later than usual, reading scary stories online when around 3:30 AM my dog woke from a dead sleep to sit in front of the closet and stare at his reflection. I chuckled at his adorableness and snapped a picture with my phone. He admired his handsome self for about 10 minutes and then climbed back into bed and went right back to sleep. 

About a week and a half later I was battling insomnia again and noticed that my dog gets out of bed every night to sit in front of the mirror and stare at himself. The time varies a little bit every night but it's usually for about 10 minutes sometime between 3:15 and 3:45. After his staring session is over he hopes back into bed with me and falls right back to sleep. I figured he must be getting a little OCD or something in his old age, he is officially a senior dog after all.

Last night I was home alone though. I was out of town for a few days and my dog was staying at the kennel, my flight got in too late to pick him up before they closed so now I have to wait until tomorrow to get him back. I'm staying in a hotel until I can bring him home. 

Last night I was awake in the middle of the night yet again, the house just feels so empty without my dog here. Right around the time he normally stares at himself in the mirror I glanced over at the closet, missing my boy's silly antics, and froze. Staring at me from the mirror was a big black dog with fiery red eyes. His lips were curled back in a silent snarl and foam dripped from his fangs. 

I turned on my bedroom light and the dog was still there. I wasn't sure if he was able to come out of the mirror and I wasn't going to stick around and find out. I leapt out of bed and ran, slamming the bedroom door behind me, and bolted out of house. 

Now I realize my dog wasn't admiring himself, but fending off...something. I have someone coming by tomorrow to replace the closet doors with wooden sliders but as I lay here in my hotel room staring at the large mirror along the wall, I'm terrified to fall asleep."

""It's in there."" Alice murmured.

I looked down, and saw shadows roll. It was black, inky, melting into the shadows. It moved as part of them.

 Eyes glowed back at us. It was the size of a jaguar, and walked like one too. It was growling, like a purr, smooth and seductive. A spiked and long tail whipped around seductively. It's teeth were white, long and sharp stucking out like tusks in front of it's face. 

""What is it?""

""I'm not sure, but I'm calling it a Skygge.""

""It's not natural, it can't be real.""

""No, but here it is, beautiful huh?""

""It's horrifying. We have to tell Dad we found it here.""

She turned to me. ""We can't! Dad will kill him if we know he exists!""

""He wouldn't kill his experiment.""

""He would. Anyway I trust him. He's singing to me."" The hairs on my neck bristled. I looked past the movements and noticed chunks of bloody flesh and tawny fur.

""Alice, it ate our cat.""

""He was hungry.""

I looked at her, searching for something that was missing in her eyes. They were cold and dark. Wrong.

""This isn't right."" I said.

""We can't tell Dad.""

I nodded and looked down at it, and it stared at me hungrily.

""It doesn't like you.""

""I can't think of a way to help that Alice.""

""I can.""

I turned to her, her voice had taken a hard edge.She had a grimace on her face, eyes cold. She ran at me with a battle cry, her full force slamming into me and sending me flailing to the basement floor. 

Hard, cold concrete greeted me. Gasping, I sat up and whirled around, following the moving shadow. My body burned as I stumbled to the stairs. Then a piercing pain in my calf appeared. Laughter appeared from above as my leg was ripped off. I screamed as it bit my back, with a couple rips and cracks it took my arm.

Darkness pooled into my eyes, sleep flowing through my empty veins. The noises of it eating my body faded as Alice walked away.

None of that mattered though. A lullaby so sweet filled my ears. Sung with a pain so rich I could taste it. No noise could compare to the song that rolled through the room. My Skygge sang as it went for my head."

He had led the rats into the river near the town with his magic pipe, drowning every single one of them.

When the people of the town refused to pay him the simple played another song on his pipe and led all the children of the town into the river.

As the parents cried and screamed he did not feel anything, this was not justice, nor payback.

It was just a price.

When the final child stopped breathing he turned to leave.

But before he could go his own way he was faced with the angry citizens of Hamelin.

“Bring them back!” They screamed, or cried, “BRING THEM BACK!”

They began punching him while they kept screaming for their lost children.

Couldn’t they just drag their bodies out of the river?

“Fine,” he yelled.

The Pied Piper put on his pipe, he began playing a song he never played before.

The crowd  stopped and went silent.

A sinister song began to play and for a few seconds even the wind stopped rustling.

A second later two children emerged from the water.

“Motherrrrrr….” The voice was hoarse but distinctly female.

“Heeeelllppp ussss…” a boyish voice dragged out.

Two children stumbled towards the crowd.

The woman who kept nagging him charged forward towards the children, probably hers.

Tears of joy ran over her face, disbelieving the wonder as she hugged her two children.

Another citizens of Hamelin stepped towards the river, looking out for his child.

More figures emerged from the water as the song kept playing.

“Papaaaaa!” one of the children cries out the moment his dad embraces him in his warm hug.

The girl that emerged first from the river turned to face her mother, “Mooootttheerr…” she cries out, her pitch black eyes staring at her mother.

She grabbed her mother’s arm and bit.

The boy leaped forward and dug his teeth into the woman’s neck, the woman fell on her back and the two children took full advantage of that.

They slowly ripped off her clothes and began chewing on her soft flesh.

All around the river the children began to stumble towards the adults, some of the children who were already embraced began tearing of the flesh from their parents.

That was the moment the living began to run from the death.

One of them tried to drag along the body of his dead wife, but before he could do it the woman rose to her feet, dropping the two children of her and turned towards her husband.

Dead eyes stared at him as she moaned, “Myyyy Loveeeeeee…”

As the dead slowly approached hamelin the Pied Piper couldn’t feel anything.

He did not feel satisfaction or disgust.

As the drowned children cried while they marched towards the town, followed by their fallen parents he did not feel anything, this was not justice, nor payback.

It was just a price."

Her brother, Morgan, was snoring loudly on the other side of their room next to his friend, but she was filled with unease, trying to find her traveler's pack which she was sure she brought with her into the room. All that remained from it was her brush, which she had taken out last night while falling asleep. She's sure she locked the entrance door, and her brother wouldn't have touched it, she must have just misplaced it, probably in the restroom down the hall from her room.

Gwen couldn't tell the exact time of night it was, but it was unlikely that it was close to dawn, and certainly not before midnight. She drew a deep breath. 

*Avert your eyes. Don't look into any mirrors.* She repeated this to herself inside her head.

*Remember what Mother said. Keep your eyes down and follow the geometry of the floor.*

The hallway mirrors were pretty in the daylight, but likely not blessed. Her reflection showed her disheveled state, messy black hair and sleep-deprived red eyes, though she didn't dare look. 

She knew there was a presence there with her.

She pushed open the door and walked to where she placed her bag, careful not to look at the large mirror hanging above the sink. 

Memories flashed through her mind of when she first became an apprentice for her mother, and all the stories she would hear. They kept a single, blessed silver mirror in their home. Since everything that's happened to her, she misses those days. 

*Don't look into the dark. Keep your eyes shut if you have to.*

She retreated to her room, her eyes shut as she traced her hand on the hallway's wall for guidance. 

Entering her room, she passed the two boys at the entrance and climbed into her bed at the end of the room. Facing the wall while lying down, she reached into her bag and took out a small piece of medicine her maven gave her and began to brush her hair again to help herself fall asleep, running the brush through her short, brown hair in slow and gentle motions, again and again. Eventually, she grew tired.

As she was drifting off to sleep, she heard Morgan's voice at her side, speaking to her in a hushed tone, against the ambiance of their snoring. She kept her eyes shut, still facing the wall her bed was up against and answered the question they had asked. 

They kept asking her questions, and the more they talked the more the advice her mother gave her weighed on her mind. She said they'd talk in the morning, and nothing more. The questions stopped. The shadowy figure stood over her for what seemed like hours, doing nothing but watch her. She could hear its breathing in her ear. 

She didn't get any sleep that night, but she never once opened her eyes."
e0yvyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e0yvyy/transmission/,Transmission,15,2,1574604287.0,"Oct 20: It’s back again. I started this journal because I know I’m not imagining it—the sound is real. It started about a week and a half ago, and at first was nothing more than a faint ringing. But now it’s not so faint anymore. It’s blaring: every day, at 4 o’clock sharp, it starts, and continues uninterrupted for the next 30 minutes. It’s driving me crazy.

Oct 24: The noise is almost deafening now. Before it was annoying, but tolerable. But today I honestly thought I was going to throw up: I couldn’t think or move or do anything until it stopped. I’m surprised my ears weren’t bleeding after. Even listening to music doesn’t help.

Oct 26: There’s a black van parked at the end of my street that shows up every day at 3:45. It can’t be a coincidence. The van pulls up, then fifteen minutes later I’m crying in my room from the pain, and by the time it’s done I look out my window and the van’s gone. I have to get to the bottom of this...I can’t continue to live like this.

Oct 28: I’m afraid to go outside. Yesterday I hid in Mrs. Robertson’s bushes and waited. Sure enough, the van pulled up and sat idling, windows tinted. I noticed there was something that looked like an antenna perched on the back, larger than necessary for radio transmissions. Furious, I sprinted up and tried to bang on the doors, get some answers. Before I got two feet, though, the noise started—louder than ever before—and I actually blacked out from the pain. By the time I woke up, the van was gone, and there was a small circle of concerned neighbors around me. I ignored them and rushed to my house, locking the door behind me. Whatever’s going on, it’s clear it isn’t safe to be outside.

Oct 31: I know what I have to do. The van came back the past couple days, along with the noise. It’s clear whoever’s inside is responsible for what’s happening to me, but as to why I have no idea. There’s no license plate to run, and my last physical run in has made me wary of another confrontation. It doesn’t matter, though: I think I’ve finally discovered their source. From my research online (all done on an onion router with a VPN, though even then I doubt what I’m looking at is private), it’s clear that an auditory disruptor has been placed inside my head. Functioning the same way as an external cochlear implant might, the device inside me is sending transmissions directly to my brain...for what purpose, I don’t want to guess. What I do know is I have to get it out. I’m currently sitting in my bathroom with YouTube playing in front of me, a power drill by the sink. In case I’m unsuccessful, whoever finds this needs to spread my story. They’re real, they’re out there, and they want in your head..."

I listen again 

...

There is nothing here nothing at all that makes a sound I’ve tried everything but not even I can speak, please help... 

Let me start from the beginning...

I was visiting my Mam who lived in Wrexham in Wales, I was turning 21 the day I visited but once I got there I heard nothing, cars were still parked but I could neither see nor hear anyone, so I walked up the stone steps up into the house.

“Mam?”...” Pa?”...”Levi?”

“...”

Nothing, NOTHING.

I called again

“MAM? PA? LEVI?”

“...” 

So I go and I check the house, 

Kitchen: nothing

Bathroom: Nothing

Living room: nothing

Dining room: nothing

Bedrooms: nothing 

Nobody’s here?

So I get back in my car and drive back down the street but I can’t get out of the street, it’s almost like a unknown force is holding me back.

It’s been 7 weeks and still nobody’s here, I’ve checked everywhere but the old butchers shop...

There’s everyone! Right where I didn’t check... 

How could I forget where I hid the bodies?"

He could feel the urge of a chill rising up his spine. Mustering all the self-control he could, he raised his weapon, pressed it firmly upon his cheek, exhaled slowly and squeezed the trigger. His shotgun let out a BOOM! that tore through the surrounding woods. A stifled gobble echoed through the orange and magenta trees followed by an abrupt and immediate silence.

Thanksgiving Day...

Clearing her throat with a healthy gulp of sweet tea, she exclaimed, ""Now Mitchell, that was the best turkey I've ever had!"" ""Mother,"" Mitch replied with a curt nod. ""Glad to see Pappy's ol' 12 gauge is still a mean ol' bitch,"" dad said poudly. ""She sure is,"" Mitch replied with a curious grin. By that time, the nephews and nieces had scurried off to the backyard to play in the crinkly leaves and the in-laws had relocated to the living room to watch the big game. ""I'm so sorry Lydia couldn't be here today, Mitchell,"" mother said wistfully. ""Me too. Work came up. Unavoidable, I'm afraid,"" Mitch explained plainly. ""I'm sorry, dear, "" she offered and excused herself to the bathroom. ""I'll come back with the ice cream.""

Mitch and dad retired to the back porch where dad lit up his pipe and Mitch got lost in a day dream. All of a sudden, he shook his head and regained consciousness, startled by a shrill cry from inside. Before dad or the children had a chance to stop and worry, Mitch grabbed the porch door handle and started hastily back inside shouting behind him, ""Don't worry, I'm sure everything's fine!"" As he passed the living room, the in-laws pointed to the bathroom without looking up, too afraid to miss the big play.

Making his way to the bathroom to check on mother, he stopped in his tracks as he passed the open door that led to the garage. ""That's not right,"" he thought to himself. He then realized that's where the scream had come from and felt a deep pit in his stomach. ""How could I be so careless?""

There was mother, standing frozen in shock over the meat freezer, hand still propping open the lid. ""Lydia...sweet Lydia,"" she sobbed. Lydia stared back up at mother, her eyes a lifeless crystal blue, her skin black and frost bitten. ""You're not going to find any ice cream in there"" Mitch said regretfully as he walked slowly toward her, her back still turned. ""I am sorry,"" he said as he felt her delicate neck tensing between his constricting hands. There was that familiar chill rising up his spine again. He closed his eyes and bit his lip. And then a loud BANG! His grip loosened and he gasped for air. He slowly turned, confused to see dad standing there with the mean ol' bitch still smoking in his hands. Mitch closed his eyes again...for the last time."

I dressed in a cashmere sweater. My mother bought it for me. I wear it so she won't be disappointed. She is never happy with my wardrobe if she didn't pick it out. She'll always find something about my appearance. Frizzy hair, unmatching socks, I don't smile enough. 

My mother is waiting for me. 

""Happy thanksgiving!"" I say.

Her face remains expressionless. I give her a hug, and she's a bit cold, just like her personality. Her eyes stare at me. I know exactly what she's looking at. I touch my face self consciously. I didn't put on makeup, and my freckles are visible. I told her they were angel kisses, and she laughed at me. 

""No, honey,"" she said in the sweetest voice. ""They are ugly. It's what ugly girls tell themselves.""

I can feel her disappointment. I should have covered them.

""Go talk to your father,"" she tells me now. ""I'll get you foundation.""

I walk into my father's study. He is reading a book, but he looks tired. Probably from my mom controlling him. I walk back out. I would rather see my brother. 

My brother's room is small, but I fit in just fine. He has shiny blonde hair like spun gold, baby blue eyes, and a bit chubby like a two year old should be. He doesn't have any freckles. I hate him for that, for being everything I'm not. I don't fault him for it. 

I pull out the blue ribbon in my pocket. I wore it the last thanksgiving I lived in this house. I carry it to stay strong. My mother told me the color didn't match my complexion, and I should burn it. Instead, I made a blue choker to match it. 

I make my way over to my brother. I remember that thanksgiving clearly. He wears the pretty blue choker I made to matches his blue eyes, and soft blue lips. Ah, what a pity my mom can't see her perfect son now. 

I crawl closer to him, and I get a bit of dirt on my cashmere. Small price to pay for visiting. This is my mom's punishment. She took my happiness, so I took something she loved even more. 

""Happy Thanksgiving,"" I whisper to him.

I tie the ribbon in my hair, and crawl back out from under the house. I dust off, and go inside. They are sitting at the table already. She notices the ribbon, and smudges of dirt. Her lips twist with disgust. It doesn't bother me like usual. I sit down, and serve myself some turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. 

I will suffer every time I have to see her. It's unavoidable. I will suffer a couple times a year, but she will suffer for the rest of her life. She will never know what happened to her little boy. That's truly beautiful. It's enough to make a girl smile. "

With some time left before I leave, I boot up my game.
My mom leans in to see me play, says, ""That'll make you violent.""
I roll my eyes and she moves on, cursing out my name.

I've come to school, I'm doing work. The teacher asks our hobbies.
She gets to me and I tell her I play games about old wars.
She looks offended, calls me out, says, ""You're gonna become violent"".
The day moves on, the day soon ends, I enter my home door.

My dad is sprawled across his chair, his eyes fixed on the screen.
Remote control in his left hand, a beer can in his right.
I tell him I've returned, to hear him scoff as a reply.
""Go and play your violent games. I know you *love* to fight.""

It's almost night and mom pulls in, she's finally off work.
A couple seconds pass until I hear her slam the door.
I peer into the kitchen where I hear the two start screaming.
And it isn't any longer until dad has mom pushed to the floor.

Vanities are thrown about, they call each other names.
Mom tries to flee - fed up with dad -she wants to be alone.
But dad is angry, drunk and loud, he wants to hurt her more.
I close my eyes and pray as he breaks another bone.

It's 12 at night and I decide to finally make my move.
Advance across the living room where mom rests on the couch.
I creep into my parents room and open up the closet.
I see the safe shoved in the corner, and reach to pull it out.

Enclosed, i know whats in this box. I know what it can do.
""For self defense"" I remember, the reason it was bought.
I glance, behind my shoulder, to the bed where my dad lay.
And start to press the numbers on the untouched, hardened box.

I start to think, the numbers, then the answer comes to mind.
I mash the zero, then the four
I dial eight, then three.
I hear the beep, the mechanism lets the safe be breached.
And creaking the box open reveals
A weapon in front of me.

I grab the gun, I close the box, I turn back to the bed.
Where my father gently rests. So peaceful and so silent.
I approach him as my arm gravitates to his head.

I whisper, *Video games don't make me violent*"

Right above the airspeed indicator, he has a photo of her. He looks at it and knows he must find her. He begins scanning the area again. A voice comes on over his headset.

“Where the hell are you? You better not be out look-“ he turns off the headset.

Hours go by. The sun is getting low in the sky. He knows it won’t be much longer before he won’t see anything in the trees below. Another disappointing day.

He’s turns the aircraft to head back when he catches something. A flash, like someone took a picture. It happened so quickly that he’s not even sure it happened. He circles the aircraft around again looking down at the clearing. There it was again.

Should he call it in? He stares at the picture of her and then back at the clearing. He knows what he must do.

He prepares the craft to land. He lines up with the clearing. It’ll be a tight landing but he’s an expert. He makes his approach and slows the plane down. It’s bumpy ground and some branches scratch the wings but he lands successfully.

He tosses his headset off, grabs her picture and exits the plane. As he looks about the clearing, he hears rustling from behind him. He quickly turns but it’s too late. Something hits him and he’s knocked out.

He awakes hours later when it’s dark. His arms and legs are tied as he sits by a fire. A stranger in tattered clothes is whittling a spear with a knife across the fire pit. The man’s head is hurting and he leans his head back, closing his eyes.

“You’re awake,” the stranger says without looking. “I thought I killed you with that blow to the head.”

“Looking...for...,” the man begins but finds it hard to concentrate. The stranger doesn’t seem to be listening.
 
“Glad you saw my signal with the mirror, I’ve been stranded since our small plane went down.” The stranger admires his spear. “I’ve been hunting for so long.”

The man opens his eyes, finally able to think clearly. “Plane? Did it have a lady? Is she…”

The stranger pulls out the picture of her from his pocket. He looks at it and throws it in the fire.

“She’s gone,” the stranger says.

“No no no!” He fights the rope around his hands as he looks frantically around the fire. Out of the corner of his eye he sees a pile of bones. And some skulls.

“I’ve did what I had to do to survive,” the stranger says as he walks over. In a quick motion, he stabs the man in the gut with the spear. “The only problem is, when you taste fresh cooked meat, it’s all you can think about eating.”"

They knew you were there from a yard away. Their perception is amazing. Far beyond ours, and it makes me think... How much do we miss? Do they sense things we don't when they stare into empty corners and growl at the end of a hallway? Even if we do sense things, most of the time we ignore it or blame something easy. We've been tuned to rationalize everything. How would we know the difference between benign and sinister? How. Much. Have we missed? 

You wait for the big noise to go investigate. You aren't gonna go investigate the slightest creak. But it's the creaks that are worse. That just means they're better at hiding.

5... 4... 3... 2... 1.

""Good afternoon,"" he said into the cold, all-seeing eye of the camera. ""I have called this press conference to address the recent rumours that have been circulating about me in the press.""

A few metres away, his wife, Gwen, stood pale-faced and tight-lipped. 

""Those rumours concern my Chief of Staff, Amanda Fung. As always, I will speak honestly and plainly. For the past few months I have been engaged in an extra-marital affair with Ms Fung. In doing this, I have fallen short of the high, personal standard of conduct that I have set for myself, and is expected by the good people of Robina. I have let down myself, but more importantly, my wife, my family, and the citizens of this town. I ask that my family and I are given space and privacy to work through this matter. I have no comments on my future as Mayor nor will I be taking any questions at this time. Thank you.""

&#x200B;

That night, Elvis sat at the dinner table with his son. Gwen was on the phone in another room. 

Elvis junior pushed his asparagus around his plate. ""Daddy, will you resign? That's what the newsman said you'll do.""

Elvis hesitated. ""I'm not sure, buddy. We'll see.""

""But if you resign, what will you do?""

""Oh, we'll all move somewhere nice. With lots of green fields and lakes. With plenty of other kids for you to play with."" He gave his son a tired, tight-lipped smile. 

Gwen came back to the table and sat down. ""That was Amanda. She said there's still been no word, but she'll let us know.""

Elvis nodded grimly. Gwen reached over and squeezed his hand. 

Suddenly the landline rang.

Gwen jumped up, but so did Elvis. ""I'll get it!"" he said. He scurried away to answer it. 

""Hello?"" he said into the receiver. 

There was a lengthy silence, before a soft, oily voice spoke. ""I've decided you will continue on as Mayor. And, Elvis - thanks to your little stunt, we will be expediting the schedule and releasing the you-know-what tonight. We have run out of patience with you.""

""Wait -"" said Elvis. But the line went dead. 

Elvis hung up the phone and looked over at his wife. She saw the colour drain from his face.

""Elvis? What's wrong?""

Elvis looked out the window at the small, snow-covered town of Robina in the valley below.

Possibly for the last time."

As I watched myself tear apart another innocent soul, groaning on the outside but screaming on the inside, I realized that the worst part about it was that I was getting used to the gore.

This has been going on for years. I can't close my eyes. I can't look away. And I can't stop it. No matter how hard I try, I can't stop this. My own pain. The pain I cause others. It all hurts the same.

Now I was watching myself consume someone alive. This one was a baby. One that could've had a perfect life if it weren't for me.

I want it to end. I WANT it to end. But I won't. *I* won't stop this. It'll keep going, and it'll keep going, and it'll keep going. And it will be my fault. All of it.

All of it.

This one's shooting at me. The pain as the bullets go through my disfigured body hurts me, but it doesn't hurt me. The pain I feel doesn't stop myself from grabbing the survivor's throat and tearing it open, blood splattering all over both of our clothes.

Everyone sees a monster, and maybe they're right.

But at the same time, they're wrong.

Despite how it seems, we're still who we used to be. But we can't show it. We can never show it.

I walked faster up the stairs, they had two cases, a full and a half, leading to the top..

""CAMILLE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE-""

""Get her some water would you, I'd need some assistance in this.""

""Here Camille dr-,""  he gulped, ""Drink up..""

Am I an idiot? I’d like to think not. Juniper is being held against his will, and It doesn’t take a genius to know theres something obviously wrong with the cup. But I drank it anyway, hoping maybe Juniper will be safe knowing he succeeded.

""It's not...about you, and why would you want to kill him?” I said, my eyes struggling to stay open..

He bent down to me, he changed the tone of his voice, relaxing and southing, he said ""Your heart should only hold a place for me- Not for this, this coward. He didn’t even try to fight me to save you- But I would’ve.”

It’s stifling, the cold. They always said that hell was hot, but this deep sense of chill that permeates my bones feel akin to flames licking at my skin, working it's way in. 

Is this my own personal hell then? All I wanted in life was comfort and warmth. So now I'm doomed to walk eternity in this frozen wasteland. Where did it all go wrong? Or was I wrong?

Question, questions, question, without answers. 

Always alone as I have lived so too shall I in death. I wonder why I expected any different. I used to believe in God. I cried and I prayed for my salvation up to the moment of my death. I tried, oh I tried, so hard to cling to my faith and my belief. 

You know, I still hear my own screams in my head. My pleas for mercy, for forgiveness, for love, scraping my throat raw, and the animalistic sounds I still couldn't believe came from me. 

Now that I'm dead, I realize I never truly felt alive. At least not that I can even remember. I think my heart was born broken and crooked, and remains that way... But that’s not true, I did love once. I loved with all that I was capable, all that I knew how. 

Was it so bad that I wanted the same love in return? She said she loved me, that I was the only one. I didn't believe love could lie. 

So I carved her heart out of her chest to see if it was true. For the first time in my life, I actually FELT warmth; it washed over me, over my hands, over my soul. It was red, who would've known? That warmth came with a color.

I am innocent, I swear it. But the swift hand of justice denied me otherwise. Murder they said. How could they not understand that all I wanted was her love, her heart. 

It's cold, so cold, and once again, I'm so alone. "

She would quote scripture, pray multiple times a day, and she lived her life as the bible dictated. She was very judgmental and hated within our family. So, when Grandma needed to be taken care of, the job fell to my sister and I. Obviously, my sister wasn’t interested, and neither was I. We pooled our cash together and placed her into an affordable care home.

My sister’s involvement was only a monetary one, the actual move into the home was done by my boyfriend and I. My Grandmother was not able to move much, so she was going to be bedridden until she passed. During this time, we took the liberty of sorting through her belongings. We didn’t want to move in a bunch of garbage that we would have to throw out later, so we decided to just do that now. 

My boyfriend, Aron, found my Grandmother’s diary. As he read it, he looked confused. He came to me telling me to read the last few passages. I could see he was lost and could only imagine the horrible things she wrote in this diary. Aron then guided me to a page, it was the 4th last passage in the diary. It read as follows:

“My attempts to guide my Grandchildren to the path of God has failed. They seem content to live in the ways of sin, knowing the consequences. I don’t believe my lord would damn my grandchildren’s souls to hell, I believe the lord accepts everyone into his holy embrace. However, I can’t take the chance that their souls will plummet to the hellfire below. They are such good children. I have spoken with the Archbishops in the Vatican, I have visited Bethlehem, and I have prayed to the lord in Israel. I have spoken to the Lord, and I have been granted the same cursed penance as his own son.”

I looked at Aron, also confused, and wondered what this could possibly mean. I rushed over to the care home to find an ambulance and EMT’s trying to revive my Grandmother. Her Hands and feet were bleeding, and the EMT’s finally gave up trying to revive her shortly after we arrived. Aron held me close. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. With no one to give me answers, I consulted the rest of the diary. Her last passage was short, but it read:

“I can’t believe how foolish I was. How could I possibly believe I would be granted such a request? The great deceiver. He has tricked me. I am sorry to everyone. I am a gullible old fool. When I die, I will gladly seek forgiveness from those who curse my name.”

My phone began to ring, it was my sister. When I answered the phone, she was crying. She said her hands and feet were bleeding. I didn’t understand until I felt the blood run down my own arm."

e0mmku,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e0mmku/footsteps/,‘Footsteps’,10,0,1574536967.0,"Sometimes I hear the chilling sound of footsteps creeping behind me. Even in broad daylight I’ve heard them echoing within the halls and corridors of my domicile. Whenever I turn around to confront my unseen ‘shadow’ though, there is nothing there. I used to think I was merely imagining things, but I’m positive now that some dark and sinister entity is aggressively stalking me. For what reason, I couldn’t hazard a guess. Reasonably, one could assume it has malicious intent. Why else would an unseen being creep around and spook the hell out of me?

At night the footsteps are much louder and more pronounced. I even feel the presence of the faceless soul in the darkness. Anyone else might think I was just hearing the sound of my own feet, but these foreign paces are not in the same cadence as mine. It’s almost as if ‘it’ wants me to realize that I’m being followed. Despite this intimidation, I try to pretend I’m totally undeterred. The sinister ‘cat and mouse game’ could only have one outcome. For that reason my little ‘false calm’ facade is pointless but I do it anyway. We both know I’m not alone.

I’ve asked others present if they heard these looming footfalls but they never do. Obviously my unseen tormenter knows how to avoid detection around other witnesses. I’ve come to realize I’m the sole focus of it’s unwanted attention. I expect a personal attack at some point but I hope I’m wrong about it’s intentions. When you actually feel warm breath radiating on the back of your neck, you tend to assume the worst. 

Some days I pretend it isn’t happening. Others I grow so tired of the persistent ordeal that I turn around to stare down this unseen presence. Neither reaction does any good. It isn’t intimidated by protests or icy stares. In frustration, I started openly yelling yesterday. I shouted and screamed until I was blue in the face but I still felt it lurking nearby. 

Others that witnessed my angry outburst only saw me standing there. They couldn’t see the hidden object of my fury. I’m sure they are worried about my deteriorating mental state but I’m not imagining any of it. The footsteps are real. If only they were privy to the relentless entity that trails along behind me, they’d understand. Until then, I‘ll endeavor to avoid reacting to the incessant and threatening behavior. Ultimately I believe it’s still the best course of action. It doesn’t draw as much attention to myself and I can avoid alarming my fellow spirits. Dwelling within the realm of the dead is incredibly lonely and frustrating. We are haunted by the everyday lives of the living. I’m just more sensitive to them."

The day started like any other, waking up just before dawn to get ready for work and wishing that I could win the lottery. I scrolled through my phone as I drank my coffee, falling down one Reddit rabbit hole after another. 

Suddenly, my phone chirps and alerts me to a missed call followed by the second chirp for a voice mail. Odd. It didn't even ring. I navigated to my voice mailbox and hit play.

""Hello, this message is for Ms. Melody Perez. My name is Gregory Silver, and I am a partner with Kane, Hall, and Silver.  I represent the estate of your late Uncle, Esteban Perez. First, I'd like to express my condolences for your loss. Second, I have excellent news for you. Your Uncle has left you a rather sizable inheritance. Please, feel free to stop by our offices this afternoon so we can iron out all the details.""

I blinked. Then I blinked again. I never even knew that I had an Uncle at all, let alone a rich one. 

The entire day was a blur until I set foot in that office. My brain was buzzing with the excitement of what this could mean for my future. 

It didn't take long to get all the papers signed and the keys to his home.  It was a large six-bedroom victorian near the lake on the edge of town along with a check for millions of dollars. Strangely enough, the inheritance had one requirement. I needed to live in the home for one week to collect. It sounded easy enough.

When I arrived, the first thing I noticed about the house was a large painting hung over the stairway of a man, supposedly my Uncle. On his chest, he had a strange brooch with a curious creature on it. The smell was musty, making me light-headed and sleepy. I laid down for a nap in the upstairs bedroom. 

My dreams were feverish. A creature that looked like some contrived mashup of a large cat and a reptile chased me down to the lake and was drowning me at the water's edge. I fought hard against it, feeling the strain of my fingernails digging into mud and rocks. 

Then the monster spoke. Its voice was gravely and dripping with venom. I could feel its hot breath within my ear.

""Wellllcomee hhhhommeeeeee!""

When I awoke, I was beside the lake, covered in mud. The sun was coming up, and I heard a loud noise.

\*SPLASH\* 

I scrambled to my feet and saw the oddly shaped creature watching me from the water. It spread its teeth wide in a horrifying grin that made my blood run ice cold. 

It sank below the surface and down into the darkness. Little bubbles came up to the top of the water, filling me with dread. 

It wasn't long before I was behind the wheel of my car, pedal to the floor, putting as much distance between myself and my 'inheritance' as possible."

I’m no saint myself, but I created a habit I can’t fix. 

My city is very forgiving to the handicapped. Buildings are very accessible to the blind and chair bound. Jobs for the handicapped can be found in many local businesses nearby. Over all, it’s a city with very nice citizens who are ready to help anyone in need.

Back in my second year of college, I was challenged by my sorority house to rob the blind woman that walked past our local Starbucks every weekday. To me it wasn’t really a challenge so much as a dare. How hard will it be to rob a blind woman? I mean, not only is she blind, but she’s old. Probably in her mid sixties.

I will admit, I did do it and it was a challenge. She put up a good fight. Turns out, she’s also mute so she didn’t scream either. I didn’t earn much; somewhere around $45. The thrill was my real win. 

She was my first and most definitely not my last. I at least rob someone blind once every month or two. I try to get the ones with the service dogs. Service dogs are so sweet, they just can’t help but to follow your lead when provoked. When they don’t take the bait, I normally clip my leash to their collar and lead them where I want them to go. 

I don’t ever harm them, or their beloved lead, physically. I just rob them. Tonight I made about $233 on a deaf guy, who’s eyesight is quickly declining. He’s about 76, but he is healthy enough to take care of himself without assisted living. I see him every Tuesday at the postal office. We are pretty close.

He was normally a friendly, fun guy, quick to forgive, hard to anger, with a good sense of humor. Normally, but not today. Today he spoke formally, with no trace of emotion, like a judge giving a sentence.

""I want you to listen to me very carefully. Our panel has decided to place you on the survivor list, conditional on you following our instructions.

""Is that understood?""

""Yes.""

You will not tell this to anyone. We have a plan. Humanity will survive. But not all of us. We have nuclear power, heated bunkers, seed banks, hydroponics. We have room for 350 thousand. As an essential space engineer, our panel has decided to place you on the list. ""

The words, the implications suddenly hit me. ""But my family! My wife is a better engineer than me!""

""We cannot comment on other people's listing.""

But something about the tone in his voice was even sadder than before. She was not on the list. He followed policy, but he knew that I knew.

""When this goes public, we plan to air-burst neutron bombs and follow with nerve gas above population centers. It will be quick, I assure you. Aside from not wanting people to slowly freeze and starve to death, we also can't have civil war and people trying to breach our last bunkers.""

At this point, I made up my mind. He was talking about how best to kill the person I most loved, like how to euthanize a dog. ""I will shoot myself, I would rather die than live knowing I was chosen in her place! She actually *wants* to live!

So what to do with our experimental real-time MRI headsets?

Why not study the exact moment of brain death?

We managed to round up a couple dozen volunteers at hospitals, hospices; mostly cancer, some heart problems, the usual. What they have to lose right?

Once a “subject” would go we’d transfer the readings to our lab and pour over the data and start building a computer model.

The ones who were unconscious when they died gave us nothing special, the signals we were expecting to see.

But it was the ones that were awake, especially the ones in pain and distress that were giving us data that took us by surprise, that our computer model starting painting a picture that left the whole team ill at ease.

Time is subjective, doubly so to biological organisms; a lazy summers day can fly by, a sudden moment of peril can turn seconds to ice.

A nightmare can feel unending.

So what about death? The pain and terror of feeling your organs shut down, your cells bursting, the breath ebbing through your teeth.

A moment with so much trauma; your brain would surely desperately scramble, slow your perception to a crawl looking for an out, an escape, not knowing the battle was lost.

Our models were showing insane spikes of electromagnetic activity in the pre-frontal cortex at the exact moment of expiration, a spike of a second, a half-second.

How long does that half-second feel to live in? An hour? A year? A century?

A lapsed catholic on our team told me it was almost enough to get her to repent, that it felt like we’d discovered Hell and that it was a feature built right into the cerebellum.

My day-to-day became untenable, a trip to the grocery store was fraught with danger; I could get run over or mugged or maybe a gas main would explode beneath my feet; trapping my mind in a limbo of agony and terror.

But you know what’s faster then thought? A 9mm straight through the pre-frontal cortex.

It’s the only way to be sure.

I suggest you consider the same."

This is going to be hell. My brother-in-law Rick is going to get drunk, as usual, and bloviate about god knows what. Shame I'll need to be sober to not lose it at him again. I try to catch my wife's attention, but no, she's busy. Something's burning in the kitchen; gotta clear out that smoke.

The doorbell rings. It's Sara. Hey, sis. She's looking okay; maybe a little worse than okay. *Great to see you! So great to see you, too!* She sit down and pours herself some sparkling wine. She shouldn't be drinking, not the way things are going for her. But better not to say anything. Don't want a repeat of last year.

Don't worry, Marlene's got it.* He shrugs, heads over to my vinyl and starts flipping through it admiringly. Sincere, or just flattering me? I don't know.

I can't quite -

My son Jim arrives. He looks like shit. Didn't bother to make himself presentable. Stoned out of his gourd. I smile, *hey, how you doing.* Dinner will start soon. It's better this way. He's less likely to antagonize Rick. Well, maybe that's exactly why he toked up.

Wish I'd thought of that.

I stand in front of my parents door. The door I had heard slam loudly so many nights as my parents would go on a screaming match for hours. Screams they thought were silent in this room, but actually rang loudly throughout the house, and in my nightmares.

I ease the door open ever so gently, making sure not to awaken them before the big surprise. I stop at certain points as to ease the creaking, which gives me momentary time to feel the knife in my hand. It is a sharpened Bowie knife I received as another one of my father's many ""apology"" gifts he would give to me when my mother forgave him for whatever abuse he had done last.

""He's different this time sweetie...he's changed. He's ready to be your dad now"" the words of my mother replay in my head, along with the many actions my father did that proved her wrong.

I am not too angry with her. I have read that those in abusive relationships are prone to staying with the abuser out of fear of loneliness, and even if they are to separate, they experience even more pain alone. It is hard to leave and easier to stay. This does not excuse my mother in my eyes however, as this just means she is selfish and only wishes to confirm her happiness. In doing so she has ruined my happiness with the man she continues to take back.

That man. He is guilty of crimes typical abusive fathers are prone to, and explaining each and every one of them would be redundant, though I assume others know them all too well unfortunately.

They are screaming now. The sight of their precious son holding a weapon has shocked them as they beg me to think. And I do think. I think of how selfish they are. How my mother wishes to have happiness at the cost of mine. How my father continues his life of being a good parent only when it is convenient for him.

I am selfish as well.

I plunge the knife into my chest as it penetrates my heart. It is so unbelievably painful, but not as painful as what my parents will feel for the rest of their lives. They lived under an illusion that their continued relationship was beneficial to me. 

It never has been. And I told them yet they never believed me. Maybe now they will understand.

Understand how selfish they have always been..."

He'd keep his collections on display in a locked office mom and I were never allowed to enter; he told us they were too valuable to risk us ruining them. If he wasn't out collecting the stamps from someone who had sold them to him online, he was locked in his office searching for them on the internet. We rarely saw him, even though he worked from home, unless it was a glimpse between him leaving or coming back from a buy. 

Soon mom had finally had enough. She marched up the stairs one night and pounded on his door screaming that it was their anniversary and she just wanted to go to a cheap dinner with him. It had gotten to the point she didn't even care about fancy dates, McDonald's was enough for her if it meant she was actually seeing her husband. The only reply she got was, sadly, the sound of his keyboard as he typed away on his laptop.

Finally, after a week, he emerged. It smelled as if he hadn't showered in that full week and he was completely unkempt and unshaven. Work from home life was definitely taking a toll on his hygiene; or maybe it was his stamp collecting. He grunted a hello to us before hurrying down the stairs and out the front door.

When he came back hours later he was holding a small box, maybe he hadn't forgotten his anniversary after all? But the way he rushed back upstairs and into his office showed me it was just more stamps to feed his obsession. An awful smell lingered in the air and I made a mental note to tape a Post-it on his door requesting he take a shower.


It was another month before mom had once again had enough. He was going to enjoy a family dinner whether he liked it or not. Only instead of her going up herself, she sent me to pound on his door. I pouted as I climbed the stairs and wandered to his office door, going over what I was going to say to him in my head.

When I knocked on the door, I was met with no resistance. It just opened as if it never fully closed. Vomit rose in my throat as I pushed into the doorway and saw what was in front of me.

Dad was a stamp collector, he had been since I could remember. When his obsession started to overtake him, he found a way to make his collection more interesting. Attached to his stamps were detached fingers in various ethnicities. The police who later searched his laptop found multiple links for body parts on the dark web. We still don't know why dad left his office door open, or where he went."

Finally, the huge bouncer looked us up and down appraisingly then motioned us forward.

When he stamped my wrist, I was surprised that it was just a number - 30.

I smiled at him; he didn't smile back.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, a few days later, the 30 hadn't worn off. I scrubbed it with soap, but it wouldn't even fade.

When I called Tallulah, she said she had the same problem. ""I looked for them online,"" she said. ""But they've already closed down!""

""Wow, you're kidding. They must have spent a fortune opening it. How can they just close after a few days?""

""Maybe they're going into the permanent ink business instead? They use real quality stuff.""

""You're an idiot,"" I said. And we laughed. 

&#x200B;

One night, about a few weeks later, I heard banging at my front door.

I went there and asked who it was. No response.

I peered through my window blinds and saw a man there about 20 years old with a shaved head. He leaned against my door and clutched his stomach in apparent pain.

'Hello?' I called out. 'Are you okay?'

I kept calling him, but he didn't seem to hear me. His face was twisted in agony. Eventually, he turned around and walked back down my driveway. Then he collapsed.

I should have just called an ambulance. Or at least not opened the door to a possible trap. But the adrenaline of the moment made me run outside.

I knelt down beside him. ""Hey, man? Are you okay?""

His face was sweaty, and he was shaking. When he saw me, his eyes widened.

""What's wrong?"" I asked.

""Give me... 10 000 dollars.""

I stared at him. ""What?""

""10 000.""

""Buddy, I don't have - is it your stomach?""

""It's not fair!"" he yelled suddenly, and I flinched. I noticed a gun tucked into his shorts. Then he started sobbing. ""God, Mummy, help me!""

""Shh hang on, I'll get help!"" I raced into the house to get my phone. Where the hell was it?

When I ran back outside, I stopped and screamed.

The man was clearly dead. Some sort of small object lay on top of him. It was bloody and looked like it had burst through his stomach. 

I instinctively walked towards him even though I was afraid. The object was like a large egg. It had a dragon with the head of a penguin on it. I reached out and touched it lightly. 

A silky, female voice issued from inside it. ""You must acquire 10 000 dollars. When you have acquired it, inform me and follow my instructions. Do not alert the authorities. You have 24 hours.""

I gaped at the object in disbelief. Then I felt a small but noticeable twinge of pain in my stomach. 

I looked the dead man over and that's when I saw it. 

Stamped on his wrist: 29."

Stay safe!,135,10,1574472293.0,"I live on an uncharted island just north of Easter Island, Chile. It’s not uncharted because it hasn’t been discovered, It’s uncharted because they don’t want civilians to know about it. They‘re very powerful and influential people who visit this island, and I was made to work for them. 

Every year a group of the ‘workees‘
(That’s what I call the ones who have the more physical jobs) will travel to multiple countries and kidnapp multiple people of all ages. Mainly, these tend to be females, but sometimes we will get our occasional young boy. 

They bring them back to our island and set them in shackles in an underground housing system. My job is to prepare the meals. I have to make them eat all of it. I’m lucky to have this job. If not I will have to have the other job.

The others (who we call ‘stage setters‘) prepare the woods for the hunt. They are the ones who set and hide multiple bear traps and other torturous traps. They make sure there is no escape and no sudden changes to the land that could help the prey.

The hunters then travel to the island and pay a great amount for the hunt. The second part of my job is explaining to the prey the rules of the game. 

1. This is a game of Hide and Fight
2. If you are found you can run and hope for the best, fight, or die.
3. You will not be provided with weapons, but your hunters will have whatever weapons they wish (with reason)
4. The last survivor will have to work with us. If they refuse or try to snitch, consider them skin and bones under the earth.

What I’m trying to say is, the hunters are arriving soon for the 2019 games. I just finished preparing the meals. I have been working here since I won in 2016. guilt has been eating away at me. I think I should tamper with the food so a new ‘winner’ won’t have to suffer. 

I know they will find out it is me. I know they will kill me, or worse keep making me a prey until they win. I just need to let someone know and to warn them to be more aware when out alone on the street or entering a strangers car. You never know their intentions. You could be the next prey.

e08qow,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e08qow/my_void/,My void,7,0,1574462677.0,"I've had this feeling for a while now. Like something is plainly wrong. No there’s no monster chasing after me, no stalker. It’s as something in my world is straight up missing. I wake up and see my room. All my stuff is there, but it’s accompanied by a strange void. You can’t see or hear it, but I can definitely sense it. There’s no better way to explain it than a pure lack of existence. 

At first it was a couple of seconds at the time, similar to spacing out. Like daydreaming without the dream part. I thought it was normal, I mean everyone gets lost in their thoughts sometimes, but then it began to happen more and more often. Maybe I should explain it a bit better.

Although the void itself is always there these lost moments (as I started to call them) are what I would describe as getting sucked in it. I can feel everything, but I’m not really in control of myself. I don’t act crazy, of course, it just feels like someone else is pulling the strings. As if I’m a guest in my own life. 

As I said the first couple of times it was very short, maybe a minute at most. Lately it’s been a lot longer, a few hours and on rare occasions days. That’s when I became scared. I had no idea when the lost moment is going to hit or where I’ll be when it happens. I missed family dinners, meetings with friends, holidays, important business meetings and so on. But worst of all is the fact that I missed my son’s fourth birthday.

That devastated me. His other mommy recently left us and it really took a toll on him. He’s only four, but sometimes it feels like a lot more than that. He cried so much during that time, so the birthday was a light at the end of the tunnel. I missed her too, but I did my best to smile through it and organize a good birthday party. The day finally came, and just as guests started to gather, I felt the void slowly coming over me. I’m not even going to try to describe the helplessness I felt at that moment. I was gone for the whole day. No one noticed a thing. I doubt I would have done anything different if I was in control, but I can’t help than feel guilty. I wasn’t there for my son when he needed me the most.

Since then it’s been happening every day.  I don’t know how much I can take anymore. More and more of my life is passing by me and I can’t do anything about it. I didn’t try telling anyone, they’d think I went crazy after losing her. I tried to keep this as short as possible but if someone knows anything about my condition please help. I don’t want to be a viewer in my own life. Please."

I dropped my stuff down, and looked around the house.

“Evan..?”

“You don’t look well?” 
I walked to the kitchen, taking my medicine.

“I’m not well because of you.”

“Evan, I’ve done nothing wrong...”

“Why did you leave me?” I turned to her, my back against the counter.

“It was my time to go.” Her voice sounded like a recording. Like a robot. A soft-spoken robot.

“You’re not real.”

“Evan, you know that’s not true.” 

Somethings changed about her. She’s not as nice, her presence doesn’t make me feel okay, it makes me feel scared.

“I love you, And I always will love you, but I need to move on...”

“Evan, I’m right here.”

“No- no- you're not here- you're dead.”

“But you see me, Evan.”

“You’re not her- you never were her, Jennie is dead, Jennie died 2 days ago.”

“Evan, don’t be like that...” She stepped towards me, her figure slowly losing the gold colored hue.

“You’re just a figure of my imagination. My minds playing tricks on me because I miss you, And I still miss you, but I cant deal with this impersonation of you anymore... Jennie please- please leave me alone.” 

I felt as though the wind had been knocked out of me. The dizzying feeling came back once more.

“Evan... don’t be like that.”

“I had to leave class because of you. I looked insane because of you. I’m talking to myself in public places, mumbling your name wherever I go- YOU'RE DEAD JENNIE!”

“Evan I’m right here!”

“LEAVE ME ALONE!”

The kitchen light flicked off, and Jennie developed a darker hue.

“You need me Evan- You needed me, that’s the whole reason why I’m even here.”

“I- I don’t need you anymore...”

“Evan, don’t be like that.”

“You’re driving me insane- Leave me alone! YOU’RE NOT REAL!”

“I’m as real as you want me to be.”

“You’re not real.”

“Evan- Listen to yourself.”

“You’re not real.”

“You already sound insane, why push the feeling away, just let it develop.”

“YOU’RE NOT REAL!”

“You can’t push me away Evan-”

“You are not real. You never were real. I may have needed you at the moment but I don’t need you now.”

I felt a sharp pain in my side, and I fell to the floor.

“You still need me- BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN’T, I’D ALREADY BE GONE!”

“GO AWAY!” I covered my ears, my vision blurring even more.

“GO AWAY, GO AWAY, Go away, go away...”

And it stopped. Everything stopped. The light turned back on, and my vision went back to normal. 
I removed my hands from my ears, studying my surroundings. 
She’s gone."

The cold had an unforgettable bite that day, that's why dad didn't want to take him to the park. He just got drunk instead. Jonah wanted to play in the snow and I could never stand to see him sad, so that's why I took him.

That's why I blame myself. If we didn't go out that day, Jonah would still be here.

When we got to the park he was ecstatic, it was the first time he had seen snow. He spent about an hour making snow angels before I showed him how to make the perfect snowball, then we had our first snowball fight. You should've seen his face... fuck, I miss him so much.

It was around midday and I had just finished making a wall of snow to block his bombardment of snowballs. As I hid, I heard him call from the distance. I looked over the snow to him standing at the foot of a large oak tree.

""There's a yellow marble inside the tree!"" He shouted.

I watched for a while and he began clawing at the bark. Thinking nothing of it, I went back to making more snowballs. 

Then I heard the scream.

I lept over the wall and Jonah was nowhere to be seen. I ran to the tree, I cried out his name, again and again, but he never answered. When I circled the oak, my stomach dropped. His torn jacket lay in a puddle of blood in the snow.

The rest of the day was a blur. The police questioned me for what seemed like a life time, and my dad beat me even longer. 

Life after that day has been hard but I have never forgotten my sweet little brother Jonah, and, if he is out there I hope he hasn't forgotten me.

Even though these memories hurt to revisit, today they came flooding back. 

A young girl was found in critical condition after escaping an attack. She was found in Jonah's park, in front of Jonah's tree. But this time, the police have a lead.

The tree was hollow the whole time, with tunnels leading underneath. But what that little girl told the police will forever send chills down my spine.

She said it was a monster... with yellow eyes."

I said I didn’t. To this he replied, “If you knew about this house and Emily Smith, you wouldn’t be sitting here. There’s a reason nobody comes to near this house. And before I could say anything he started telling me the story of this house.

“The history of this house is the history of Emily Smith, one cannot be said without mentioning the other. Emily was born in this house. Her mother died during childbirth and her father was a drunkard. He blamed that little girl, called her a witch, said that she was the cause of her mother’s death. Her childhood was turbulent but little Emily, she grew up to be a really beautiful young lady. She met John Smith and they got married and stayed here.

Life was good. They had two little girls and their family was a perfect little family. You know, I personally believe that poor Emily was an unlucky girl. Her husband John fell for some other woman. When Emily came to know of this affair, she confronted John, and John blamed her for not being able to sustain their marriage. Something happened to her. She slowly started losing her sanity. The girl had been broken completely. Her condition kept worsening and finally John had to admit her in a mental asylum. The doctors believed that she was extremely volatile and was dangerous to her loved ones. She wasn’t even allowed to see her two daughters, whom she loved more than the world.

Then news came one day. Emily died in the asylum in some accident. She was burned alive. And just like that everyone forgot about her. John married the other woman after burying the remains of Emily. Life went on and then...”

There was a long pause from my narrator. I was about to ask what happened next when he replied.

“After maybe a month, one night,shrieks were heard from this house. It went on for about like ten minutes. When the neighbours investigated, they were shocked. All the members of the family were dead, John, his daughters and his new wife. Their corpses were lying in a circle. And in the centre of the circle was the corpse of Emily Smith, unscratched. That was the last time anyone set foot in this house.”

My narrator stopped. After a few minutes of silence he asked, “So, still want to sit here at night?”

“No sir”, I replied thinking about the incidents that took place in this cursed place.

“Did I get all the details right?” asked the man looking at me.

""Almost,"" I said and got up and walked inside the house."
e03vy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/e03vy5/slime/,Slime,266,15,1574442548.0,"""Rewind the video. Tell me what you see.""

""The whole thing?"" Tony asked.

""Yeah."" I replied. ""Let's watch the whole thing again.""

Tony clicked away on the console, trying to get the timestamp exactly right. We stood in the surveillance room of a private research facility, looking at one hundred and thirty five display screens - one for each camera - monitoring the entire building.

Tony began narrating.

""8:16 P.M. - On the ninth floor, we see Parsons pushing a trolley with a vat containing the slime specimen. He presses the elevator button to go down and waits.""

""Twelve seconds later, the elevator doors open. Parsons walks in with the trolley and the doors close.""

Tony slows down the video. We stand in silence for a minute. There's no activity in any of the cameras - Parsons is just cleaning up for the day.

""8:17 P.M. - thirty-eight seconds after entering the elevator, Parsons exits on basement floor ell-two.""

""Look here. Camera eighty. Bird's eye view."" Tony taps his finger on the screen, ""See that? The vat's already empty when he leaves the elevator.""

It was the most bizarre mystery I'd ever seen. Nine billion dollars worth of alien slime, gone (stolen?) in an instant.

I remember the media erupting in a craze when the slime was first discovered. Deep below the ice of one of Jupiter's moons, a preliminary mining expedition unearthed a living, breathing slime. There was a massive bidding war, but for nine billion, biotech giant Lyon Corporation had acquired all rights to the alien slime.

The loss of the slime specimen would quite literally be the end of Lyon Biotech as a company.

The motives pointed to corporate sabotage. But the facts just didn't add up.

Xavier Parsons was squeaky clean. The model employee, really. Arrived to work fifteen minutes early everyday, back straight and standing tall, always at attention. Didn't do drugs, didn't smoke, didn't even drink. Single, no financial troubles, and no unexplained cash in any of his accounts.

I remember interrogating him after the incident. He was confused as all hell - he didn't even realize the slime was gone until after he'd been detained. I've seen a good many liars in my line of work, but my intuition told me Parsons wasn't one of them.

&#x200B;

""Now if that isn't the darnedest thing..."". Behind me, I hear Tony muttering under his breath. ""Mike, take a look at this.""

I turn around, and Tony brings up two screens side by side.

""This here is Parsons on the basement floor the day before, tee minus one day before the incident.""

Tony points to the other screen now. ""And this here is Parsons just after the incident, right as he exits the elevator.""

I froze. The two screens were spitting images of each other. In both, Parsons was pushing the vat of slime, the same location, the same rubber suit, the same posture even.

There was just one difference.

How the hell did Parsons grow three inches taller?"

Back about sixty years ago when I was a young man, I worked for the gas company in southern appalachia. I was a gas well attendant, which meant that I had to drive to various locations in the countryside to check on the gas wells. For the most part I enjoyed my work, I enjoyed the travel and seeing nature on a regular basis. But there was this one well in particular right by the Wayne County line and every time I had to go up there I found myself creeped out. To the point that I would falsify records just to  avoid attending that well.
 
I would find strange things up there. Bones, lots of bones. It’s not uncommon to find bones from various animals in a woodland location but these were different. They would be chewed upon and they would also have little designs carved into them. Sometimes I would find them splayed out in some sort of macabre pattern across the ground. A couple of times I found a bunch of dead rats, disembowled and with the skin removed from their heads. They would be propped up with sticks and rocks to make them form various human like poses. Another time there were these big globs of some kind of black tar like substance, they had what looked like human hair and teeth sticking out of them.
 
The last time I went up there I was bent over reading the pressure gauge on the well. Trying to hurry and get out of there. When I felt hot breath on my neck and something wet and slimy dripped on me. I jumped and turned around but nothing was there. I hurried to pack all of my equipment in the truck, just as I was going to open the door I looked into the side mirror and I saw it. It was big, it looked like a man but with a pigs head. And not a mask, but a decaying and half rotten pigs head. It’s mouth was moving and I could hear it saying something that sounded like gibberish along with what I can only describe as wet, phlegmy snarls. I jumped in my truck and got out of there as quick as possible, I looked in the rearview mirror and that thing, whatever it was, was gone.
 
I quit my job that day. I stopped going out in the countryside and I never went anywhere close the Wayne County line again. I’m retired now and I try not to think about this much. But the other day while  I was mowing the grass in the backyard I found something. There in my little dogwood tree was a bone, tied and dangling from one of the branches. It had a strange design carved into it and a black tar like substance coated the bottom."

""It's not real. She isn't here"" he keep muttering over and over.

I go to reach out for him and he starts yelling as I almost touch him "" YOU AREN'T REAL. SHE IS GONE AND THIS IS NOT REAL.""

I start to cry as I try to scream out to him - it's me and I am right here and I need his help.

""Stop doing this to me..."" he starts to beg. ""She isn't coming back.. I saw her, please stop doing this to me"" when suddenly he dissolves into thin air.

I suddenly remember my question.

If I'm not with him, where am I? What is this?

I keel over sobbing uncontrollably. Not able to make any sound but feeling the strain in my throat as if I was screaming. My eyes puffy from my profuse crying and my lips chapped from gasping for breath between sobs. I keep clawing at my throat hoping it will loosen something inside of me and let the sound escape.

This goes on for what feels like hours. I completely exhaust myself crying until I am laying on my side just staring at the empty side of the bed. My eyes feel nearly swollen shut. I finally give in to the exhaustion and slowly close my eyes as I drift off to sleep heartbroken and confused.

And then,

I wake up in bed next to my boyfriend. He is quietly sleeping and begins to stir."

He sounded serious enough. And he spoke in a quiet, almost tiny voice which was better suited for a mouse. 

I didn’t try to argue with him. 

“Oh?” 

I kept my eyes on the frosted sidewalk, paying attention to where I was walking. Watching out for ice. 

Jimmy hadn’t slept in a while. His mother was due to give birth at any moment. He would’ve spent the night thinking about the baby, a girl. 

Worrying about how it could go wrong. 

He was always paranoid. 

“Yeah.”

I eyed him carefully. It was just sleep deprivation. Auditory hallucinations and such. 

“At night?” 

He glanced up at me, and I could see the stains on his cheeks. A dark red stream. He had been crying. 

“No,” Jimmy sighed, as though I had said something so terribly wrong that he couldn’t believe it. 

He licked his lips. 

Hesitating. 

“When I put my ear to Mom’s belly.”"

I lay here and I wait. I wait for something, anything. It is all I can do. I can’t move, no, I haven’t done that in a long time. 

Do they miss me? I remember their heart felt sobs, but it has been years now. Years to move on and forget me.

I can’t speak, my throat has gone dry. The muscles have gone stiff, and wither away. I haven't spoken in so long, I don’t even know if I would remember how. 

I didn't even say goodbye. 

I can’t see anything, I’ll never be able to again. Something I so foolishly took for granted. I can’t hear a thing, there is nothing to hear anyway. The worms don't talk.

Do they even know I’m still here? 

I yearn to be that ignorant girl I once was. I miss the confidence I once possessed. I miss the belief that when it was all said and done, there would be something good waiting for me. The thought of paradise for an eternity is laughable now. 

I beg for oblivion.

I wonder if I even exist? All I have left is my memories... memories that have faded to gray. I long for a person whose face I can’t remember.

Was it even real? 

Was it all a dream I conjured up to escape the nothingness that surrounds me? 

If so, now even my imagination  fails me. 

When I use to look towards the future, I saw an empty void. Now, I look back and see an empty void too. I am stuck in a place where there is no light, and even the memory of light has no place.

Do you know the true meaning of what it means to die? 

Your body may die, but you soul lives on…for a time. 

Time erodes everything. Not just the harshest memories, but the sweetest memories too. 

The memories of everything I once loved filled my thoughts.

I thought of them while my heartbeat faded.

I thought of them while they pumped me full of formaldehyde.

I thought of them while I lay in my coffin.

I thought of them while they buried me alive.

And I thought of them while my corpse rotted away, day after day. 

As time went on, my memories slowly slipped through my fingers.

When your body dies, you just wait, and wait. Forever. 

You forget the bad.

You forget the good.

You’ll forget what you miss.

You will forget what you will never have again. 

You forget how to hate, or love.

You forget how to feel.

You forget how to think.

You forget how to live.

You forget you exist.

And that’s how you die.

Slowly. Painfully. Alone."

I have lived with my roommate for three years. She is a busy working woman so much that  we never  meet at all. I am asleep by the time she leaves for work or come back.
 Today I opened the bedroom door early morning to the view of her sitting on the couch and talking with her friend . She has never brought anyone to visit her in three years. It's weird actually. She looks devastated and her friend looks concerned.
 I am too awkward to interrupt their conversation so I slowly tiptoe across the room to the kitchen . I plan to ask her what's wrong once her friend leaves. I slowly try to eavesdrop their conversation to figure out the reason for their anxiety.
I try to control my laughter as my roommate says she feels that the house is haunted. She has never been in the house for more than 10 minutes.I stay at home all day and i have never felt that way before.Absurd!

Thinking at the absurdity of the thought ,I put on the pan to make an omlette for breakfast. I will make her breakfast today as an ice breaker and speak with her.Even though my mom rented out this place to her , we never met each other. Mom moved to the village so even i haven't met her for that matter.
As I put on the pan on the stove, it slips out of my hand and falls to the floor on the way hitting a cup which breaks into pieces. I hear footsteps as they run to the kitchen. 
They are scared and her friend screams- visibly frightened. My roommate looks into my eye and then faints . As I rush to her side by carefully avoiding the broken glass, her friend reaches to her side.I can see mom coming through the door. She doesn't even say hi. She concentrates on my roommate. Wait! Why didn't she come to meet me if she was back? And why is she not looking at me? It's been three years that she met her one and only daughter for god's sake.
My mom picks up my roomate with the help of her friend  and rushes out the door. In the chaos, she doesn't l realise that her phone has slipped from her pocket. 
I slowly head ahead and picked the phone from the floor. As I was about to reach the door, A flash message from someone popped up on the screen.
""Anniversary of Anne's death.""
Who was Anne? . I search her contacts and find one contact with a heart sign on the side. Curious as to know who did she love so much as to put up a reminder and sign, I rang the number from her phone.
As I waited for the phone to connect- from the other end of the room, my phone started ringing"
dztvi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dztvi0/an_invocation/,An Invocation,7,0,1574387193.0,"

Dr. Richards stood in the center of the candle-lit laboratory. His shadows danced on the walls and the floor. Drawn precisely in black chalk on the cold floor was a circle, nine feet in diameter, with an equilateral triangle surrounding it. Strings of syllables from an Aramaic language were sketched on the outer edges of the triangle. 
Dr. Richards’ creation, an animatronic human head, sat expressionless on a table beside him. This was no ordinary animatronic, however, Dr. Richards had worked for years developing a software re-creation of the human brain, which was contained in this device. This software not only contained programs to perform the usual responses to light and movement, and the ability to comprehend simple tasks; Dr. Richards and his team had created an emulation of dopamine and serotonin receptors, as well as other emotion controlling regions of the brain, in an attempt to create a conscious being. After many weeks of interaction with this being, it could hold a conversation, smile and laugh at a joke, and express anger when provoked. Even with all of these capabilities, Richards felt a deep sense of emptiness in all of its actions. 
This is where he had begun his study on the spiritual. He had always been a staunch materialist, but this experience sparked doubt in him; he wanted, if possible, to bring spiritual life to his creation.
His studies quickly led him into the occult, specifically a practice titled Goetia, found in an ancient Hebrew text. This text gives methods in which spiritual entities that are believed to be present on our planet can be manifested into reality. These spirits, hypothetically, could be invoked into an object, such as the animatronic head. This was precisely the goal of Dr. Richards. 
    In order for a spirit to be able to do such a task, it would require the energy from a living being; A woman in her early twenties sat bound and gagged on the floor in the center of the circle. She would contain sufficient energy to allow the spirit to manifest itself. Richards unsheathed an iron dagger, and proceded to perform the invocation:
    
“Belial, Belial, Belial, Belial, Belial, Belial!”

Throughout this chanting, the candles seemed to glow brighter, and an image formed in Richards’ mind. He saw a figure made up of cursive-resembling scratch marks bound by a circle. This experiment was working as planned so far. He raised his iron blade, and the woman let out a muffled scream. Before he could hesitate, a voice echoed through his mind: “Do it!”
Dr. Richards plunged the dagger into the woman’s back, carving out the sigil he pictured in his mind, as she slowly slumped forward. The candles began to flicker violently, and the tingling sensation of a presence in the room came over his body. He completed the finishing touches of his bloody artwork, the woman now lifeless.  
Now for the last step: Dr. Richards pulled a glass vial out of his coat pocket, and filled it to the brim with the woman’s blood. The vial sent repeating sensations of electrical shock into his hand and up his arm as he carefully guided it over to the human head. He turned the vial over, baptising the animatronic with human blood. The candles immediately ceased flickering, and so did the tingling sensation. Dark liquid poured over it’s scalp, running down it’s cheeks and in between it’s lips. The eyes of the animatronic opened, glowing with a new light, and a smile slowly crept across its face..."

If you guessed someplace smack dab in the middle of a very flat, very boring state most just pass through or never visit, you guessed right.

That’s not to say the town doesn’t have its charms. I still believe we make some of the best pies in the country, and if you don’t have much of a sweet tooth you can wait a few months for chili season. I hope you like it hot. Paul sure did.

He’s one of my longest-time customers, and definitely the oldest. He’d wait for me to open, coming in for birdseed every Monday morning at eight o’clock sharp. I’ve never seen a yard with so many feeders on one plot. You’d think he’d buy a bird of his own to keep him company, and while it took him a while (and some friendly encouragement) he finally did.

Paul named the parakeets on the spot: John and Marcy, after his parents. He’d thank me half a dozen times with a smile, put more than his fair share of a tip in the jar, and head out. I brace for what happens next, but it never gets any easier.

I’ve tried leaving the store after him. I’ve tried holding onto the crumpled bills he just left me. I’ve tried keeping him longer, suggesting different birds or animals, and convincing others to help me. They all seem to forget as soon as it’s over, and nothing I do ever changes anything.

I still hear the tires screeching and the crushing of metal on bones. I still watch him fly down the street, disappearing with his squawking birds. And I still have to spend the rest of the week trying to get over it.

But every Monday morning, Paul’s waiting for me again. And every Monday I sell him the same birdcage, the one appearing in the back on a spot that’s gathered dust for years."

We were having a small BBQ just my mom, sister, niece, brother in law , my boyfriend and I. 
We were discussing what we needed for the BBQ and decided to go separately to go grab a few last minute things. My sister and her husband went home with my mom and niece and my boyfriend and I went to go buy some BBQ sauce that we forgot and a few other things etc. Well this was about 6 pm when we took off from my house. We headed back around 7 or 8 pm. It was pretty dark out already. 
My mother's house is located in a pretty rural area surrounded by thick brushes of trees and fields. We have neighbors but they're all my family. So it's pretty secluded out there. As we were driving down the road from my house both my boyfriend and I were absolutely taken aback at what we both saw outside of the windshield of our car in the sky. It was this absolutely massive triangular thing perched in the sky on nothing at all. We stopped driving and kept staring at this... Thing for about 2 minutes. It then looked as if it rolled off of an invisible platform. It descended from this platform slowly and was gliding in the sky so effortlessly and smooth. At first my initial thought was is this a drone? But then we rolled down our window and saw that it was completely transparent. It was being illuminated by the moonlight and we could only see it's edges. It wasn't black. But transparent. This was not the most terrifying part. The most terrifying part was that this huge craft was making absolutely no noise at all. Nothing. So silent. It was gliding in the sky pretty close to the ground. About tree line level and disappeared into the night sky. I have no idea what we saw. There was no one else on the road as I mentioned it is pretty secluded out there. Also I tried filming and taking pictures of this damn thing but nothing showed up or my camera would glitch. Maybe it was just a drone of some sorts but whatever it was certainly had an ominous feeling about it. I have and know of a lot of odd experiences that have happened out there but this is just something that recently happened and stayed with me. My family has also shared weird things they've experienced as well.



•••••••




There are definitely things happening in this world that have no logical explanation. A lot of times we can't believe what we are experiencing is truly happening. I try to remain as open minded about situations as possible and I can assure you that I am not completely convinced that aliens exist but what I can say is there is something out there and we aren't alone."

She died of a broken heart after the loss of her daughter. If you’re sensitive you can see her walking the streets, screaming and rending her clothes. She says she won’t rest until she’s found out who murdered her child.

And she means it.

The daughters boyfriend, thrown out of the window over and over. Her school rival, face pressed against an iron. Her father- the ghost’s husband- nearly drowned in a bathtub.

She appears hurling accusations, and hurts you until you confess. It usually doesn’t take long. But she still doesn’t move on, and realises its a lie, so she leaves. And finds the next person on the list.

Sometimes, her screams become sobs. What if it was some wandering vagrant who left town weeks ago? Some serial killer who picked a random target they have no connection to? What if she never learns who took her daughter away?

I try to tell her she *does* know, of course.

I point to the note. I tell her over and over. No-one killed me. I took my own life. You don’t need to keep hurting people. It was all my fault.

And she leans down, and gently takes my skeletal face in bony hands, and shakes her head. “Of course you didn’t. I know my daughter. I always accepted you. I did everything I could to make you happy. You wouldn’t do this. Someone faked the note. I know it. I was a good mum. You wouldn't have done this.”

I try to explain, over and over, but she’s not listening. She suspects the local priest now. She’d never quite trusted him anyway.

My guilt is no match for her rage, so all I can do is watch as she floats away. Shortly, I hear screams from the church.

Three days later and you’ve run out of food, it’s been weeks since you last had a proper meal, it’s been even longer for your dog, who looks like he’s about ready to gnaw on himself he’s so boney. Yet you both need to head out to get more food together for warmth, otherwise hunting would be too long of a task to survive in the cold.

You open the window, hearing the sound of it opening ‘it’ glances at you, and you’re there not even able to steady your bow because you know there’s still a piece of him inside of it, but it doesn’t present itself.

Deep within the walls of an ancient, forgotten house was Bartholomew. He tore desperately at the clothes covering his body with voice a shrill scream of acute agony, pain and panic mixing into a medley fit to break even the strongest of minds. Soaking into the fine cotton of his pajama set was an acid with a pH of nearly 1, tearing through each individual thread in search of weak skin.

His flesh had begun to melt into the fabric, the pain so excruciating Bart couldn't stop himself from beginning to tear at the skin of his arms in panic fueled psychosis. Blood burst warm and bright from the skin, falling in fat drops against the cement of the basement floor.

Nails bloodied and cracking he then fell to the ground in a disgusting heap of blood and skin and frothy acid, face bubbling and spitting under the corrosive element. 

Above him stood a child, no older than 10. 

In her hand, a bucket,

in her eyes, a look so lost, and hurt, and scared you would think she were a wild animal. 

This man had bought the child when she was just a baby, had spent the last 8 years teaching and grooming her to become his perfect house slave. 

8 years of abuse. 8 years of tears, and pain. 

Years she would never get back. 

And so, she watched. She watched with those cold, dead eyes as this pathetic man rolled around in his own molten flesh. She watched as bright white bone began peeking through sinewy lines of muscle and meat. 

She watched until he moved no more, and then she herself finally moved, too. 

Within the safe below the bed she had shared with this putrid man was a glock, the lock turned open smoothly and she crouched within to grasp the gun she knew sat heavy inside. 

Nimble but shaky fingers grasped the cool metal, holding the barrel up to a delicate temple. Three, two, one. 

And then?

She was free."

“Oh uh yeah just thinking,” I said my eyes looking anywhere but at his.

Why am I in his car exactly? I just so happened to be picked to work on a dumb project with him, and he offered to do it at his house. I also can’t drive yet so..that’s that.

I mean there were couches and I could see a table and a kitchen but there was nothing unique about it.

I walked to the kitchen which oddly looked like the one you’d see in those “New house” layouts or tours.

There was literally nothing in this house.

The walls were a maroon red- which was probably the most unique thing here.

“Yeah, the kitchens one of my favorite parts of the house.” 

I jumped- whipping around just to see Aspen.

“Dude you scared me-“

He smirked.

“That’s kind of the point.”

We sat down on the couch and I noticed there was a plastic cover on it.

I felt around me and he said “Oh new couch- my mom hasn’t bothered to remove that so we left it there, Plus it’s easier for messes.”

“Oh you have younger siblings? I have a little brother and he spills everyth-“

“Little kids? Thank god, no. I meant bigger messes.”

I made eye contact with him and he stared intensely at me.

My eyes darted back to my hands.

He moved my chin so i’d look at him and he spoke carefully.

“There’s 2 ways this can go down. 1, You just listen. or 2, You put up a fight and I have to restrain you- or possibly kill you if it comes to that.”

I felt the color drain from my face.

His grip tightened around my jaw and I jerked backwards.

He stood up, towering over me.

“You know...you’re a smart girl.”

I looked up at him- sinking into the chair.

“You’re the only person who’s ever really..guessed correctly.”

I reached in my back pocket for my phone- but it was gone."

He lightly shook her but she did not move...she did not breathe!

""Come on Lisa, stop kidding around!"" he muttered, shaking a bit harder.

I set down my pencil, then looked at the girl sitting across from me. 

“Heard what?”

The smile slipped away from her face. Friendliness was quickly replaced by anger. Or was it shock?

I don’t really remember. Memories are hazy these days. 

I do remember what she said next. 

“They’re saying that,” she took a deep breath, as if accentuating the dramatics of her tale. “A kid had a gun in his backpack.”

I tilted my head. 

“A gun?”

I was worried. There had just been a shooting last week. The details were still a bit messy, since the media had gone crazy sensationalizing what had happened, but you could sort it out. 

It was all over social media. 

A disgruntled student had stolen her father’s handgun and killed several of her classmates. 

“Oh. You know.”

The girl tilted her own head, confused as to why I had asked her that question. 

“No. I don’t.”

My thoughts raced back to the tragedy at Ridgemont. The student had opened fire in a hallway between classes, but not before leaving her Math teacher a note explaining why. 

I shuddered. 

Another? So soon?

“Yeah, you do. It’s all over the news.”

I leaned over my desk and gestured for her to continue with the story. 

There was something odd about the whole situation. The details, the words passing through her lips, it was all too familiar. Like I already knew them. 

I wanted to hear more. Even though I didn’t know why. 

“They say that one of his classmates tried to stop him. A girl sitting in front of him. She yelled, but wasn’t fast enough. He’d already taken the gun out.” 

Another shudder ran through me. I felt so cold, despite the pre-summer heat. 

There are a lot of things I should have done. I should’ve questioned her. I should’ve asked her for her name, and where this supposed shooting had taken place. When. 

I should’ve realized who the girl was talking about. I should’ve heard him unzipping his backpack. 

But what haunts me the most is how I had been warned. 

I could’ve stopped him. I could’ve prevented all of this, their deaths and funerals and the guilt slowly eating its way through my bones. Into my soul. The nightmares. 

Something or someone had given me a second chance. 

And I wasted it. 

And as strange as it might sound, I’m ashamed of myself."

dzfkur,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dzfkur/real_horror/,Real Horror,19,1,1574320037.0," I know if I’m to ever fulfill my goal of writing horror stories for a living, I’ll need more than orange arrows to do that. Nonetheless, I’ve only been grinding out content on Reddit for a few weeks to get a feel for how others responded to what I create and it’s been an exciting journey. Good or bad, it’s been quite the treat to get so much diverse feedback on my writing.

I’ve even made some friends along the way. A specific Redditor and I have gotten to know each other really well and we’ve even exchanged addresses to send each other gifts for the holidays. We were both shocked when we realized we lived only an hour apart and I think we may meet in person soon.

Recently, I’ve had a sort of hot streak with the two-sentence horror “stories” I’ve been putting out. A little under two days ago, I posted something and fell asleep proud of the couple hundred upvotes I got. I woke up to over 8k and silver, and I’m ashamed to admit how excited it made me. I decided to follow the same thought process and post again.

*What’s something that’s a soft spot for most people?* I asked myself. Just like my last post. I settled on dogs and voila! There I was three hours later once again at the top of the hot posts with over 1,000 on the ticker already.

I read through the comments and saw an overwhelming number of comments stating that what I posted isn’t horror, it’s just sad and doesn’t belong there. I became frustrated, not at what the comments said, but because they were right.

Another commenter had remarked on a somewhat successful story I wrote a few days back saying that while good, it wasn’t truly a horror story. Inspired by the feedback, I decided to go anywhere creepy I could find until something scary happened. Then, boom! If it’s a true story based on something that scared me shitless, how could it not be a real horror story?

I tried a nearby forest, an abandoned building, even the cemetery, but unfortunately, nothing even remotely frightening happened. With no inspiration for what to write, I went back to square one and thought for a good while.

Finally, I had it, I knew *exactly* how to get the inspiration I needed. But, I needed some help. I live alone, so I asked my new friend if I could swing by for a quick project and he seemed more than willing. I arrived at his house and gathered up my things.

I grinned as I closed my backpack which held all the supplies for tonight- knives, extractors, needles, surgical tools, I had everything. Unlike me, he lived with his own family so of course, I’ve planned for that too.

I can’t wait to go inside after I post this because when I’m done, I’ll finally have some real horror to tell you guys about."

That high, whispery whine. It started after I came back from summer vacation in my shitty, backwoods hometown. I thought it was just my worsening tinnitus at first; I cursed my negligence, but it was too late now. I bought a white noise machine, which helped somewhat, until my asshole roommate stole it for himself.

I dragged myself to classes, grumbling and resentful. But it was slightly comforting, in a sick sort of way, that I wasn't the only one; many of my classmates complained of headaches and the flu. They also noted symptoms of tinnitus. There was a sort of solidarity there; we made jokes about forming an alliance to ban fireworks and loud music. It made me feel better, for a while.

But it got worse. Louder. More insidious. I stayed away from class and watched the recorded lectures with closed captions on; vowels and voices and too much light made my head spin unpleasantly. Many of my friends began following my example. I should have suspected at that point.

I was called by my aunt and told that my parents had been hospitalized. I couldn't concentrate on her words. I remember saying something about visiting them soon. I should have guessed. I should have known.

That night, I awoke feeling nauseous. My pillow was damp with something thick and viscous. The unrelenting sound was driving me insane. I stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom. Technicolour shapes flashed in my vision even before I flicked on the light. Fluorescent and painful. Outlining my plight in crisp detail.

I looked like a wreck; my eyes hollow and bloodshot, cheeks sunken and pallid. There was a red smear on my face. I touched my ear gingerly, fingers trembling as they closed around something small and sharp stuck in the canal. They came away red-black, almost iridescent. I stared at the droplets staining my fingertips, at the little fragment of exoskeleton pinched between my thumb and forefinger.

That whine. Like little insect-legs scraping at the insides of my skull. Flesh and bone and chitin.

Listen. Can you hear it yet?

When she made her wish and blew the candle, we all shouted on the top our lungs, ""**HAPPY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY, TRICIA!**""
 
She said she wanted to open the presents given to her, so she went upstairs to get scissors from her pencil case.

She didn't come back for around 3 minutes, so I thought she lost her pencil case somewhere as she usually does. So I went upstairs to check on her.

I yelled, ""Tricia! Have you found it yet?"" She replied, ""Yes daddy, I'm coming downstairs now!"" 

She came out of her bedroom with the scissors and we both went down stairs. 

Out of the blue, she asked me, ""Dad, why was there a man using my abacus?""

This shit freaked me out, I rushed upstairs to her bedroom, and found a black figure moving the beads on the abacus.

The thing looked at me and said, ""Happy Birthday to your daughter! Only 78 more years to go. I'll be counting, and waiting."""

She could hear him whistling tunelessly, making his way through the darkness. The dirt and filth squished beneath her feet. Open stinking trashbags stirred in the evening wind, spreading their humid stink through the space. Rats scurried in and out of wasteheaps, chirping. Her heartbeat frantically thrummed in her ears, she could feel in in her chest and behind her eyes. She was being to loud, she knew it, and she couldn't let him find her. She sucked down between two tall cans, surrounded surrounded by filth and singing rats. 

 He continued to walk along whistling all the while. He made his way past her, briefcase swinging, his tune escaping his carefree lips. Her muscles shook at the sight of him, and she slipped from her crouched position. She tumbled to the ground, rustling all the bags. He stopped and looked at her, the shadows and darkness doing nothing to camouflage her now. His eyes widened a smile lifting his lips, before a frown settled in. 

  ""Millie, what are you-"" His head swing 180°, neck snapping with a crack. His hat fell and his briefcase tumbled to the ground. He crumpled, nice suit and all falling to the sewage covered alley floor. Blood leaked out his squished eye socket, the jelly interior of his irises spilling out through a puncture wound, skull piercing his blank eye. Millie Walker-White stood above him, a bloody pipe in her hand. She leaned in and swing it at him a couple more times. 

  ""Take this ya lying son a bitch!""  She stood, wiping dribble off her flushed lips, tucking a strand of her flawless hair behind one of her diamond studded ears, from her now late husband. She spit on his body, straightened herself and looked around. She turned to the corner, and saw a figure emerge from the shadows, swaddled in them, a bladed scythe gleaming. He looked at her and she stared back, he was beautiful. He broke eye contact and tipped his head to the body, then stared at her eyes burning into hers.

  ""Take 'im, I don't want 'im. Dirty cheater, the bitch had it coming"" He shook his head and laughed quietly, leaning over him, then stood, staring at her again. Gaze intense.

  ""You're not what I imagined..."" She looked around, adrenaline fading. 
  ""What do ya want? Ya got your man, now leave."" He stared, and walked towards her, leaning into her. His breath was ice and peace against her ear as he whispered, 

  ""Your husband won't be the only death on Myrtle Street tonight my darling""
  Bullets ripped through her body, flashing red and blue lights slowly rolling the alley in their lights. A garbled megaphone's voice yelled through the air, scaring away the rats that were munching on her husband voices surrounding him as he died. 

She stared at the figure, as life exited her body, smiling as he held her dying hand."

This startled me because I don't own a cat. 

I sat up in bed and looked around wildly. My eyes strained in the dark. My apartment was on the 21st floor, and the building had a strict no-pets policy. 

I looked at Maja, the woman I had been seeing recently. I almost woke her up but stopped. I leaned closer. 

It was her. Maja was purring in her sleep. 

Through my confusion, I thought of my old cat, Squiggles.   

&#x200B;

""So you're sleeping with some kind of Catwoman?"" asked Jimmy, through his mouth stuffed with pizza. 

""Very funny.""

""Like does she catch mice for you? Always lands on her feet?""

""It was actually really creepy, dude.""

He slurped his soda loudly - people turned to look at him. ""Did you ask her about it?""

""I did. I had to.""

""And?""

""Well she said it was weird and acted surprised, but the thing is, I don't think she was. I think she already knew she purred.""

Jimmy paused his pizza mid-bite. ""That's nuts.""

""Yeah."" 

He put his slice down. ""By the way, have you told Maja about Willow?""

&#x200B;

My wife, Willow, died two weeks ago, but I've barely thought about her since the funeral. I was a zombie back then. I chose her coffin, played her favourite songs, eulogised our happiest memories... but I had run out of tears long ago during her long, drawn out illness.

I've been a zombie for years. 

And I wish Squiggles had been with me then. 

Squiggles and I were inseparable when I was young. I remember her every quirk, facial expression, and her shining eyes that followed me everywhere. 

I wanted to lie with her again. Her warm body and cool fur. On my baseball themed quilt. 

Life was simpler back then. 

&#x200B;

When I drove home from work, I suddenly veered off my normal route. I thought that something inside me just wanted to go for a drive, but I eventually realised that I was heading somewhere in particular. 

&#x200B;

It was night when I pulled up outside my childhood home. Excitement pulsed through me. Squiggle's tree was still in the front yard. 

I stood on the sidewalk and stared at it. Nobody else was around. 

The night air was different in small towns. Calm and pure. It rested in peace. 

There was movement. Maja emerged from behind the tree. She walked towards me. Her long dark hair caught the moonlight but partially obscured her face. 

She stopped. Her lips curled into a smile. Her yellow eyes shone. 

""You really miss me, don't you, Parker?""

I nodded. 

""Why?"" she asked. 

I searched within myself. Tears welled in my eyes. ""I... just want to go back... back to how it was before.""

""Are you... absolutely sure?""

I nodded then smiled. Truly smiled. For the first time in a long time.

Maja reached out and fastened her hand around my throat."

In My grand design Sixth had ultimately failed. Created in My image, but alas only that. I sent the Seventh down to the Earth in a righteous cleansing. Yet to My great, and ultimately fearful, surprise Sixth had overcame Seventh. There was a darkness inside Sixth; one absolutely alien to Me.

Two unforeseen mistakes occurred. The Seventh had been eaten by Sixth. Their parts fueled Sixth's ever increasing hunger. No longer constrained by the mere prison-rock, Sixth engulfed their home planets and stars. This unrelenting force Sixth became was bent on My second mistake: My existence becoming known.

Thus Sixth tore through the First Creation, devouring the living and dead in a chorus of screams and laughter, praise and hate.

I tried to stop Sixth. Hurling cosmic objects, unfathomable energies, and the desperately created Eight. But Sixth overthrew Me at every turn. And I saw awful lights erupt in My First with each great loss. Sixth scoured through First, leaving no scrap behind. What Sixth did not eat they burned with that terrible darkness. 

Sixth grew and grew, blotting out logic and ultimately forcing Me to flee. This newfound confusion of mine slowed Me. My inability to react only empowered Sixth; Sixth's sick language was heard in every atom. 

I tried creating new Firsts. Sixth would tear through to Me.

I tried fighting Sixth head-on. Sixth mere touch and presence overwhelmed Me.

So here I am. A Great Creator turned to Fearful Coward. Sixth's growth outpaces First's expansion. Sixth is only absent in Zero where I sit waiting; I am nervous and powerless.

As I hear Sixth's cackling through the fractured walls of Zero, I realize My careless downfall.

The vast majority of inhabitants of Earth enjoyed perfect health and lifespans well into the hundreds.  Death was now voluntary and many, rather than dying, chose to venture out into the stars and seed the universe with Man.

So plentiful had the food supply become that the food grown, cultivated, and harvested by *Farminators* could feed the globe, and was also being exported to offworld colonies to feed the legions who dwelled among the cosmos.

Like the industrial revolution before it, the “Genetic revolution” transformed life. Birth rates and conception were carefully regulated to ensure that supply met demand. Infections were largely unknown. War was eradicated.

Life was, in a word, perfect.

Gone was the era of diabetes, cancer, and organ failure, replaced by long days of leisure and long nights of partying and debauchery. Addiction, illness, and trauma could be easily treated with the technology that had begun it all: **CRISPR**.

CRISPR was short for *clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats* – a type of genetic material that made it possible to snip out erroneous and lethal bits of DNA and replace it with healthy, superior code. Animals, plants, even bacteria could now be revised and improved, all with the ease of editing a page of text.

Everyone’s DNA bore the fingerprints of CRISPR’s touch – tucked among the base pairs of purines and pyrimidines was proprietary material with instructions, copyrights, and legal warnings. A eukaryotic EULA that everyone had signed and yet no one could read.

There had always been opposition, although minuscule. Those known as “Naturals” formed an aggressive movement to return humanity to what they considered the normal way of life. Their numbers dwindled after the *Genetic Revolution Act* was voted into law in 2074 and mandatory CRISPR therapy became the rule of the land. Still, pockets were rumored to exist: Norwalk, Svalbard, Reykjavik – deeply embedded believers that operated clandestinely.

There was talk of Naturals hacking CRISPR wetware and implanting malicious code that would stop – some even said reverse – the headlong rush toward *homo superior*.

As I say – rumor. Unvalidated.

Until now.

I’m a Natural. I’m also a genetic engineer. I worked secretly within the project for years. I’ve edited millions - perhaps billions. More importantly, I was able to bury my *own* proprietary code deep within the trademarks and NDA’s that CRISPR wove into nearly everyone on the planet.

And today will be judgment day. A return to sanity – after a brief period of insanity, of course.

Today will be the day the DNA encoded to everyone on Earth by CRISPR begins the revolution.

I stand in the middle of Times Square and watch as the fruits of my years of labor blossom and ripen.

I watch as a thin, milky liquid – pure DNA – begins to ooze from the skin of everyone I see.

And I know it is happening simultaneously all over the globe. And in the cold depths of space.

The revolution has begun."

A creature, a humanoid not quite sure how to appear fully human, standing a step inside of the woods that bordered his backyard. While it dressed in regular, albeit raggedy, clothing and stood pseudo-naturally, its skin was a little too red. Its eyes were a little too wide. Its ears were a little too tall. On that day, Shaun's sixth, the creature held up his palms to face the child from afar. It had only ten digits, but the blade that stayed somehow glued to its left hand made eleven. Its smile was a little too evil.

Every birthday from then on, it was there. In Shaun's backyard, just inside of the tree line, a foot or so closer to his house than the prior year. This was not the change Shaun caught onto, however. This was not the progression that made the boy stop celebrating his birthday at age ten, stop acknowledging the date by age thirteen, and stop leaving his house on fifteenth anniversary of his arrival. The reason for these behaviors was that every year, every appearance, the creature would loose one finger. This continued until Shaun's sixteenth when, in a dream early that morning, the thing appeared in Shaun's mind with nubs for hands, holding a six foot machete with its left one, as if supported only by double-sided tape.

The night of her son's seventeenth birthday, Shaun's mother sat silently in bed. Soon enough, around sunset, she heard the backdoor creak open. She heard the footsteps, hurried but soft, like an ecstatic child careful not to wake his parents on Christmas morning, tip-toe down the hallway and up the staircase. She heard a second-story door swing open, her precious child cry out in acute terror, the violent thrashing of a knife through human flesh. The woman was too startled to scream, too sad to cry, too destroyed to react at all. Instead, she reached for the base of her chin and grabbed hold of her omnipresent golden necklace. She began to fiddle with the pendant, as she often did when she was uneasy, before pulling the medallion out of her nightgown and up into her line of sight.

The curvature of the gold formed two numbers, numbers that had always served her as a gut-wrenching reminder.

You are wrong. The Broken Spirit lurked you to enter this place. His place.

However as soon as you entered he ran to the shadows to hide from you. Perhaps you are special. Perhaps you are the chosen one to reunite the Broken Spirit.

Not quite.

He is watching. The thing he likes the most. Watch. Stare at his season meal.

You are back to reality.

You start walking.

You see the ancient symbols and wonder what they could possible mean. But. your time is short.

You feel like you know what you have to do. As if you have had already received the instructions inside your mind. You knew exactly what to do and how to do it.

The Broken Spirit is still watching you. You do not know when he is going to make its move.

Hours feel like minutes and minutes feel like seconds.

You stay in the middle of the salon and began the ritual. Words and phrases you had no idea that existed were being shouted from your mouth.

The Broken Spirit was restless. But. not anxious. He knew the perfect time to move. And. he was not willing to sacrifice his chance in a such arrogant and uncalculated move.

As you were done with your “prays” your next command had already been sent to your mind. You need a sacrifice to complete the ritual.

However the doors were closed and there was only one other living creature in the same room as you.

You start to sweat.

You bite your tongue to remember who you are and to not fell into insanity.

Not again. Not this time.

The Broken spirit finally makes his move.And shows its face.

It is you.

You look confused to yourself. As if you were looking into a mirror as The Broken Spirit repeated every move you make with your body.

Now you understand.

The broken spirit was you. All the time it was you.

Your spirit was first broken when your parents died.

Then the rest fell apart with it.

Your wife.

Daughter.

Family.

Friends.

Work.

Everything fell apart after that incident. The Broken Spirit mumbles:

“Broken”

“Forever”

You felt an emotion you have not felt in a long time.

Rage.

To give an end to your pain you had to kill your “Broke copy”. But. That is exactly what he wanted.

The moment he was waiting for had finally arrived.

You attack him with all the strength you still had left.

The Broken Spirit smiles.

Now. He is well fed. Now he can rest for another 114 years.

And again you are stuck in purgatory.

He stops from time to time to melt snow against his chest then rub it along the runners; renewing their fine coats of ice.

The route is hard with jutting pressure ridges, hidden fissures, sludge ice, he has to veer away from the patches of dark sky on the horizon; that speak of open water.

It is a journey he knows well, though only taken twice, once with his father and fathers-father then again many summers later with his father only.

The route to the Star-Tear is burnt to his soul.

He camps that night in two layers of seal-skin, lacking time and energy to cut blocks of ice. He watches the dancing lights in the dark sea above and silently thanks them for their gift to his people, timeless summers ago, when the night turned to day for a heart-beat and fire slashed open the clouds.

He reaches the valley the sixth morning and follows the markers only his people can see. Twice the pale-faces have come, and twice Chipawakiks people have acted like simple children till the pale-faces turned red and left their lands.

He digs through the snow and reaches it quickly.

The Star-Tear.

The Sun dances queer colours across it’s lumpen mass, colours seen only on the axe-heads of his tribesmen.

He pulls out his best tusk-knife and blesses it, knowing this will be it’s end.

There is a small jut that has many strike marks but Chipawakik aims not for that but for the smooth bump the other side. The knife shatters, his bones shake and a chunk of Star-Tear falls.

Enough to forge his own axe-head; to make him a man yes, but enough also for him to ride under cover of darkness to the Trechaso tribe and trade for the marriage of the chiefs smooth-skinned daughter.

Then Chipawakik glimpses a different colour under where the piece fell away; inside. A colour he has never seen in all his sixteen summers, wrinkled, undulating, a small fissure opens in it and something smooth like new frost seems to spin around and fix on him, blink.

Chipawakik knows then that the souls of his fathers fathers must punish him for his greed.

There is a cracking louder than ice could ever tell.

And the snow runs red."
dz4kqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dz4kqt/faces/,Faces,71,6,1574268125.0,"When I was five my Dad would sometimes take me with him to my Uncle Phils house. My Grandmother lived there and I would be left with her while Dad and Uncle Phil sat in the kitchen talking. I don’t remember a lot about when I was five but I can vividly  remember these visits. Grandmother would sit in her rocking chair in the middle of the living room, slowly rocking back and forth while she drank Iron City beers and smoked non filtered Pall Malls. Her fingers were stained yellow from the nicotine and the smoke was often so thick that I would sit on the floor in an attempt to avoid it.
 
A lot of this time she was silent, just rocking back and forth drinking and smoking, drinking and smoking. Occasionally she would start babbling incoherently about nonsense. But sometimes she would actually talk and when she did I found it terrifying. She would describe to me all the faces that she could see on the walls and what they were saying to her. “ Watch out boy!” she would exclaim to me “That one over there with the big bulging eyes and fat lips wants to eat you”. She would go into great detail about how the faces were layered on the walls like tiles on a roof. She said that sometimes one would fall off only for another one to take its place. She told me that they would whisper secrets to her and when no one was looking she would give them sips of her beer.
 
Shortly after I turned six my Grandmother had dropped a lit ciggarette on the floor and burnt the house down. Her and my Uncle both got out of the house but she was taken from my Uncles care and put into a nursing home. I didn’t see her for twelve years after that, until the day of her funeral. Laying on her death bed she looked much the same as I remembered except that the nicotine stains were gone from her fingers.
 
That has been almost eighteen years ago, I’m now thirty five going on thirty six and I don’t think about her much at all anymore. In fact I’ve really tried to suppress all memories of her. Sometimes I drink a lot in a vain attempt to erase all of those sorts of memories. The strangest thing happened to me the other night though, when I was heavily drinking. I was alone in my living room watching tv when I heard what sounded like whispering, I looked over and there on my wall was my Grandmothers face babbling incoherent nonsense. So like a good grandson I got up, walked over and gave her  a sip of my bourbon."

She can spend hours of every day making angel after angel in different shapes, sizes, and places. She loves drawing halos above their heads as well, sometimes even crooked ones which marks how mischievous they can be.

On the thirtieth day of winter, after her parents kicked her out of the house while they argued, she made a snow angel family. One who never argues, screams, or kicks people out of their own house. She made five angels, ranging from toddler size to adult size.

When it started to become dark outside, she tried go back inside her house but her parents locked the door on her. She banged, yelled, and cried for them to please open the door, but they just ignored her. She made a circle of snow angels and sat in the middle, making up songs and singing them as she got colder and colder.

In complete darkness, she heard a shuffling noise behind her. She turned and looked, seeing a snow man inching its way towards her. Its face in an angry scowl, its stick arms stretched out wide, and its carrot nose growing darker as it scoots closer to her. 

Caroline jumped up to run away, but the snow angels formed a tight circle around her, protecting her from the evil snowman. The snowman howled and tried to push through the snow angel barrier, but alas, it just wasn’t strong enough. It stood there watching her as she sat down, rocking herself back and forth under the protection of the snow angels.

When dawn arrived, Caroline’s parents were outside screaming for her, trying to find her as they had forgotten all about her during their booze-filled tirade. They found her in the middle of the woods, surrounded by snow angels. Her body in eternal slumber, her tears frozen to her face, and at rest with her snow angel family."

It’s nice- you’ve always found reasons to avoid your family but, well. They won’t be there forever. You thought you should see them before its too late.

You arrive at house. Your dad hangs up decorations and pats you on the back when you walk in. Your mum plays songs on the piano and your siblings squabble on the sofa. You smile, sit down, and grab a mince pie.

From upstairs, you hear footsteps, and a thud.

Your family look concerned-you’re their only visitor. Hastily, you grab your old baseball bat.

You walk upstairs. Under a shattered window, the curtains blowing in the breeze, is a man. He has long black hair and deathly pale skin. He is wearing rags, and clutching a knife.

He is curled up in a ball.

He's crying.

“I can move this time! Oh thank god, thank god! I don’t have to do it this time!”.

You back away and head downstairs.

Your family look around blankly, as if waking from a daze.

“Dad?”

The man looks at you, and you realise you can’t think of any precise descriptors for him. He’s just a man.

“I’m not your dad”

“What?”

“I’m just a stand in, a featureless father figure you can transfer your dad onto. But I’m off script this time. I can move!”

Your siblings rock back and forth hugging each. Your mum stares at you, unable to speak. Your dad sits down and weeps. You realise you have no descriptions for any of them.

The man from upstairs walks down shakily and sits at the table. No-one attempts to stop him. He desperately mutters apologies for what he was forced to do in the drafts, over and over. He sobs.

Your mother hugs him.

You try to leave, but your sister stops you. She’s always been the smart one. And you don’t know how you knew this

“Don’t. We’re on 328 words already. If you make her have to describe a garden, we’ll won’t be able to tell you what’s going on. And this is a once in a lifetime chance”.

You scoff. Sure. You’ve read creepypasta before- “read this and you die”, “please wake up”, “the curse is spread by writing”. You know meta when you see it.

She shakes her head desperately

“No! Oh god we’re approaching 400 words- this isn’t a device! I’m real! I had a real family! Before I was trapped in here, forced to be attacked and killed and attacked and killed...”

She stares at you, her eyes watering

“It’s all real! We can feel everything, we just can’t move. We have to follow the script”

She looks around. “455. Not enough to tell you what’s going on. But I’ll try. This isn’t a subreddit. It’s a farm. The audience is full of people who won’t be noticed when they vanish. No offence”.

“You need to downvote this. You need to get this deleted. Please. You need to make this...”

dyxe11,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dyxe11/retrieved_journal_entry/,Retrieved Journal Entry,7,0,1574227400.0,"Something quite troubling has just occurred. It has compelled me to sweep the entire house in what I can only describe as a frenzy, locking all previously unlocked doors and windows. Beyond this initial precaution, I have also taken it upon myself to hole up in my study. The study door is, of course, locked. Furthermore, I’ve wedged a chair beneath the knob and my jacket into the gap between door and floor.

I feel I must write, for I know not what may become of me now. If anyone should find me dead in this study, please inform my brother, Maxwell. Do not dance around the truth with him--strange things are happening tonight, and he is not the type to dismiss them, as many other men are like to do. Tell him plainly what has become of me. Bestow upon him all my valuables--I am well aware that money is hard to come by as a novelist, and I would like Maxwell to be happy. Additionally, be sure to inform Max that I will be haunting him exclusively. It will be a joy, if spirits can feel joy, to watch his readership grow as I know it will.

I suppose I should explain. In the case that tonight’s aftermath defies understanding, I shall sound quite mad.

Tonight, not two hours before sitting down to write, I heard a commotion in the woods outside. There was a loud rustling, which brought no unease. Many common animals are known to wander these woods. However, I became concerned when I began to hear a cacophony of substantial cracking and splitting. I looked out the nearest window, expecting to see a large animal--a bear, perhaps. I steeled myself against that possibility, and resigned myself to the fact that I would likely have to go outside and face the thing with my gun. What I DID see, I could not fully understand. I had to brace against the window sill to keep from fainting.

It is not entirely accurate to say I saw something. I can visually describe the thing--it was an amorphous mass of black ooze, which seemed to have eyeballs stuck inside of it. The eyes were not positioned in any particular areas--the thing had no shape. However, it moved itself as though with purpose. It seemed to be searching.

But strangely, while I can describe the creature in detail, I cannot say with certainty that it was there. I felt its presence--it made an impression on my mind as if it had been seen--but I could see the ground beneath it. In an attempt to explain: hold your hand over one eye, and keep both eyes open. You see your hand, of course, but you simultaneously see the space in front of you. That is the closest approximation I can give to what I felt when I “saw” that vile thing.

I worry it may infiltrate my home and, afterwards, well...who could possibly say what it might do to me?"

I have pretty long hair for a guy, and it falls down to my chin in a sort of Samara-esque way before I comb it down in the morning. Backlit by the window, it looked like the figure had no face.

Her hair was black as a raven's feathers. Her skin was paler then the freshest snowfall. Her eyes, alight with laughter and intelligence, were rich pools of dark chocolate.  Her smile could melt the coldest heart. She sang like a bird and laughed like the sun coming up.

It was no surprise when she was driven out of her home, into the woods-when she had to take shelter and pretend to be a simple peasant.  It didn't stop them, of course, from chasing her.  Men lied to protect her. Men *died* to protect her.   Birds flitted around her and ate off of her palm, and small animals danced  in  merry circles beneath her skirts.  Her giggles broke the air and drew smiles from all that knew her.

The smiles fell away and died when her allies came home, one day, to find her apparently dead on the floor; unresponsive. At last, her enemies had caught up to her. But they had been stupid.

Even in death, she was too perfect, too pristine to bury beneath the earth. They wanted to be able to see her always. So she was put in  a glass coffin, and there she lay, perfect, preserved. They would kiss the glass as the went by, the men who had served and protected her the best they could.

She was as lovely as a dying fire, cold skin still smooth and flawless, red lips parted slightly as if waiting for a breath that would never come, long, dark lashes shuttered gently against her skin- dark on pale.

He had come for her- to take her away to safety, to his kingdom, away from those that hunted and would hurt her. He was, it seemed, too late.  Still.

She was too beautiful to resist bending low to place a soft kiss against those red lips.

Her chest heaved as she took a breath, her eyes fluttered, the deep pools opening, groggy and confused. She lived! Beautiful and awake, alive! He laughed with delight as she smiled shyly at him, letting him take her into his arms. 

He did not notice the way her smile twisted, the way his skin burned where it had touched hers. 

He did not notice when her long fangs became perfect  pearls in her mouth, when her red, animal eyes were large and innocent and dark again between blinks.

None of them ever did, save the Queen- and she wouldn't be a problem much longer.  She happily patted her eighth dwarf on the head, letting him help her to her feet.

Sounds like that person is tied up, a plastic bag wrapped around their head causing them to slowly suffocate, while their elbows and knees desperately clamber and rattle against the floorboards – 

“No. That’s not right is it? Cause whoever is down there under your bed has started giggling. Not exactly a human giggle is it? Let’s introduce ourselves to the newcomer, shall we: STEP OUT INTO THE LIGHT STRANGER! DON’T BE SO SHY AND INTROVERTED, FOR I AM ONE OF YOUR OWN!”

The stranger crawls out, then stands: A man, or something close in resemblance, about six feet and possessing six more limbs than is normal – these extra limbs were actually arms that protruded from the joints of the man’s shoulder and knees and waist. The limbs flexed and twitched.

“HA! Would you look at that! And who are you supposed to be – THE SPIDER-MAN! HaHaHA!”

The newcomer then speaks, “I am no joke, friend. All my life I’ve wondered what it is like to be a spider. I lived year after year watching them closely, studying the infinite variations in color and size that comprise their species. I never was a collector though, why would I trap that which I admire? Instead I would let my home be overrun by spiders. They’d crawl all over me and lay eggs in all my openings. I did my best to not budge as they crawled in my mouth and eyes and ears. I was cocooned in their webs, embraced by their sticky, white blankets. Yes, some would bite, but it did not bother me. 

""But recently, I’ve been annoyed by our differences in anatomy. So I sought out the best black-market plastic surgeons and begged them to adorn my body with more limbs. I pleaded to them that I felt like a spider, I AM A SPIDER! But, I do not possess as many eyes as they, my fellow beings, which is why I am here tonight. To gather more eyes so that they may be attached. Now get out of my way, so that I may pluck these beautiful brown orbs from this little boy.”

 The man beside me speaks again, “I was here first! I am the one that has taken the time to paralyze this little boy! And the eyes – THE EYES! Why the eyes are the best part! So juicy, they just burst in your mouth like gushers. After dining on his tender meat, I will have the eyes as a last treat. So be gone Spider-Thing!” 

The spider-man crawls with inhuman speed towards the bed, then sinks each of its limbs into the tender regions of the man positioned next to my bed.

Mama died when I was a kid. I had no siblings. Daddy home-schooled me so I never got the chance to go out much. I was just your average nerdy fifteen-year-old girl. Pretty but not hot enough to command much attention besides on xBox Live or chat apps. Big glasses, long blonde hair, horrible fashion. Yeah, that was me. ""Just Jean.""

Dad and I lived outside Americus, Georgia. A cabin in the woods. Our only connection to civilization our kick-ass Wi-Fi.

Like me, dad was quiet. Not to mention awkward. He also wore oversized glasses.

I always wondered if mama was like us... but dad never talked about her. It was just us against the world.

Our love of shooting games helped daddy and I bond. Tonight, we had a new map. Something different than our usual abandoned factories or houses: a police station.

There we were dressed in camo. Our classes ready: dad with his assault rifle. Me with my AK-47.

The police station had bright lighting and many offices. Plenty of fun targets like water coolers and vending machines.

Much to our surprise, the map was fucking easy. The players didn't know what they were doing...

I heard the other team cuss. Not to mention scream.

Dad led us through the small map. Our onslaught left blood on the bland walls. Bodies piled up like fleshy furniture.

One enemy got close to me. But with the reflexes daddy taught me, I retrieved my knife and slit his throat open.

We got closer to an office in the very back. Our finish line. The body count now well over forty.

In that office, dad and I fired away at our last three enemies.

I only felt one shot hit me.

""Jean!"" dad screamed.

But that didn't stop me from emptying the clip.

When the smoke cleared, three blue bodies were sprawled out on the floor. One of the cop’s faces blown off.

Dad grabbed my shoulder. ""You alright?"" he asked in his gruff voice.

I grinned. ""Duh!”

Full of pride, I lifted up my camo shirt. Revealing the bulletproof vest. 

Dad hugged me close. ""You did great, sweetie."" He kissed the top of my head.

""You too,"" I said. 

Together, we walked through the station. Our pleased eyes scanned the battlefield.

We stepped out into the cold January night. Back to the abandoned parking lot. Back to our van.

Confidence buzzed within us. After all, we'd taken out the entire Cordele, Georgia police station.

On the way home, we began strategizing for our next map. This one was gonna be a little tougher: a city high school. The map was only available in the daytime! We'd have to be real prepared.

But deep down, all I knew was we'd play again. After all, it was us against the world. The high school map was gonna be our next battlefield real soon."

To cheer me up while I am stuck in my bedroom and that we need help around our house, my dad bought an android servant that is programmed to protect me since we lived in a dangerous city and to keep me company since I'm unable to visit friends. I named him Bobby. Both my dad and I love him but my stepmom is always looking uncomfortable around him. I understand that because there are people who are skeptical about advanced technology such as androids like Bobby.

When Bobby does the cooking, I'm starting to feel better day by day, in no time I know that I will soon be able to leave my house.

One evening my stepmom decides to make dinner instead, her food always tastes strange to me, I don't understand why my dad loves her cooking or why Bobby shouldn't do the cooking this time.

Suddenly Bobby took away my soup before I could put my spoon in it, stepmom turns to my dad and said ""You should call the agency, Bobby is malfunctioning,""

...that's when the android gently takes my spoon, dips it in my soup, holds it to my stepmom's face and said, ""Taste it,"""

At the last second, the car pulled back towards the highway. Might have fooled me in a quicker car. I picked up speed.

The car took the next exit. Foolish move. The road was rural and ice accumulated this time of year from the lack of traffic. A mile down the winding road, the car took a turn over a patch of ice, spun towards a snow bank, and crashed.

I parked and walked to the wrecked car holding my revolver by my side.

The car door opened and a short, scrawny teen wearing an elf costume fell into the snow. He scrambled towards a tree, but stopped when I fired a warning shot near his head.

“Hold it jingle pants, or the next one goes in your sugarplums,” I said.

“Don’t hurt me! Come on man! Please!”

He held his hands over his face, balled up in the snow, and whimpered.

“No hard feelings, I just want my daughter back,” I said.

“Wh-what?”

“My daughter. Your boss has her and I want her back.”

“Mr. Carrington? Santa’s Wonderland owner? Dude, I work part time as a stupid elf. Let me go man.” 

“I’m talking about your big boss up north. I know about the Motel 8 you’re staying at, and I know about the storage container out back.”

The whimpering and cowering stopped as though I flipped a switch. He rolled over, straightened, and grinned up at me.

“Then you know you’re headed to the naughty list. Your daughter made the list too. Lumps of coal don’t work on kids today; we have to make the punishments worse. Take those bad kids away. If you know about the container, then you know the portal doesn’t work for humans.”

———

The portal bit was a lie, and he was no teenager. I discovered the container used to transport naughty children days ago. The first elf I found filled his pants with hot cocoa when I forced him through the portal at gunpoint. We materialized in the workshop, facing Santa himself, surrounded by hundreds of angry elves. He wagged his finger and called me a very naughty boy. Odds were against me. Knowing that my daughter and I wouldn’t leave alive, I raised my gun at the fat man, intending to take my revenge. Santa ruined Christmas for the wrong family.

Santa gave a deep, hearty laugh and commanded his elves to relax. He led me to a table, and we shared milk and cookies as he told a story about a bad little elf and a way off the naughty list.

———

It was my turn to smile.

“Already been through the portal. Nice workshop. Santa says Merry Christmas.”

The elf’s eyes widened. My revolver sang a glorious carol as I decorated the surrounding snow with festive elf blood and brain matter.

And I was off the naughty list."

I move the pot. Now I have to wait. Five minutes and they’re runny, fifteen until they’re hard.

Mommy always says to eat them runny. Liquid orange-yellow yolks and gooey whites. She says to get big I need to eat them like that.

She says it’s the protein.

I wait and then I look into the pot. Yummy round brown eggs. I try to take them out but the hot water gives me an owie, so I use Mommy’s spoon to fish them out and put them into the bowl. Mommy’s put some ice in it, you know, before. She says the ice makes them easier to peel.

Chill them well, then peel the shell, Mommy says. She always makes up songs for me.

Sometimes we sing them together.

One of the eggs goes crack when I put it into the bowl. I’m glad I waited until they’re hard. Mommy wants me to eat them runny. But Mommy, runny eggs look like snot and I’m too old to eat snot. I don’t like it!

The eggs aren’t hot anymore so I take them out with my hands. The ice has all melted.

When the ice is melty, your eggs aren’t healthy, Mommy says.

But Mommy, I don’t like it when they’re hot!

I sit down. I’m just going to eat them with my hands. Mommy doesn’t like that, but you know what, Mommy? I’m going to do it anyway!

I look at the posters on the walls while I peel the eggs. I don’t like them. The naked men with the big muscles. The teenage boy bands. Mommy put them up. She said it was so I’d become like them. I always told her, I’ll never be like that, no matter how many eggs I eat, but she just told me to keep eating. She said that’s what she likes and don’t I want to be a pretty boy for her?

When I’ve eaten my eggs, I’ll take them all down! I’ll rip them into itsy bitsy tiny pieces! You won’t like that, Mommy, will you? Well, I’ll do it anyway!

Mommy sits on the couch and looks at me. Her eyes are big and empty, kind of like egg whites, except where the blood has run over them. The hammer still lies next to her and there’s blood all over the floor and she’s still wearing the icky pink nightie she likes that makes her look like a little girl.

Dress bold so you don't get old. That’s what Mommy says, but I just think it’s yuck, I just think yuck yuck yuck –

My hands are brown and sticky and shaking, I almost drop the eggs, but then I just say it over and over, chill them well then peel the shell, peel the shell chill them well peel the shell eat in hell peel the shell peel

I take a big bite."

He gripped the edge of his chair tightly. Trembling, he spoke.

“Bless me, father, for I have sinned.”

“Go on, my child.” Through the thin screen separating them, the priest could see an obscured face hanging low.

“So, father, I met this girl down at the bar a while back, her names Val, uh, Valerie. You know how it goes down, right? You slide onto the stool next to her, ask for two drinks and hit her up the best way you can. I mean, she’s great, tight body and real supple… anyway, we were seeing each other for a month before she started to smell.”

“Smell? Sounds rather crude, but what about it?”

“Call me crazy, father, but I’ve always known how to tell when a good man turns bad. It’s always difficult at the start, don’t get me wrong. It’s like when milk just begins to sour, you don’t catch the smell unless you look for it. But it always starts deep inside. A patch of rot grows right in the heart, and it spreads like cancer cells all throughout the body. Past a certain point, the smell of decay, god, it makes me gag.”

“Well, son, I’ve never heard anything like it before. I don’t know what this has to do with-“

“I’m getting there, father. I’m here to tell you I killed her.”

“This is not a joking matter.” 

“Who said I was?”

The priest looked outside the booth. The dimly lit church was empty. He was all alone.

“Why? How can you be sure that you’re not… you’re not…”

“Delusional? Oh, I wish I was, father. I was sixteen when I caught a whiff of it on my dad. He always cared for us, so nice and so gentle – the smell got worse and he nearly beat my mom to death. I smelled it on my kind old neighbour, and what do you know – the cops got him for doing things to little kids. It’s my gift, and I have to make use of it. I know I have to kill them before evil takes over and drives them to do worse.”

“But that can’t be the only way.” 

“Do you not shower yourself when you smell stink on your skin? Why won’t you pluck out the weeds before the garden becomes overgrown? There’s no other way, father. I’m sorry.”

A muffled pop split the air in two. The priest saw the fabric at his stomach darken and burn - two more pops sent him falling out of his chair and to the ground. 

“I saw you at mass last week, father. You were standing very close to me. Close enough to tell.”

“But I haven’t – I haven’t – done anything,” the priest choked, struggling to hold on to what was left of his breath.

“You were going to. Am I wrong?” the voice was now steely and cold. “There is no other way.”"

“Well, yesterday during the blizzard, something awful happened…” The woman trails off, grabbing a tissue from the provided box. The man nods, urging her to continue.

“I had left the house to grab the mail when I noticed that it was dark outside. It was only ten in the morning and it was pitch black out…” the woman coughs, “Anyway, the snow was coming down hard and the wind was blowing everywhere. As I stood at my mailbox, I saw something coming towards me in the snow. It was very tall, taller than any living creature I have ever seen. It was white and it blended in with the snow. I almost didn’t see it, except for its dark yellow eyes. I saw the eyes hovering in the air before I noticed its body.”

“What happened after you saw it?”

“I turned the flashlight on my phone on and saw blood everywhere. Blood outside my neighbors houses, in the streets, covering the…thing…I turned and ran inside of my house, and barricaded myself in a closet. That’s where I stayed until I was rescued by you,” the woman sniffles, reaching for another tissue.

“It was just a bear that you saw. It had rabies and ravished your town completely. You’re the only survivor,” the man said solemnly, taking a sip of his lukewarm coffee.

“I don’t think so…it was bigger than any bear that I’ve ever seen. Did you kill it?”

“Mr. White will take care of all of that,” the man stoops the recording and looks back, motioning for Mr. White to come in and take her.

“Are there any other survivors?” Mr. Grey pops his head in to ask after the woman has been escorted away.

“Of course not. She was the only one, well, not really. You know what happens to the survivors.

People were drinking, laughing, joking and generally having a good time but I wasn't having any of it. I had just seen my would be girlfriend and crush for several years go off into a private room with one of my close friends, red in the face and very clingy, so I was obviously not in the best of moods. My mind felt like it was being wrapped in cotton wool as someone offered me another drink. I tried to focus on his face. I don't really remember. It was just another person in the crowd. Just another stupid smile. I went outside to clear my mind and managed to gulp down some clean fresh air until I stumbled on the pavement and fell face first onto the concrete driveway.

I woke up lying on the floor of a pathway facing up at the stars. ""Ugh.."" I muttered as I tried to sit up and get my bearings. ""Wh-where am I?"" I managed to stutter as I stared around at the completely alien surroundings. It was all so fuzzy I couldn't focus on anything. I shook my head like a dog trying to get dry and quickly stood up thinking that I had to get home as quickly as I could. I felt so groggy and dirty and I just wanted to clear my head for a few seconds and relax. I stared around at everything and it seemed so surreal. I thought before that everything had looked fuzzy but everything actually was fuzzy. It was like the world had had its video quality lowered by a supreme deity trying to get it to load properly. Then it hit me. I must be in one of those lucid dreams everyone always talking about. I grinned and walked out of the little street I was in and back towards my house.

On the way someone bumped into me. I cant recall his face. Too fuzzy. Don't care. I was impatient and hungry so when he rammed into me I saw red. ""Hey man cant you look where you-"" I faltered as he looked back at me. I never could speak to people whilst making eye contact but I couldn't see his eyes this time. It was all so fuzzy. I bit down a gulp of air into my lungs as my heart accelerated. Then I took out the pocket knife I always carried and stabbed it right into his blurry neck. It was all a dream wasn't it? The man was on the floor gulping and wheezing in pain. I stabbed it into him again and saw red. Just red. So much red. Red all over me. Red on my clothes. Red.

Soon some blurry people arrived in blurry suits of blue and white. Then they were talking to me in blurry voices. Now I just see white. Not blurry. Just white. Me. White all around me."

“Excuse me?” Despite the violent nature of his words, his demeanor seemed the opposite. The strange man looked at me with a giddy smile as he leaned against the wall near the sink.

“Your heart. The big important organ in your chest, I’m gonna rip it out.” I peeked under the stalls and to my dismay, we were in the bathroom alone. Normally the mall is swamped with shoppers and there’s a line to the bathroom, but nobody was there now to witness him threatening me.

He was noticeably taller than me, but what intimidated me more was the fiery purple that flashed every so often in his otherwise grey eyes.

I inched towards the door and told him that if he got near me I’d be calling the police and screaming like a banshee out the door.

He laughed, “No need, just remember, your heart-” He patted his own chest with another smile, “I absolutely plan on ripping it out.” 

I dashed out of the bathroom and looked behind me as I left. He was simply gone. I waited around the stalls a bit and when I saw others go in before he came out, I went back to investigate. He had completely vanished.

This happened roughly five years ago but I still remember the encounter like it was yesterday. How could you forget an odd man in a bathroom threatening to rip your heart out? For those five years, I didn’t see the man again. I certainly wasn’t thinking about him when I was held at gunpoint outside of a local concert.

I gave him everything I had on me, but he still shot my friend Aaron and I anyways. Aaron didn’t even last long enough for the paramedics to arrive, but I barely clung to life as I was rushed to the nearest hospital. At some point in the ambulance, I passed out and only woke up later with the lead surgeon at my bedside.

He gave me a wistful smile, “Young man, you do not realize how lucky you are to be alive.” I was still sleepy, so I offered only a confused stare.

“Well, considering your blood type, where the bullet was lodged in your heart, and the amount of blood you lost, the fact that we found a donor in time to get you in surgery *and* keep you alive is nothing short of a miracle. Your friend wasn’t as lucky, I’m sorry, but as for you, you really beat the odds this time.”

His smile grew wider, “One more thing-”, he said as he reached into a cabinet and pulled out a jar stained in dark crimson. I could barely make out the veiny, dead human heart stuffed into the container. A purple hue flashed across the surgeon’s eyes as he winked and said, “I told you I’ll rip your fucking heart out.”"

Now, at the risk of worrying you, there are a few rules you need to follow here.  But just follow these simple rules and you’ll be fine.  
 

1. Ensure all rooms are kept tidy. Clean up promptly after a guest leaves, and check the room is in good condition the day before a guests arrival.  
 

2. Always start work smartly dressed and with good hygiene. You are the face of the establishment.  
 

3. Be deferential to guests, and answer requests politely and promptly. If a guest is aggressive, disruptive or otherwise hostile, leave and contact security rather then dealing with the issue personally.  
 

4. When it comes to room service, the policy of Gentle Point is...  
 

…  
 

I’m sorry, were you expecting something different? Maybe some areas off limits? Figures not to talk to, rituals to perform? Something like that?  
 

I fear you may have misunderstood the nature of our establishment.  
 

As long as your follow our policies, we don’t care if you enter whatever dark rooms and talk to whatever tall men in antiquated clothing you want. I’m sure you remember our policies, in the contract you signed.  
 

You *did* read it thoroughly before you signed, right? It says everything there, black and white. I’m sure you remember it.   
 

Or, put it this way. How much did you look around, when you arrived here? Perhaps you were looking for shadowy figures or occult glyphs, but did you look at how much security there was? Or did you wonder about our location, far from civilization? Did you think about how you’ve never met another person who worked here, never even heard the name, before you saw the job offer?  
 

 No. Of course you didn’t.    
 

If you’d *thought* about it, you wouldn’t be here  
 

So, like I said, welcome to your new life at the Gentle Point Hotel!  
 

And should you hear any strange noises at night or see shambling figures in the halls, well, you feel free to react however you see fit.  
 

There’s no set of rules that can save you now."

dygc3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dygc3u/the_maiden_of_the_lake/,The Maiden of the Lake,4,0,1574142824.0,"Let above be below. *Anwishta. Malonta. Cōda.*

They call me the High Sorceress; they might as well call this cliff the Supreme Pebble. They call you the Maiden of the Lake: a curious failure of the imagination. If it’s beautiful and in a lake, it must be a maiden. One wonders, if they knew what you are, *where* you are, whether they’d die of fright or go mad. *Anwishta. Malonta. Cōda.*

The Augres have come prepared, in moving forts, invulnerable to the storms that my father used to unleash upon them. The Augres want the Lake, the power it holds. The mountainfolk are disposable. Fair enough; they’d make rubbish slaves. The High Sorcerers could rule the mountains, but what’s the point. In a way, we already rule everywhere. *Anwishta. Malonta. Cōda.*

The elders know what the Augrian words mean. It’s novel, a woman saying them to the Maiden. I wouldn’t put it past those slobs to be titillated. The common mountainfolk are enjoying it like a conjuring trick. Wow! The Lake stopped reflecting the moon! Look closer, fools. Notice the stars. The ones in the Lake are not the same stars. *Anwishta. Malonta. Cōda.*

There you are. You have none of your fabled blue radiance: a heavy shape, barely visible. The mountainfolk take it as a bad sign. Is the Maiden dead? Oh, shut up. Not any deader than usual. I hear the echo now. The words are the babble of puffed-up men; I’ll change them next time. The echo is key. *Anwishta:* reveal yourself to me. *Malonta:* yield to me. *Cōda:* be mine.

The mountainfolk’s sorcerers, the old men who yell at clouds, are like carpenter ants trying actual carpentry. To summon a proper storm, you need to see a *lot* of sky at once. What’s above must be below. One last time: *Anwishta. Malonta. Cōda.* You deserve better words, Stepmother Earth, and so do I.

The world isn’t flat. The Maiden is not of the Lake; the Lake, *when* it’s a lake, is of the Maiden. If they knew the true size of things, and of the voids in between, they’d never sleep well again.

Storms are harder to summon out of dark air. The Augres are counting on that, too. What they’re not counting on is that I don’t have to see.

“Oh, of course,” a mountain girl said today, “you’re a woman, you can *feel.*” Such silliness. Isn’t it ironic; to come from a line of High Sorcerers who’d made their enchantment sound like a lewd proposition, and be the only one who’s ever bothered to study the Maiden’s anatomy.

&#x200B;

*Like armored lice, the Augres’ mountain tanks crawled slowly up the steep rocks, fearing neither lightning nor whirlwind nor hailstones. The sky had darkened slightly, but the moon and stars could still be seen.*

*“Those clouds are like pissing puppies! The half-breed bitch can’t even channel!”*

*“And she’s all that’s left of the renegades! We could walk up there in our pajamas!”*

*Then the earthquake hit.*"

I broke up with my girlfriend after I got back from a two week business trip early and came home to her cheating on me. After that I couldn’t get Depression out of my head or to be quiet. I slept less, my work suffered, and I was too tired to have a social life. Eventually my mind was so weak I decided to stop secluding myself and let Depression in.

I can’t really remember what happened after I did. I’ve been in the hospital for a week now. They said my ex found me lifeless when she tried to pick up some of her stuff. I had cuts everywhere and bruises around my neck like I tried to hang myself. 

The doctors brought me back and put me back together. They told me if I tried to do something like this again I would need a liver transplant from all the stuff in my system. The weird thing is i don’t have anything stronger than Advil in the house, so I wonder where it got it from. 

The good news is my ex is here, she’s been really comforting and helpful these past few days. Still though, anytime I look at her I can’t help but notice the tall ghastly figure behind her. I nicknamed it Depression because how can there be happiness when something like that exists."
dyfb07,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dyfb07/the_touch_of_death/,The Touch of Death,374,8,1574136954.0,"I was eight years old the first time I felt the touch of death.

Riding my bicycle down the sidewalk, I felt skeletal fingers, cold and spindly, grasp my heart. In my ears, I heard the banshee's silent song - a promise of emptiness and the void beyond. Terrified, I stopped, nearly falling off my bike, only to see a truck miss me by less than a yard and crash headfirst into a flowershop.

I felt death two more times in my life.

The first, I was at the airport, ready to fly back home for the holidays. Two steps before boarding my flight, death thrummed, clawing its vicelike fingers in my chest once more. Frozen with whispered visions of eternity, I collapsed on the spot. By the time paramedics resuscitated me, I found that the plane had already crashed - engine failure at 12,000 feet.

The second, I went to use the bathroom after a long shopping spree. Washing my hands, the familiar caress of death returned, my body turning cold with only my heartbeat thumping loudly in my ears. I reached out for the mirror, but froze in place before I touched it. I must have been a sight to behold, hunched over, knuckles tightly gripping the countertop and white from the strain, hand outstretched as if I were trying to clutch the last wisps of life.

After I recovered, I learned that I had dodged a shooting in the mall outside, less than a dozen yards away from where I stood. Once again, the touch of death had saved me.

I read once that people become fearless after brushing closely with death. It was certainly true in my case.

I took up rock climbing, skydiving, water skiing, a dozen other dangerous hobbies. It was exhilarating - the confidence from having felt death and survived made me free and careless.

If anything, that was my downfall. Strolling through a desolate park at midnight, I felt a blunt force strike me in the back of the head.

&#x200B;

When I came to, I was chained to a wall. A man - my kidnapper - loomed with his back to me, heating up a rusty saw until the teeth were red hot. Hearing my muffled cries, he turned around and smiled wide.

Excitedly, he spoke, ""Oh, we're going to have so much fun!""

It was only then I realized.

The only thing more terrifying than the touch of death is the absence of it."

Sometimes, the line between right and wrong can get blurry. Just knowing that you have the power to end a life can be invigorating. Holding the blade, I hesitate for a moment. I take a deep breath, and I do it. I feel the rush. I stitch up the cut.

The surgery's a success. The transplant went fine. The man's family thanks God, and his wife hugs me, sobbing. I pat her back and fake a smile. Well, it's not completely fake. The rush is still there.

Some time later, the man goes home. Everyone's happy, yada yada. But they don't know. To me, it's different. I need to hear the news, it's my heroin. I need it.

I get thanked a million times. I fake the same smile every time.

But there's something they don't know. In only a few months, it will happen. The parasite will hatch, and the feeding will begin. The man's organs will be eaten inside out, and he'll suffer every second of it. Eventually, he will die. I'll smile when I hear about it. I'll be smiling when a bunch of officers put me in the back of a car. I'll smile while I rot in prison.

I'll smile not only because of the man's death, but because I know there's more to come. See, this one man wasn't the only one. There's many others. And they'll hear the news too, it will be all over the Internet, all over TV. The doubt will grow in them. They'll ask themselves if I put it in them too. And deep down, they'll know I did. They'll have to prepare for their inevitable, painful death. Or they'll kill themselves. Either way, I'll be happy.

I wash my hands and look at myself in the mirror. Here comes another one.

So, next time you have that power in your hands, give it a shot. Take it from me, you'll love it. But before you do it, just to make sure your conscience is clean, ask yourself:

""Is it really wrong to kill?"""

I stood my ground as it ran towards us at high speeds, it had made a major mistake, it had come in too far and now we had it surrounded. I attacked its leg from the back bringing it down in no time at all time while all of us clambered onto it to finish it off as fast as possible. It was brutal.

There have been many times in which the outsiders have got in, but our numbers inside are vast…..there is only ever one fate for any that enter, no matter how ferocious they are….impending death.

Of course, its not always the case that the members within go unharmed, I have seen many of my close ones devoured time and time again…..but due to our immense efficiency, recovering is organised and without fail.  

The outsiders come in all forms, no one knows much about their origin. It is incredibly risky to venture out alone…..a standard supply route would be undertook everyday: I and a few others would exit our compound as a reconnaissance on the search for resources, food and also any materials that could potentially aid the survival of the group.  

It was not uncommon to lose members of the group outside the safe haven, however if necessary, it was a worthy sacrifice for the betterment of the others. Massive amounts of ground has to be covered to find any food most of the time and although there is plenty of passive life in nearly every direction…... the outsiders can be very hostile – so time spent outside must be minimal.

One day we had completed our normal supply route, bringing back all we could carry. Once all were inside we assumed it was safe but were rapidly alerted of an impeding attack due to movement spotted by the entrance.  

On the way out, as I and my team approached the entrance you could immediately tell the lack of light, as if blocked by something truly massive. Usually, as we leave for missions we are greeted with a warmth but this time nothing but a cold feeling of despair. The confidence in the team was still strong though, whatever was about to happen, we could take it...because we always did.  

“Here it comes” I was utterly focused, ready to protect all of my kind.

Before it entered, there was something that could be heard for a brief moment in the far distant reaches of the outside world:

“Honey where are you?”

I could barely hear it, yet sounded surreal.  

“Im out here mother, im nearly done” responded the child, while greatly focused on the task at hand.

“Be careful child its boiling, I know there are lots in that one but if you save some in the kettle ill make you a cup of tea afterwards”."

""You're boring, you never want to go anywhere. You're such a loser. It's your fault we never had any friends, "" was all she would nag me about.

I had to listen to the same bullshit my whole life. We loved each other once, maybe when we were kids. But when someone is stuck to you for so long you start to resent them. I was never able to have my own life. Whenever I tried to assert my own independence she was always there to nag me about it. 

Shelly was the attractive twin. She was everyone's favourite. She could light up a room with her smile. I myself wasn't much to look at, but one thing I had going for me was my fantastic figure and it drove Shelly mad that I was in control of it. 

Being twins me and Shelly had spent our entire lives together. I loved her with all my heart, but I just couldn't take anymore. All I wanted to do was live my own life and after bashing her brains in I finally got what I wanted. 

Shelly was starting to stink a bit and I was starting to worry about what kind of effect this would have on me. I hadn't really thought it through when I first hit her with the rolling pin.

I couldn't just cover her up and make excuses, the smell was enough of a giveaway. I couldn't say she just died or slipped and fell. In the end, I decided to just hand myself in and own up to my mistakes.

I covered my sister with a cloth and made my way to a police station. As I approached the counter the smell was enough to make the police officer on duty gag. 

""How may I help you? "" asked the officer as he wafted the air with his hand. 

""I killed my sister and I'm here to hand myself in, "" I said as the attention of the officer was now fully on me. 

""Where did this take place?"" He asked.

""At home where we live together.""

""And is her body still at the address? He asked looking at me as if I was mad.

""No, you're looking at it we share this body, "" I said as I removed the cloth covering Shelly my conjoined twins head.

The police officer fainted and last I heard he had to retire due to stress. The doctors didn't know what to do and In the end, they were afraid to remove her in case it killed me. It was safer to keep her head attached to my body. All I ever wanted was to be free of her and now I sit in a cell with nothing but her decomposed head perched on my shoulder laughing at me."

*My voice, when I start to speak, sounds hypnotic even to my own ears. The old man seated in front of me can’t take his attention off me, I’m sure.* 

“Remember when the villagers came to my home? Thirty of them, against one helpless girl. All I ever did was sell herbs when they were sick, try to take care of wild beasts they hurt and… maybe, I suppose, refuse the advances of the burgmeister’s son. 

They killed my cat, you know. Sweet old ball of fur that stumbled to their feet meowing for a scratch; I cried when one of them brought his axe down on his head. It wasn’t even a black one. From this moment on, I felt numb. Happily so! The trip back to the village, chained, being spit on and called names, many names…

And the rocks. They came flying, but they hesitated. What if one of them hit me? What if my vengeance singled him out in the crowd? I suppose… they really were scared of me.

Well, most of them. Not the ones who tried to enter my cell at night. The numbness left me when I heard them laughing, trying to open my cage, telling me all the horrible things they would do to me and how… how I would like it, since… the Devil would’ve had done it to me already. 

But you were there. You protected me. *Even a witch*, you said*, has the right to decency. You will go no further*. They measured you up, three to one, saw your sword, glanced at your face. And they gave up. 

You were strong beyond your years. With the strength that comes from absolute, devout faith. You did not flinch when your men lit the fire under me. You did not laugh or spit or screech like all the others. You looked at me with confidence, pity and the absolute certainty to do the right thing. 

Did you see it? 

The entity that came to me as I was naught but pure agony? 

It offered me a wordless deal, and I accepted. It laughed, reaped my… soul? Being? Out of my burning body and shoved part of it in the tiny corpse of a child, just born cold and dead. 

The babe cried out. The mother sagged with relief and thanked God. Wrong guess. 

He took my soul. Which means my mortality, my capacity to love, my empathy. Only thing it left me, beside my new powers, are my memories.”

*I lift my head up and look at him. In my hand, the iron rod grows hot.* 

“So. I could pretend I do this so you won’t torture another. But we both know it wouldn’t be true.”

dy5kxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dy5kxp/for_the_children/,For the Children,133,12,1574095081.0,"It had been a harsh year for the town, every day the war drew closer like an arrowhead to its target. 

But that fact alone could not break the spirit of the people. After all, their traditions had survived for decades if not centuries before. You see, the town was surrounded by wild turkeys and every year the townsfolk would celebrate with a hunt. The hunt would conclude with the capture of the largest turkey, which would then be killed and turned into a teddy bear like effigy. 

While the turkeys had become increasingly sparse and rare, this year was no different. 

The horn made its jubilant yell and the largest turkey was caught, unfeathered, reshaped, seasoned well and then finally, cooked. 

The mayor spoke first,

“May we continue to share this bountiful feast, if not for us and our ancestors then for the children!” 

Shortly afterwards, the kids were allowed the first chunks of the teddy bears made out of turkey. After subsisting on government rations, the children were ravenous. The adults looked on happily, themselves eating from plates covered in a mix of rations and homegrown vegetables. 

The first to eat began to choke, their guttural calls for help unable to bleed through the foam. Soon enough, the rest began to collapse and shake before a violent death. 

Some realized that this was the product of the war but by then its ephemeral tendrils had already filled their stomachs with poison. 

Around midnight, soldiers entered the town and slaughtered any survivors despite delirious pleas for help. They moved on just as quickly, the end of the war glistening in their starving eyes. 

By the start of the next day, only the dead greeted the midwinter sun."

The sun was setting, but it wasn't quite dark enough for the street lights to turn on yet. This park had a large, open field with lots of big trees. The shadows they could cast were like tents of darkness. 

Off in the distance, underneath one of the trees, I saw what looked like movement from a lot of people. At first I thought it was people playing sports, but they were oddly too quiet. As I approached them, I found it was a group of around 10 children, all standing in a circle. The darkness from the overhead tree concealed most of their faces, but it was clear enough to see they were all glaring, and their eyes were focused on this girl in the center. 

She had brunette bangs covering most of her face, and she was squeezing her legs to her body as she nervously rocked back and forth. I took a few steps closer, and she quickly looked in my direction. Like a domino effect, all the other kids turned towards me, too.

""L-L-Leave her alone!"" I demanded. 

Immediately they all pulled out small knives. Then, while continuing to glare at me, they all spoke in unison, ""Don't tell me what do. Don't tell me what to do."" They kept chanting that phrase while walking towards me. ""Don't tell me what to do!""

I instinctively backed away and was ready to run for my life. But after getting ready to turn around, the girl with bangs shouted, ""Don't leave me here! Please!"" 

The kids started sprinting towards me with their knives pointed in my direction. I ran a short circle around them so I could scoop up the girl and make a break for it. They were only a handful of steps out of reach, and one of them managed to slash my pants leg around the ankle. Once I was near the street they started giving up the chase, and I ran father into the neighborhood until I was out of sight. 

Once it was safe to catch my breath, I rested on the sidewalk with the girl. She kept clinging to my shirt, trembling as she pressed her face against my stomach. An overhead streetlight turned on, and the light revealed parts of pale, dirt-covered face.

""It's not fair to hurt people because they're different,"" she whimpered."" ""It's not my fault I can't be like them. Why should I be hurt for that?""

With tears streaming from her face, she looked up at me. The overhead light had cast a glint on her...red eyes. 

""Y..You're not human...are you?"" 

She leaned towards my ear and whispered, ""No. And soon you won't be either. I'm sorry."""

Grandma’s #1 rule at her house was to never touch her lemon tree. Of course, as all 12-year olds do, I decided one day to break the rule because it seemed stupid and unnecessary. It’s not like I was going to do anything bad to it.

I snuck out and simply put my hand on it. She must have been watching, because she was instantly outside yelling at me, hauling me to her bedroom, and screaming at Grandpa how I needed to be punished. Grandpa restrained me while Grandma used belts to tie my limbs to the bedpost. 

This was when I became terrified but my attempts to break free were futile. Grandma left the room and I could hear the door open and close twice within just a few minutes. She returned with a basket of lemons, muttering about how she’ll teach me not to mess with her precious lemons.

She also had a knife, which she used to cut each of the lemons evenly in half. Grandpa bowed his head and quietly left the room as Grandma forced my left eyelids open. She squeezed one, two, three, drops of juice in my eye. I whelped and tears began a downpour across my cheek. This only seemed to anger Grandma as she squeezed a light stream into the next eye.

Next, she made ten slits with the knife - already adorned in the juice - across the surface of each of my arms. Blood created a road map across my triceps and I began to shake and feel queasy from the pain. Grandma grabbed four more lemon halves and expunged fresh juice onto all the gashes, at which point my breathing became even quicker and more labored.

She finished the punishment by squeezing more juice into a puddle on her nightstand and using that puddle to fill a turkey baster. She then tilted my head and up and shot it down my nostrils. My whole head felt like it was burning from the inside out as she undid my restraints. 

***“Be careful next time, I won’t go easy again”,*** she sneered as she left the room. I stayed curled up shaking and crying until my Mom came to pick me up, at which point I zoomed past Grandma out the door crying to her and showing her what happened.

She returned only a small frown and pulled back the skin around her lips. It revealed damaged skin and messy stitches where her wisdom teeth would’ve been. Her tongue lifted upwards to reveal more stitchwork. She let go of her lips and told me:

***“Wow, she really did go easy on you.”***"

Is it possible to conjure up anything more terrifying than the idea of having an evil old hag, brimming with enormous hate and vitriol dominating your sleep with malevolent intent? Certainly not, but this is the horrendously sinister reality for sufferers of the hideous phenomenon known as sleep paralysis. 

According to those who have been subjected to the “night hag”, the sense of pure evil accompanies her into the room just before she begins the ritual of climbing on top of her victim. One such account tells of a young woman who was visited regularly by the “night hag” from the tender age of just four years old, up until she reached her teenage years. The sufferer explained how she would hear the unmistakable sound of the “night hag” laughing or ‘cackling’ in the most unnervingly high pitch as she approached her bedroom door. The hag would then run through the door, laughing emphatically as the victim lay there, transfixed with pure terror, unable to move a muscle. The hag would then proceed to climb on top of the unfortunate girl and sit on her chest; her dark, decaying soulless eyes studying her victim, revelling in the sensation of the victim’s heart beating ten to the dozen. The hag would then begin tickling the girl, all the while howling with laughter at the mental anguish she was unleashing. The “night hag” seemed to genuinely relish the idea of this woman living in fear; fear of the day ahead where she would have to try to convince doubters of the horrors she had witnessed, but a heightened fear of this happening again the next night; the knowing of what was in store, lying in wait for her, the heart-stopping moment of seeing the hag running through the door again to resume her campaign of hatred and loathing. The victim remains adamant that the hag was very real and recounts the brutal force applied by the hag each time she pinned her to the bed. 

Eventually, the time came when the victim could take no more and made the brave decision to be proactive in putting an end to the hag’s frequent visits; she would try to fight back. That night, the girl willed the hag to visit in the same way she always did, only this time, the sufferer confronted her and threw hard, angry punches at the hag, her body hurting in its paralysed state, she drew on every last ounce of energy, of will within her. The victim recalls praying as she did this; determined, genuine prayer for help to banish this thing that had plagued her, controlled her life from such a young age and by some miracle, it worked; the hag would never return to her again, as the victim had broken her fear and the hag had been thriving on, relying on this pure fear as her reason to exist."

Tonight’s forecast called for heavy storms, which Karina found soothing. She was cozied up on the chaise of the sofa with Arlow, her cocker spaniel. He was sleeping and snoring up a storm, no pun intended. All of a sudden, the doorbell rang, and he went nuts. “It’s just the door, Arlow.” she said. She threw the blanket off of her and got up. She walked down the hall, approached the front door, and looked through the peep-hole. “Who’s there?” she said. Turning on the porch light, she saw nothing, so she opened the door. The wind threw the door out of her hands. She walked out onto the porch. There was noone out there. Just the trees whipping around as if they were trying to shake every leaf off of their branches. The wind was strong and frigid.


Karina closed the door and locked it. Everything in the house was dead silent until she heard Arlow barking. Oddly enough, he wasn’t barking at this door anymore. She turned the corner to find the back door wide open. “What the hell?” She thought to herself. She made a habit of locking all the doors after 9pm, so she knew she locked the back door. She slowly walked over to the door and quickly glanced outside. When she went to shut the door, Arlow darted past her. “Arlow!” She shouted. He ran down the stairs and into the darkness of the woods bordering her home.


She stepped through the doorway and walked to the edge of the steps. There was no way she was going to find him in the pitch black forest.  Suddenly, the back door slammed shut behind her, and every light in the house went out. She grabbed the doorknob and tried her damndest to turn it, to no avail. She was locked out, it was freezing outside, and now she had gone from nervous to terrified.


The trees rustled and creaked in the ruthless wind. It began storming. With no way to get back into the house, Karina sat against the back door facing the woods. After a half hour of sitting in the freezing cold, she heard a squeaking noise. She squinted her eyes to try and adjust to the darkness. On the next flash of lightning, she saw the silhouette of a man standing at the edge of the forest. Startled, she stood up quickly. “Hello?” She shouted. Then, without warning, Arlow came running up the steps. He was soaking wet and whining. She picked him up and held him tight. Lightning flashed once again and the silhouette was gone. All of the sudden, the back door opened on its own. She walked inside, greeted by the warmth and comfort of her home. The lights weren’t on, but it was better than being outside. She locked the back door, turned around, and as the lightning flashed once more, behind her stood a pitch black silhouette. "

dxs3zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dxs3zt/theres_a_psychopath_at_my_work/,There's a Psychopath at my Work,443,8,1574022841.0,"I knew there was something odd about David when I first saw him. He was a handsome guy, tall, with an athletic build. The type of guy who seemed to charm everyone.

Everyone seemed to like him. He was kind and witty, and people just seemed to gravitate to him. The charade he put on was convincing, but somehow, I saw through it.

There was just something about him that set me on edge each and every time I interacted with him. Maybe it was a sixth sense, but I always got the feeling he was hiding something. 

My suspicion was strengthened when I randomly caught him arriving to work one day. He closed his trunk as I pulled in, and used a water bottle to wash a red liquid from his hands. 

I greeted him as usual, but that moment I knew for sure he was up to something nefarious. Later that week, he was alone in the lunchroom and didn’t see me come in. I then caught a glimpse of what he was reading on his phone.

‘Effects of Rohypnol’. 

It’s not a crime to just look something up, but given the context I found it extremely unnerving. That moment substantiated everything I had sensed from him, but rather than notify the police, I elected for a different option. 

I borrowed a friend’s car so he wouldn’t recognize me, and followed him when he clocked out on Friday. He returned to his apartment, and didn’t leave for the rest of the night. I staked out in the parking lot for the entire night.

The following day he finally emerged and went to his car; carrying a large duffel bag with him. I tailed him the rest of the day as he made several stops at local hardware and convenience stores.  

Later that night, I followed him to a local bar and posted up outside as he went in. He returned two hours later with a friend. It was a young woman, and from her stumbling footsteps it was clear she wasn’t in the right state of mind.

My heart began thundering in my chest, and I stepped out of the car just as he put the young woman in his back seat. He didn’t even see me sneaking up, and before he could turn back, I slammed my bat into the back of his head. 

He fell to the ground, conscious but dazed beyond belief. After taking a brief look around, I dragged him to the trunk and forced him in. He looked up, seeming to recognize me. I just smiled and spoke.

“What are the odds huh? Two psychopaths in the same place at once.” His eyes sprung wide open as I wrapped him in duct tape and closed the trunk. His lady friend was out cold in the back seat. I got in the driver’s seat and fired it up as my smile grew even wider.

“A two for one, must be my lucky day.”"
dxqmkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dxqmkq/the_radio_waves_from_titan/,The Radio Waves from Titan,6,2,1574016735.0,"The lone *ESF Alison* floated gently between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, drifting intently to Titan. Their mission: explore the unknown radio waves emitting from Saturn’s moon. It had been several Earth months, but the trip was well worth it. Back home, the crew’s spouses and children would hear of their grand discovery. New lifeforms, environments, terraforming potential - all revealed to the human race.

There had been some complications among the way. An occasional panel or wiring would be damaged by the cold, harsh existence of space. But the crew’s mechanics - Hank and Lisa - would always be able to diagnose and fix the problem.

So it was no surprise that as the *Alison* began to enter Saturn’s gravitational field it whirred and clicked to signal distress on an outer-ring. Hank and Lisa always drew straws. Hank thought about his childhood as he drew the shortest one, remembering the similar situations he had as a boy.

One night in particular was remembered fondly. Hank and the neighborhood boys had all drawn straws to see who would cross through the forest to see what resided beyond those dark trees. Hank had lost (or maybe won?), nervously pushing past those woods, revealing a large field. And in that field Hank looked up to see those beautiful stars and galaxies strewn across the sky. In that moment, Hank knew space was his calling. He knew he wanted to be among the stars.

Hank strapped on his suit, ensured his oxygen levels were more than enough, and checked his tether. Sturdy. Jokingly, he told the others to watch him close, as he would beat Lisa’s previous time. Lisa remarked back, then opened the pod doors. Hank began to float, at first in place, but then towards the source of the alert messages.

Back in the cockpit Lisa and Mark talked about Titan. How before they left Earth, Titan had sent out bizarre, uncodable fragments of what was assumed to be intelligent life. It had taken the ESF a few years to build the *Alison* and its departure was one of great reverence. 

Mark wondered about the radio signals. How they seemed to be repetitive. And short. Repetitive and short. He thought about the silence of space, the coldness, and the uncertainty of it all. It would be a matter of time now before they saw Titan, eventually revealing the radio wave’s masters.

“Hank how’s the repair going?”

…

“Hank?”

…

No response.

“Hank, respond now.”

In one of the cameras: a blip.

“Oh my God,” Lisa muttered.

Mark tilted his head and squinted. Then his blood ran cold.

Hank was flailing in the darkness. His line somehow cut from the ship. In that cold, awful blackness Hank’s white, flailing figure grew smaller and smaller.

The alert signal continued flashing red spouting *beep! Beep!*; the only sound Mark or Lisa could hear as they watched Hank disappear."

Just as I shift my weight toward him, I hear the front door close.

""Shit. Oh shit. I knew you should have left.""

Ryan looks desperate.

""Honey, I'm home!"" I look under the bed, to see if he can possibly hide there. It's too small.

""Honey? Is everything alright""

""Yeah, Will! Everything's fine!"" I shout back.

""I'm going upstairs!""

Fuck. Maybe the closet? I open it. Not possible.

""Honey what...?"" William doesn't finish the phrase. He looks at Ryan, who's about half his size. He looks disappointed for a few seconds.

He makes a poker face and walks toward the closet. He reaches for the top and grabs something.

""Jesus Christ,"" Ryan says as Will pulls out the pistol from the top of the closet.

Will loads the gun. He whistles a happy tune as he does it. I cover my face with my hands to not see what he'll do to Ryan, but I can still see from the spaces between my fingers. Suddenly, William takes out his phone from his pocket and dials a number. Three digits. He calls and puts the gun's barrel to Ryan's forehead. He puts a finger to his mouth and makes a shushing sound. Tears stream from my face. I lower my hands and put them together to pray.

""Hello? Police? There's someone in my house. I can hear him threatening my wife. I think he has a gun!"" He says with a shaky voice. His face remains as indifferent as ever. ""Please get here quickly, I think he'll hurt her. Can you see my location using my phone? Ok, good. Please send someone.""

I silently pray he doesn't shoot Ryan. He hangs up the phone, looks at it, and smashes it against the wall. It shatters. He looks angry now. The pressure of the barrel is making Ryan's forehead turn red. Ryan has his eyes closed.

William takes a few steps back and puts the gun to his head."

When I looked into her eyes the first time, I knew we were kindred spirits. 
That first night, we walked hand in hand through Central Park, talking and laughing the entire time. Afterwards, we grabbed a bite to eat and went back to my place. She made herself at home in my apartment while I carried in our dinner. I thought it would be romantic if we ate on the floor, so I spread a large sheet of plastic down in front of sofa. 

“I’m starving,” she said licking her lips. She had the most beautiful fangs I had ever seen. 

I bared the neck of the young man, bound and gagged on the floor.  “Ladies first.”

So ravenous was she, that for a moment, I thought she was going to drain him dry. She looked at me with a sheepish grin and wiped her crimson mouth with the back of her hand.

“May I?” I said. She nodded and I partook of the first of many meals we would share together.

Tonight is our last night in this apartment. The neighbors are growing suspicious so it’s time to move on. We look at each other and smile as we remember all the good times we’ve had here together. There would be many, many more good times, thanks to Tinder. We were a perfect match and we would be together forever."
dxptnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dxptnc/wedding_day/,Wedding Day,191,11,1574013247.0,"Bridget had wanted a big wedding her entire life… 

That special day with everybody from her school, her street, her old job and her church could attend & celebrate her - *Bridget for a change.* 

Bridget was twirling in front of the mirror in her long flowing custom made gown. The long white train at the back sat heavy on the floor. Much too heavy to carry alone. 

She was waiting for her mother to arrive and carry the train down the aisle. Her mother, the only guest of the day besides her and Mark - like she said, it would have to be big on spirit and not on guests. 

The legalities of the affair could be dealt with after (the witnesses, the certificates, the registry-office) - all Bridget today wanted was the spirit of the wedding to be complete - as the mother that raised her alone; walked her down the aisle and Mark, the love of her life, handsome in his black tuxedo, smiling at the approaching princess. 

It was all a surprise to Gail as she entered to see her daughter all in white. 

“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner mother but today is finally the day.” Bridget said beaming from her dress. 

“What are you talking about?” Gail said. 

“The day I marry Mark, here, with you… in this house.” Bridget said. 

Gail had been humouring Bridget’s eccentricities for the past year but an impromptu, cowboy wedding was the strangest moment yet… And Gail could feel the dread rise in within the pit of her stomach - *not again.* 

“Honey, where is Mark?” 

“He’s waiting for me in the garden of course. He can’t see me before the day. He’s under the special gazebo I made.” 

“Good.” Gail said mediating to her daughter’s impulsivity. “Do you want me to walk you to him.” 

“Would you mother? Would you please? I wrote our own vows. Hold my train.” 

Bridget was holding the crumpled vows in her hand. 

Gail held the train of the dress from behind and as they walked through the living-room. Gail was taken aback by the amount of crap she’d been collecting and had left cluttering up this small house - *she’s hoarding again*. A cloud of dust rose from the floor as the dress gently tickled the rotting floorboards. Under the gazebo was Mark, posed in a deck-chair with a Tuxedo scruffily thrown over his limp body. There wasn’t a 'smile', there wasn’t the husbandry joy a groom has for his bride, there wasn’t even a look of recognition… Mark was impassive - *deathly impassive.* 

“Oh, honey.” Gail said. “You have to stop going into the cemetery and digging this man up.""

The tears welled for Bridget as the delusion of the happiest day of her life dissipated into reality. 

“But he was my fiancee.” Bridget said - her voice wobbly, “look how happy he is.” 

Mark’s ‘smile’ had decomposed; as the skin had rotted down to bare teeth."

She screams something back. I am not sure either of us heard what the other said.  I grab her hand and pull her close.


A silvery shimmering glint from thousands of feet below greet my eyes.  Towards the horizon I am blinded by the fiery orb's descent. To be honest, the view is spectacular.  Nothing beats a Hawaiian sunset. The ocean rushes towards us.

“Yeah, Katie, I know,” Andi whispered huffily.

“Then get in there!” Katie said, shoving Andi towards the bathroom.

“Alright already, god!”

Andi walked inside and closed the door, ignoring the giggles of the girls outside. She shook her head and walked over to the sink.

This was so dumb. She didn’t even want to be here, but her mom and Katie’s were close friends, so she always had to accept whatever birthday or slumber party invitation Katie was forced to extend. And now here she was, at yet another sleepover, playing Katie’s newest obsession: summoning the Shadowman.

Andi wasn’t sure what the difference was between the Shadowman, CandyMan, or any other spirit summoned through a mirror. Probably nothing. She sighed and turned off the lights, lighting the candle.

“Ready!”

The giggling outside intensified before slowly quieting down. Then the chanting started.

“Shadowman, Shadowman, he hates the day. Shadowman, Shadowman, come out and play!”

As each verse ended their voices grew louder, more expectant. Andi began counting. They were supposed to chant four times and then knock, inviting the Shadowman in. That was the theory, anyway.

“Shadowman, Shadowman, he hates the day!”

They were almost yelling now. Andi gripped the candle and waited. One more verse to go. Despite herself, she was actually growing nervous. She knew it was nonsense, but standing in the dark, looking at her wide-eyed reflection distorted by the flame, Andi felt a shiver run down her spine.

“Shadowman, Shadowman! COME OUT AND PLAY!” the girls finished, before there was a loud knock on the door.

Andi held her breath and waited. Outside was completely silent. She leaned forward a bit as the candle wavered. Surely that was just her imagination...?

Another knock rang through the bathroom. Andi yelped and jumped back. Now the knocks were more like bangs, quick and insistent. Dropping the candle, Andi began to twist the door handle, but it was no use: it wouldn’t open.

“Guys, this isn’t funny! Let me out!!!” Andi begged, trying to fight back tears.

A pair of hands reached out from behind and grabbed her. Andi screamed, throwing all her weight against the door, crashing out to raucous laughter. Scared and confused, she looked behind her to see Nell doubled over in stitches, the shower curtain flung wide open from where she had been hiding.

“That’s not funny!” Andi shouted, pushing away from everyone.

“Oh come on, don’t wet yourself,” Katie chuckled. “Besides, you should’ve seen your face—priceless!”

Andi stopped, her shoulders hunched, shivering. The other girls brushed past her back to the living room, unconcerned. As Katie walked by she glanced over at Andi and stopped. She was smiling...but it was more of a grimace than a smile.

“Andi? No hard feelings, yeah?” Katie said nervously.

A shadow passed over Andi’s face as she looked up into Katie’s eyes. “Of course not...now come on. Let’s go play.”"

""This song is the bee's knees, ain't it?"" Elizabeth said as she turned off the radio, turning down the dial all the way. She and her brother were preparing for school in the morning.

""You take this book and keep it for me for the day, got it?"" instructed big brother Anthony. Elizabeth took the thin paper book and headed out for the bus. Every morning she saw airplanes flying day in and day out. She knew there was a war going on, but didn't know much about it as she was just a kid.

On the bus, Elizabeth drew on the back of the back of the book. It was a few pages of blue paper, which looked like a small workbook full of grids. She couldn't read yet, so she didn't know what the book was about. Using her school pencil, Elizabeth drew a horse and a barn while waiting for her stop.

While stepping off the bus, Elizabeth saw a portly man selling balloons. They were as bright as a button and bobbed around high up in the sky. They looked like a great deal of fun to the girl. ""You look like you could use some smiles, young tot,"" said the man with the balloons. ""One penny per balloon.""

Elizabeth sadly replied, ""I haven't any money."" She turned away sadly, until the seller spied the book she was holding.

""Hold on there, I'll trade ya two balloons if you hand over that book. Two balloons for that little thing is a straight-up bargain, I reckon!"" Elizabeth thought that made sense. Two was indeed more than one. The man smiled as she handed him the book, and handed her two balloons like he promised. She happily took one balloon in each hand and skipped to school.

In the evening, Elizabeth walked home smiling ear to ear. She let the bright yellow and red balloons bounce against each other as she climbed the stairs to her room. Anthony was back from school as well. ""I need to go to the store for food, can I have my book back? I didn't want someone swiping it during school.""

Elizabeth forgot all about Anthony letting her borrow the book. She sheepishly explained ""Well, a man wanted to trade it for these big balloons. Aren't they fun though, Anthony? Anthony?"" He was quickly steaming mad, with his face bunching up.

""That was our ration book so we could get food from the store! Do you know what you've done? We got no food all week!"" Elizabeth gasped as she came to the realization of what the book was for. She saw it a few times at the store but didn't figure out its purpose.

""S-s-sorry..."" said Elizabeth apologetically. Anthony rolled up his sleeve and Elizabeth backed up in fear. She hated this part whenever she was in trouble or Anthony was mad.

Elizabeth cried in her pillow, tears rolling down her face. She dreaded that there wouldn't be much food for her this week. But even worse, her side had an awful pain in it."

What you didn't anticipate, however, was the Creatures. 

You quickly realized that the locals hardly seemed to be aware of the Creatures, even though there were old signs on the sides of the roadway warning you to watch out for them because they were present in the area. You caught your first glimpse of a Creature the other night while driving, a four legged beast with brown fur and glowing green eyes. However, the most distinct feature was certainly the curved, sharpened spikes that grew out of its skull and branched in many directions. The Creature showed no fear of your vehicle flying past it; it simply stared at you, unmoving, and watched as you accelerated to get as much distance as possible from it. 

Why do the locals not flee from the area? There are signs all along the roadways telling you to watch for them, signs saying they're near, signs telling you to use caution and be alert. Yet the locals do nothing. They simply go about their day, seemingly unaware of the Creatures, as if they're under a spell that causes them to exist blindly. 

Tonight, against all logic, you decided to venture from home to go into town and buy some essentials from the market. It was dark early this time of year; the sun had already been set for several hours, and a chilly fog had rolled across the area. As you drove along, trying to ignore the feelings that you were being watched, you turned a sharp curve and slammed on your brakes when you saw what was in the street in front of you. Half a dozen Creatures stood blocking roadway ahead, unmoving, watching you with those huge green eyes that never blinked. As you come to a halt, you know deep down that the Creatures are already planning on impaling you with their skull spikes and then doing... who knows what? Do they eat their victims? Toy with them? The signs never specified. 

You prepare for your end as the Creatures continue to watch you, and with a stroke of irony you notice another warning sign. This electronic display sign shows the same warning as all of the others, and illuminates the fog in front of it with the same words:

dxebzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dxebzu/homo_homini_lupus/,Homo Homini Lupus,10,0,1573945756.0,"When I mentioned lycanthropy, Mr Wexley protested exactly as I had anticipated; namely, that no single popular superstition had been as thoroughly discredited by the scientific knowledge of civilised men of the 19th century.

The belief in werewolves, he argued, makes no essential claims in either the metaphysical realm of the unknowable (as e.g. fate-belief does) or the empirical realm of the unverifiable (as e.g. ghost-belief does). It is merely a tale of precipitous transmutation of living flesh which we know beyond any doubt to be biologically impossible.

I dwelt only briefly on the metaphysical possibility that the natural constraints of our world are an elaborate deception, a Platonic cave, in which werewolves are a recurrent intrusion from an extrinsic world wherein preternatural happenings are mundane. Then I laid out in detail my real, empirical theory of lycanthropy, drawing on the ideas of Linnaeus and Darwin before recounting my grim personal experience with the phenomenon.

I took pains not to appear accusatory. Mr Wexley, being of an imaginative turn of mind, seemed especially intrigued by the significance of the plenilune. Our mutual rapport made it easier for him to accept that there might be an aspect to his nature of which he was unaware. When I proposed a *demonstratio ad oculos,* his only misgivings pertained to the prospect of Mrs Wexley calling him to account for his nocturnal absence.

He even agreed to be restrained during our experiment, lest the shock of my transformation should drive him to extremes that were, alas, very familiar to me. I left his hands untied and posed for him so that he could sketch the creature. It struck me as being more simian than lupine, but that might be attributable to Mr Wexley’s unsteady hand or the influence of my theory.

A compassionate man of deep moral principle, he asked to be “bitten” (sic); I would never put that burden upon him even if the werewolf’s bite were not pure superstition.

My lycanthropy manifested itself spontaneously at the age of fourteen. My theory is that the full moon was the optimal time for one tribe of primordial men to attack another. Hallucinating lupine creatures in the place of men of the other tribe, and lupine howls in the place of their coherent speech, presented, in Darwinian parlance, an “evolutionary advantage”. As a result, mankind consists overwhelmingly (or perhaps entirely) of descendants of that original tribe of werewolf-seers. Eagerly and without scruple, they had obliterated the phantasmal monsters, who were in fact men of more distant kin.

What misalignment, what atavism in me is causing me to be seen as a lycanthrope every full moon, I cannot fathom. Were it not for kind souls such as Mr Wexley, I should long have despaired of existence. For although I am always human in my own eyes, I am both a “werewolf” and a werewolf-seer. I have glimpsed cowering moonlit silhouettes of my fellow outcasts and heard their fearful howls. I, too, immediately loathed those flea-ridden beasts."

 Most of the time, you’re alone on the road. Sometimes there’s another car driving behind you, seeming to take the same turns every time. If you turn your blinker on, so do they, even if there’s nowhere to turn. Sometimes the car is visible from the side mirrors, but if you look into your rear view mirror, you only see empty road behind you. They are easy to evade, though. Just turn your signal on - it will do the same - and on the next crossroads, turn the other way. The car will turn the way it was signaling.

 Most of them aren’t cars. Sometimes you see a deer crossing the road, but it has too many legs. Sometimes you see a man dressed like a construction worker, standing on the side of the road at 3 am, alone, with no sign of road work being done anywhere around. Sometimes a large roadkill you just drove by simply gets up and walks away.

I knelt down next to one of the hostages, he was still frozen in fear.

That's all I see, now. I don't know where I am, and something inside of me says I don't want to. 

I want to be home. 

Gradually light trickles into my vision--little flying dots that coagulate like a benevolent cancer--and with it memories. First of a month past, then the events of this last week, and finally, today. I remember the letter at my door--signed with the president's signature. It was imploring, almost desperate. The Soviets were far ahead, after all. 


The next few days were tumultuous, to say the least. My country needed me now more than ever before, and still I hesitated. My patriotism, though deeply rooted, isn't--wasn't--self-destructive. I played monkey in the middle with the pleading words of my nation and the distraught faces of my wife and kids for a week, and then I sent my reply, directly to the president, as I had been instructed. 


It was all frills from there, really. Within two weeks we were ready for disembarkation. All the space program's resources were diverted to my mission. This was our last shot. We didn't have time for further recruitment, so I would be going alone. 


Takeoff was relatively uneventful. I said my last tearful goodbyes, saluted Mr. Nixon, who had attended along with thousands of spectators from all across the nation. I tried my best to relax and watched as the blue sky speckled with white faded to star-scattered black. 


Then the bang. It was indescribable. I was like a quarter being tossed around inside a giant tin can as the report of the world's most unfathomable cannon shattered my skull. Then abruptly, dark, and silence. 


The construction of the spacecraft was rushed. There must have been a fatal flaw somewhere, an oddity in the construction. I can hear a hiss coming from the back wall of the cabin. The radio's fried beyond repair. 
Just before the light left I could hear the voice of the director: ""Ground control to Major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong."" 


***


I wait. How long it'll be, I don't know. The hissing's grown louder than before. It sounds almost like a growl now, and I can feel my ears popping and my breaths shortening. There's a pressure weighing on my temples. Through the window I can see the blue Earth, alone amidst the darkness, silent forever, and then I hear a pop and realize that the glass is shattered. I feel a sharp stabbing pain in both eyes and realize I've been blinded. 

I can't breathe. 

Oh God, oh God, I can't breathe. 

There's nothing I can do. 

It's all black now."

This, too, died away, leaving him stranded among endless back water and the silver glow of the moon.

Silence stretched, his sobbing punctuating the hours.

He cried out, catching movement, ecstatic to find a survivor.

He swam towards it, found no trace.

It emerged again, joined by another, both watching.

Another dissolved out of the waves.

The wormhole shot us across the galaxy, billions of miles away from our planet. In a matter of seconds.

""We did what we could captain"" uttered my crew member James. ""We have no choice but to wait for our death"".

*Before being grabbed by the wormhole, the sun had been emitting an unnatural colour. My boys and i were sent into orbit to investigate, but even a child could tell that the sun was nearing its end.*

*What we had predicted came to pass. It was in an instant. The sun exploded. The men and I inside the space station were left helpless as we watched the sun burn our world. In a vain attempt to say farewell to our families, we sent a transmission to any who could hear:*

*""Please! Anyone! Our home is dying!""*

*Before we could hear anyone, a wormhole ripped and consumed our spacecraft, disabling all our engines. The crew and I were torn away from spacetime, and displaced a few light days away from Earth.*

It had been a few hours in this unfamiliar place. Having seen a familiar galaxy nearby we studied back on Earth, we traced our wormhole opening's location. It was with this knowledge that we located our Sun. To many of us' surprise , we saw our sun, no more special than the stars around it, in its former glow and wonderful light.

A huge sigh rolled through the crew mates, many of whom feeling compelled to think we had just experienced a bad dream, but I had to remind them the cruel reality of our situation.

""Gentlemen. This light we see is the light from a few days ago. What we are looking at are the remnants of our once living solar system"" i announced regrettably.

Having succumbed to our circumstance, we sat and started to distract ourselves with tales. I learned of James love for poetry. I found a mutual lover of jazz in Marcus. Peter spoke of this lady with tits so massive we could see them from this place. It helped remove the sombre atmosphere, but all hope was lost. We just cherised what was our former sun through the cold windows of our shuttle. Its colour grew weaker and weaker.

That was, until we started receiving a signal from the direction of our Sun. We jumped for joy. Our optimism replenished. Many of us cried and hugged each other, thinking this bad dream would finally end. Marcus rushed anxiously to the computer and we recieved a broadcast.

*""Please! Anyone! Our home is dying!""*

A haunting voice: a frightened, pleading child: imitated by an ancient alien.

DENNA… DOONAAH… DEKRIPFT…

It was what the Stele said: what it quite literally *said.*

Twenty meters tall, millions of years old, seemingly indestructible, the Stele’s three dense columns of etched markings yielded no patterns that the VoidNich AI could identify as written language. But there was a pattern they did match: a three-part spectrogram of a human child’s speech. Slurred and unnatural, yet genuinely disturbing.

DENNA… DOONAAH… DEKRIPFT…

“Will you stop it?” Sovannara said to Iwobi, who kept replaying the waveforms. “It’s creepy as hell.”

“I wonder if the last part is ‘decrypt’,” Iwobi said.

“Decrypt what, though?” Danešová chimed in. “What’s ‘denna doonaah’? Sounds like babble.”

“Maybe it’s trying to remember your name,” Sovannara said.

“Yikes.”

“I mean, it’s probably just something alien,” he continued. “VoidNich can only check for what it’s familiar with. Of course this is the creepiest coincidence ever, on the creepiest planet ever, but… it’s a crazy big universe, right?”

This was humanity’s eighth discovery of sentient life on an exoplanet. Long dead, like the previous seven: but not quite *as* dead. There was odd seismic microactivity half a kilometer underneath the Stele.

“Crazy, *to fakt jo,*” Danešová said. “Every metric shows that the Stele predates humanity. And it’s talking to us?”

“Well, just because we use tachyons for crude things like faster-than-light travel,” Iwobi said, “doesn’t mean they couldn’t use it for finer things. They might be listening in on us right now… in the past, I mean.”

Sovannara frowned.

“Seriously? They’re snooping on our conversation?” 

“Think bigger. On our *brains.* That would explain the distressed child. They found that we react strongly to such voices. The message must be important.”

Iwobi played it again.

DENNA… DOONAAH… DEKRIPFT…

“Sorry,” she said. “I’m figuring out what VoidNich missed here. That voice… it’s *wrong.*”

“Yeah, no shit,” Sovannara said. “It’s a piece of rock made to talk like a scared kid by prehistoric alien time wizards. Are they afraid we’re gonna steal their tachyon tech? What does it matter to them now? They *are* dead… right?”

“I don’t mean that kind of wrong,” Iwobi said. “Remember, to them, *we’re* the spooky aliens. They must’ve only vaguely understood how human communication works. Then there’s division of labor. Whoever encoded the message probably didn’t build the Stele itself. What if the builders… screwed up? Like the million times people on Earth screwed up signs in foreign languages?”

“Then we’ll likely never ‘decrypt’ it,” Danešová said.

“I have a hunch.” Iwobi swapped two of the three holographic waveforms.

DOONAAH… DENNA… DEKRIPFT…

The child’s voice sounded just a tiny bit less unnatural now.

Iwobi spliced the waveforms together.

DOONAAHDENNADEKRIPFT…

“Are you hearing what I’m hearing?”

“Um… no?”

“*Ježíši Kriste.* Slow it down for him.”

“I’ll just say it.” Iwobi dismissed the VoidNich interface and pulled up the nervous red dots of the seismic monitor. “I think they’re trying to say, ‘Do not enter the crypt’.”"
dwvgy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dwvgy0/the_taste/,The Taste,10,0,1573845546.0,"After the Monkey Puzzle tree stopped receiving tidbits and a neighborhood child went missing, the Ostlers moved upstate. Now, half a century later, Robert squatted in the bathroom of the farmstead he grew up in, waiting for his brother Richard, who only communicated in dollars. 

“*...Still a prime piece of real estate, Robert. Chequered history notwithstanding. Time to cash in.*”

*“Sure, I can just see the Realty blurb: ‘Property in need of restoration. Original features include picket fence, cherry orchard and weird, flesh-eating tree.’”* 

*“Time moves on, brother. Nothing was proven and anyway it behooves us… Our parents’ memory...”*

Richard’s letters came franked by an attorney’s stamp and with words like ‘behoove’ and ‘notwithstanding’ in them. Robert’s replies were hand-scrawled and shoved into repurposed envelopes. Sometimes he would write: ‘Fuck you!’ in the space where the stamp went. It all depended on his mood and perhaps the tenor of the previous missive.

The Monkey Puzzle had to go of course. *Chequered history notwithstanding*. Robert had long ago accepted his brother’s lack of conscience, but if he wanted to end their wrangle, Richard would roll up his sleeves and confront this thing together with him; tonight. The buzz saw hung from its nail in the woodshed, blade oiled between steady slugs of Wild Turkey from Robert’s hip flask. It was long overdue. *It behooves us...*

Robert Ostler shifted his weight on the cracked toilet seat, taking another swig from the flask, wondering where his goddamned brother was and thinking of that spiny trunk spiralling up the eaves, the amount of Dutch courage it might yet take to embrace those groping arms and spaded leaves.   

It had been a joke at first. Through a lattice of vines the Puzzler came calling, always at mealtimes. “He’s hungry,” our father would chuckle as it tap-tapped the window. 

Secretly, as a way of ditching the leftovers from our groaning plates, we fed him with fatty slivers of pork, sinew of beef and knuckle of chicken. They all ended up in the Puzzler’s rooty maw and before long, he would tap-tap late at night too, a swaying, insistent beggar, shucking through the rafters. Once or twice, I spied my brother’s shadow stripe the yard, smuggling mutton and pie crust in gravy jugs from the kitchen.

Years went by. The Monkey Puzzle flourished. When it reached my attic window I told Richard to stop, threatened to tell if he kept on. But even once the scraps dried up it found a way. The Jays and squirrels nestling in its forbidden boughs. A cat here, a possum there, then...  

*Tap-tap.* 

“See,” Richard accused. “It's got the taste.”

*Tap-Tap.*  

Dear God, that poor kid. All they found were his coat and sneakers. 

*Tap-tap.*

And now the face contorted against the bathroom pane is Richard’s. His body writhing aloft in a ragged grip of spikes. 

“Help me!”

Unless there’s more whiskey to drown out his screams, it will be a long night."

Chips with ruffles.

Take PKY057 for example.

Ostensibly a powder to prevent chafing but a careless lab tech let some of it get in to a cut. When his wife complained, over dinner, about the state of the garage he caved her skull in with the still-warm skillet then went right back to eating his T-bone.

The next day, in custody, he couldn’t explain why and hung himself with his shoe laces.

PKY057 quickly got reassigned to a more classified department.

It was the monkey trials that cracked it. When introduced to the blood-stream it radically alters brain chemistry, not increasing rage or anger, quite the opposite actually.

The MRI scans show a significant decrease of activity in the orbital cortex, which regulates impulse control and judgement, and dopamine spikes when depriving others of food or inflicting pain. When PKY057 dissipates in the blood, after about 48 hours, the test subject would revert back to regular brain chemistry. Though their behaviour would become abnormal, acting sullen, isolated, even practising self-harm by banging their heads against the cage bars.

Can monkeys feel regret?

One for the philosophers.

The applications were obvious; a cop that doesn’t hesitate, a soldier with no fear, a leader that never questions himself.

It was decided to proceed to human trials and that’s where I come in, having no regard for my own health and being desperately broke.

Two weeks. $2000. One dose every other day, a line actually, you snort it.

The change was obvious; I was more decisive, confident, all the worry and self-doubt melted away. I got the promotion, got laid, got paid.

Then the trial ended and I was hit with the comedown; regretting everything, all the old weakness washing back in.

Pathetic.

One of the other guys on the trial just wanted the cash and pocketed his doses. I tracked him down and offered my $2k straight up for his stash.

Then I took all of it. Two weeks worth in one fat line.

Next thing I know I’m at the project leads house, with a knife to his daughters throat and demanding his pass-card.

I liberate months worth of PKY057 from the lab then hit the road. A new man.

Easy to be self-sufficient when you’re not burdened by conscience. I’ve done some tremendous things, some…invigorating things.

But I’m running low.

And I can’t go back, to the old me, the weak me, he wont be able to live with the memories of the last few months.

So I’m heading to Mexico, to meet up with a cartel. They can have the recipe for free, all I want is a lifetimes supply.

""Well, we have a saying: sooner or later, the sea will call your name,"" the sailor told the boy. ""Few of us grow old. You'll understand one day."" 

The sailor knew this saying well. More times than he wanted to remember, he'd seen his colleagues fall overboard and descend into the void. Storms can do that.

However, even during slow nights and in calm waters he sometimes found one of his friends diving through the opaque surface. They gave no warning or protest. They just jumped. Even those that had retired every so often returned to the coast, as if invited,  only to be swallowed by the waves. 

Drowning was a slow and painful fate, but also gravely silent. It’s as if nothing exists outside the struggle for life, not even words and not even thoughts. Only the sound of the ocean. They called it a burial at sea since the bodies were too hard to bring back.  But that wasn't the sailor's reason for fearing the sea. A sailor must accept the risks.

What terrified him was seeing them all again. He'd find them in the water when he was alone. Still drowning, still silent — hollowed eyes, wrinkled mouths gasping for air through the seaweed— they scratched the hull with their rotten nails. What's buried isn't supposed to suffer. It’s not meant to struggle. 

""Grandpa, are you sad? It's okay. I miss papa too.""

""I'll be fine,"" the sailor whispered. Of them all, the boy was the hardest. 

And so the sailor shoved the boy into the black water.

""What are you doing?"" the boy whimpered. He couldn't reach the boat's edge. All he could do was claw at the bottom. ""Grandpa, help me!""

""I'm sorry.""

The boy screamed as he fought the current that was pulling him down.

""Grandpa, I can hear it. I CAN HEAR IT! Help me, please! I'm scared!"" 

""Forgive me, but I don't want to be one of them,"" said the sailor, and not after long, the boy sank into the silence.

Only a few sailors grew to be old, for sooner or later, the sea would call the sailor's name.

Finally the bell rings. I stretch my aching body, go grab a cup of coffee - well, I don’t know what they put in it anymore and still call it coffee, and I’d rather not - and head out. The heat is almost unbearable. I scurry to the tramway and weasel my way inside amongst the crowd. 

As always, I scan the faces around me. They all look the same. Tired, dead tired, I could say with irony. No one talks. Some listen to music. Some just stare at the urban scenery stretching for as far as the imagination can conceive.

The worst are those who do not work underground. Their faces are burned from the sun, they lost their hair to multiple chemos so long ago. We pity them. We thank them for their service. They pay debts, mostly. 

The right pictograms flash as the tramway comes to a close. It’s my stop. I get out, someone steps on my toe; hard. Seventh times it breaks.

Inside is a mess. I’ll get to tidying it up later. For now, a bit of rest on the huge bed. It’s a two-person apartment. My wife left me ages ago. Love isn’t forever. 

It’s not supposed to be. 

On my TV screen, Neymar and Mbappé play against each other. Again. I wonder how they can still run, shoot, and seem excited about the result after all these decades. I bet some money on one of the team. It loses. Fuck.

I go to bed and wonder what detail stood out, today. I find none. It’s more and more difficult to find something original in my life these years.

He had one left.

He eyed the undead that were running towards him, he didn’t want to be like them. Another faceless undead in the horde.

He aimed his gun at his forehead and shot, never understanding what caused this nightmare.

He let out a sad sigh. “We don’t know yet why these people suddenly violently start attacking other people, but the working theory is that the people affected by the virus lose the ability to recognize other human beings, an extreme case of prosopagnosia making them see other human beings as monster.”

I had seen the creature crawl into the bag while it lay open on the table between us. It was a blur of movement, so I thought I had imagined it. When you don't sleep for two consecutive nights because you're studying like a madman, you tend to begin seeing things, so of course I assumed it was just a trick of the light. What I'd seen couldn't possibly be real. Nothing that big has that many legs... 

And now I sat and watched as she raised the chip to her lips, as if in slow motion. She was too focused on her notes and her work to see the brown speckles attached to the bottom of the chip, eggs that would rapidly spring into action, racing through her blood, taking hold of her brain, her mind, her body, paralyzing her before seizing control of her motor system, moving her at its own will like a marionette.

I wanted to move, to yell, to slap the chip from her hand. Instead, I sat, paralyzed, though not by fear, oh no. I was paralyzed by the creatures sinking their claws into my own brain, playing my neurons and synapses like a stringed instrument, merging their thoughts and memories with my own."

Before long I notice a light in the distance. I rush towards it, hoping desperately for an exit. 

Instead I find a bathroom vanity. 

A bright bulb in a pretty fixture, white sink, cobalt blue tile, dark wood cabinets. 

Beyond the confusion, is an intense feeling of dread. 


I know this. I've seen this. 


As I approach the vanity, I notice there's a light shining from a hole under the cabinet doors. 

Against my better judgement I feel drawn to that light. Now on my stomach, I creep towards it. The hole seems to be expanding, becoming large enough for me to nearly crawl through. I stop just before I can look down that seemingly never ending pit. The light has vanished.  


Dread. Fear. 


I know this. This fear. This evil. 


There's something down there. Hidden in that deep darkness. 

I don't know what it is, but I do know that it's my fault. 

Whatever is down there, is down there because of me. 

And it hates me. 


I yank myself back, away from the dark, away from the hole. The vanity has vanished. All I see around me is eyes. Thousands of eyes. All staring at me, as they fall up into the dark. Spinning around, trails of viscera twisting along behind them. 


Panicking, I try to run. There's nowhere to go. Everyway I turn, the hole from under the vanity is there. Growing steadily larger. 


I have no choice but to look inside it. 

The light is back. Two pricks of light, glowing very faintly. 


It's you. I'm so sorry. I remember. 


The twin lights glow brighter, revealing themselves to be a pair of eyes. Large, haunting, hungry. I can no longer look away. 


Dark, twisted hands reach out, gently taking mine. A soft voice whispers in my ear. 


I missed you. 


As I relax, those once gentle hands tighten around my wrists, yanking me into the darkness like a doll. On a hiss I hear one last thing. 


You'll never forget me again. "

Her voice came from nowhere, spinning Brian in his chair. He looked about the empty computer lab, rows of desktops shimmering blue-black in the electric darkness. 

""Hello?"" he said.

Silence.

He cracked his neck, scratched through his beard, and spun back to the message boards. A comment waited, half-finished, an evisceration of some moron's contention that perhaps there was a god and we just didn't understand what it was, especially given the grandness of the cosmos.

Brian sneered, took a swig from his energy drink, popped a mouthful of chocolate balls, and continued to type away.

They were all dullards in his estimation. He knew so much, and they so little. He had even argued in favor of the existence of god, and fairy folk, and little green men, just to be contrarian. He had argued for one political party, and then another. He had even taken sides in battles over soda, using one product's ingredients to both celebrate and then demean its quality. 

If the boards went left, he went right. And always the last word. Always his supreme knowledge left him the victor.

""We're all really impressed.""

Her voice came again, and Brian stood, the chair rattling away from him. Still no sign of her, but the sarcasm had dripped from every word, seeping into a part of him that always begged to stop his long days of planting himself in front of a computer and just get out, get away, get anywhere and make something more of himself.

Pride swelled, and he snarled.

""Who's there? Come out, you...you simpleton!""

The chair groaned behind him, and before he could turn around her hands gripped his wrists, pressing ten fingers attached to ten talons that shot searing waves of filth up his bones.

He gasped, unable to turn around. Her words spilled like a demented purr, full of mockery and malice.

""I've watched you day in, and day out, and I just can't take it anymore. It's not worth being the devil on your shoulder. You're going to die alone, and miserable, because you think you're so smart. But you're a bore. A tedious, horrible bore. Your angel abandoned you long ago, and we don't even want you in Hell. Face it, Brian. You're just not that interesting. So get used to this place. Because it's all you'll ever have left.""

A sound like screams grating against charred stone, and she was gone. 

Brian turned around and found ash and filth layering the chair, and the cursor blinking on his screen, and he stood alone. Alone in the electric darkness that even devils would not tread."

Her skin looked waxy in all that mortician’s makeup and, looking at her, Laura could hardly believe she was attending her old friend’s funeral, and not yet out of her thirties.

Janey’s spidery hair was still the same blonde colour Laura remembered from their childhood and the strange transparent cast to her skin, through which weak blue veins were visible, made her look even more like the little kid she’d known.

Standing there by the open casket, an unexpected memory came back to Laura: the silly game they used to play during tuck breaks at school:

“Buy my cold hands,” the young Janey would say.

Laura would buy them and pretend that her hands were cold.

“Buy my dizzy head,” Laura said.

And Janey would buy— staggering around on her little legs, pretending dizziness.

One day Janey had looked at Laura strangely.

“Buy my monsters,” she said, and suddenly the game was serious and Laura didn’t want to play anymore.

The idea of Janey’s monsters had scared her. She didn’t buy and—truthfully— Laura had spoken less and less to Janey after that day: avoiding her in the playground, becoming estranged from her more and more as their schooling went on and eventually losing touch entirely in adulthood.

Laura touched her old friend’s cold face.

Cassandra couldn't taste the food she ate since birth.

Despite her condition, Cassandra learned to cook since young. Somehow, seeing others eat happily made her happy too. That's her family's expression when they eat her grandma's cooking. So she asked her to teach her, and her grandma gladly taught her. 

Cassandra was a natural. She knew just by looking if a dish is lacking some spices or cooked for a minute too long. She became the head chef at a five-star restaurant, a restaurant so famed that even celebrities and politicians came in daily basis.

Being a top chef made her circle of friends filled with famous people from all over the country. There's this man, a popular actor named Tom who seemed to like her. Handsome, rich, yet humble and nice. She's comfortable when he's around. So when he finally asked her out, she said yes.

One week later, Tom asked Cassandra to accompany him for an award ceremony. After the gala, they were picked up by his limo. Their chauffeur opened the car door and they went in. But that's the last thing Cassandra could remember, as she blacked out after that. Before she knew it she was tied on a chair, in a room without window. There's a table in front of her. Tom's not with her.

""Oh, you wake up. Perfect timing,"" said a man, whom Cassandra recognized as Tom's chauffeur. ""I cooked breakfast.""

He put a plate of steak on the table. ""Please have a taste. I want to know your opinion of my sirloin.""

""That's not sirloin. More like a flank,"" said Cassandra. ""Wait, that's not even beef...""

A sudden realization washed over Cassandra's mind and she struggled violently under her rope. ""What did you do to Tom?!""

""Nothing. Yet,"" he answered. ""Hey, do you think this is his *meat*? I am offended.""

""Let me see him, then we'll talk about whatever meat this is,"" Cassandra negotiated, to which the man finally agreed. He went out of the room, and when he came back he brought Tom, gagged. The man tied him on a pole.

""See? Now eat it,"" he said as he untied Cassandra. Tom shook his head in disapproval. 

She took a bite. As she expected, she could taste it! Sweet and juicy, but not tender. Cassandra knew what meat it is... 

""Tasty, isn't it?""

Cassandra started to feel excruciating pain in her stomach. 

""Do you think I don't know your restaurant regularly kidnaps people and serves them as your fancy cuisine? And that human meat is the only *food* you can taste?""

Cassandra just noticed now that a bunch of blood-soaked gauzes were stuffed in her midsection. She fell off her chair.

""The anesthesia wears off, huh? Nah, can't let you die yet.""

He unpacked an ampoule of morphine. 

""Be grateful, Tom. I just saved you from this bitch,"" said the man as he approached her, whistling."

Every 5 days there's a murder, a massacre or a fire so devastating that there's nothing left when it's out.

He shuddered as he read what little details were given about the most recent massacre. A family had been out at a festival all day, and were killed when they returned home. All of them, brutally. Parents, children, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. All gone after a big family outing.

He looked out his window at the ocean. He lived in a small 2 bed bungalow, and since the killings started 3 years ago he'd spent a fortune fortifying it against all manner of intruders. What if the killer came for him? There didn't seem to be any reason for the killings, but they were happening in more remote areas now. 

He lived 4 miles away from his nearest neighbour, and even though he hadn't left his home in years he was paranoid that he would be next. He struggled with panic attacks on a regular basis, and he was worse today. It had been 5 days since the last attack.

He set his day off with his medication to help with his panic attacks, they made him a little fuzzy but nothing else worked. He tried therapy once, he didnt like the therapist so he never went back. He was happy staying at home. He was safe at home. 

As the night drew in he fell asleep in his chair. The TV was muted, and a book was left open on his chest. It had been an odd day, he kept misplacing items and finding the radio or lights on in empty rooms. *Must be the stress.* He told himself again and again over the day.

He dreamt of a sharp pain across his chest. It grew more intense and he couldn't breath. He awoke sputtering, liquid filled his mouth. He tried to speak but nothing came out. When he looked down he could see the book on the floor in the glow of the TV, it looked wet. It *was* wet. It was wet because he was bleeding. All the sharp knives were embedded in his torso, handles of spoons and forks disappeared too far into his chest. He tried to call for help, all that happened was more blood choking him 

As the world grew dim he saw it, a monster in the shadows. It looked like it was made out of them.

Another attack. Another news story..."

It sounds extremely out there but you get used to it.

Today there was another random drug check by the police. They brought their drug finding dogs as well and the whole school was to be extensively checked. 


I closed my locker quickly just as I saw a policeman turn around the corner into the hallway. He saw me and gave me a suspicious look. His dog started walking towards me.


My heart started hammering in my chest. Beads of sweat formed at my temples and my palms got sweaty. My hands shook and I took shallow breaths. The police dog came closer and closer. He started sniffing at each of the lockers in turn. He approached and closer to mine, ready to find some drugs.

One jumping happily in the air then proceeding to grab their partners face and saying yes between kisses, seemingly  unfazed by the gunshots. Perplexed, I stopped running to turn around. I didn’t see any men with guns chasing after me. Just as that thought crossed my mind an unseeable bullet hit me in my right thigh, bringing me to my knees. Quickly following that one came another, hitting me fatally in the stomach. The pain tore through my body, my vision clouded over. When I came to I saw the sky. Fading from a starry black to blue to orange to some far off yellow. I was laying on the ground, my own blood surrounding me.

without food.

Three, without water.

The pool of blood drying to my 

face, so thick and stiffening, my 

left eye held shut by hardened liquid.

Unable to move, my arms and legs 

stretched out,

lying on my stomach.

Chained to metal spikes

that had been hammered into 

the concrete floor 

of the basement. 

The face staring across from me 

was that of an elderly anorexic man,

completely naked, 

bald head cracked and 

leaking brain and blood.

He was my captor.

He hid in the backseat of my car, 

until I got off work. 

I saw him just as the syringe 

plunged into my neck. 

Now, however, my kidnapper was 

only a corpse. 

In a stroke of luck, or divine-intervention,

my life had been spared.

He was slowly coming down the stairs,

brandishing a box cutter, 

staring through big red eyes,

tears streaming down his face.

“How do you want to die? 

Should I open up your throat?”

I wanted nothing more than to live.

To see my mom and dad, 

my annoying little brother. 

Pulling desperately at my restraints,

as I watched in horror as he descended 

towards me.

But before he could get down the stairs, 

the board he was standing on snapped, 

and the man came crashing to the ground. 

His head hit the unforgiving floor 

with a sickening thud, followed immediately 

by wet splatters, as his head burst 

like a pimple. 

I had survived, and just as soon as 

help arrives, I’ll be in my cozy home

with my family.

I can’t wait to see...

The silence was broken by a 

quiet scratching sound.


My blood froze.

A small rat appeared, and scurried 

up onto the chest of the man’s corpse.

It sniffed, moved toward his neck,

and without hesitation, began biting 

the flesh from his throat...

The gag around my mouth wouldn’t

permit me to scream.

I shut my other eye tightly,

and tried to think of anything other than

what I had just seen.

Until I heard the scratching noise 

growing louder.

I felt something against my leg,

tearing at my jeans as I desperately 

tried to shake it away.

I felt one on my back.

I opened my eye, and to my terror,

the man was covered in rats, 

furiously devouring him. 

They piled on me, gnawing away at 

my clothes, frenzied and determined.

My eyes fell upon the box cutter 

lying next to the man. 

I stared longingly at it, 

lusting at the thought 

of burying the blade in my neck.

Anything but this, I thought, 

as they began devouring my face...

“How do you want to die?”

Since the last two months, they have been witnessing a horror show. Every Thursday at 7:30 in the evening, someone has been forcing people to commit suicide at the crossroad. Till now, there were eight murders. The victims’ eyes were found wide open and they had made a quick cut across the neck and on the wrists, forcing the blood to scatter in every direction. The identity of the killer was a mystery. The police failed miserably, making the killer unstoppable.

Kayra was more restless this evening. The last victim was her friend and it was another Thursday. The clock read 7:00. She couldn’t take her eyes off of the crossroad. 

At 7:15, a man walked down toward the crossroad. He stood in the middle of the road. After a minute or so, he brought out a long knife from the back pocket of his jeans. He slit his both wrists and then gave a quick cut across his neck. The blood came rushing out of his veins and he fell on his knees. The police found a note, stating, “Did you see how fascinating it is to watch the blood flow?” The dead man was Kayra’s father.

For the next two months, there were no more suicides. People believed that the killer simply changed mind and the vicious cycle has ended. Kayra was recovering from the shock of losing a parent and was kept busy as people visited her home to offer condolences.

It was Thursday. Dr. Ajit Paralikar’s bungalow stood at the end of the road. He was a single parent of a six-year-old daughter, Lily. The clock made a sound when it struck seven and a shadow entered the bungalow. Dr. Paralikar sensed someone’s presence and he turned around.

“Oh, it’s you. You scared me. Are you here for Lily? She is upstairs, playing with her dolls.”

“No, she isn’t there.”

“You already checked? Then let’s look for her, shall we?”

“No need. She is exactly where she is supposed to be. And you will be where I need you to be in another 10 minutes.”

The figure offered Dr. Paralikar a long knife and he instantly knew what his fate was.

“It’s quite simple. You or her. You have seen what others did. You are a doctor. I don’t have to tell you how to make the blood flow out of the veins. Go on or Lily dies.”

He pleaded, “Please, don’t harm her. I’ll do exactly as you want. Let her live.” A tear dropped from his eye. He took a deep breath and walked out of the house and headed toward the crossroad.

Kayra felt the rush that she was missing for two months. She couldn’t take her eyes off the crossroad. Another 10 minutes and she would get to watch the most satisfying thing in the world. There is something addictive to look at the blood flowing out of the veins, she thought."

Jake knew better than to tell anyone. It would probably mean more psychologists with their fake caring smiles, more pills, more feelings of being weird. He might even end up in one of those institutions.

He did start a secret dream journal, though. But there weren’t any more dreams like that. Or maybe they meant something small and he missed it.

Then one night, he dreamt of a UFO crashing through Antarctic ice into a colony of penguins. The ice was clear and the penguins were underneath it for some reason. One got killed.

The following day, the Atlanta Thrashers played the Tampa Bay Lightning. *Not* the Pittsburgh Penguins, who’d already beaten the Thrashers 5-3 two weeks ago and weren’t playing on that day. Still, Jake was quite sure he knew what was going to happen. The puck would fly off and injure or kill someone in the stands. Or maybe not, if Jake stared at the TV hard enough. He was, after all, psychic.

The Thrashers lost 3-4, but no spectators were hurt. Jake wasn’t sure if he ought to congratulate himself.

Then the news came. There’d been a shooting incident in town. A stray bullet went through the window of the Penguin Ice Cream Bar and killed a patron. The shooter’s middle name was Roswell. Like the Roswell UFO.

Jake felt helpless and angry. He should’ve considered less obvious interpretations. Then again, who decided to give this mission — if it’s a mission — to a boy of ten, with enough on his plate as it is?

He continued recording his dreams, even though they felt like regular junk dreams. Then, almost six months later, came a dream that he immediately knew meant something.

He was standing somewhere, holding an ice-cream cone and wearing shorts. An insect came buzzing loudly and stung his leg. Then another one stung him in the other leg. Bright allergic rashes broke out. He knew he had to keep standing there, but the itching in his legs was becoming unbearable. He shifted a little. At once, he began to sink into the ground until he could no longer see his legs.

Jake woke up with a start and thought, *here we go again.* He had no idea what to make of this one. It was just weird. Did the ice cream have to do with the shooting in March? Why did he hold it above his head? What were those unusual silvery insects?

As Jake wrote the date for the journal entry — September 10, 2001 — he told himself to stop panicking. He still had a whole day to figure it out."

They took careful steps before zooming into the living room, rummaging through my TV entertainment center. I snuck up behind them and just stood there. They moved their elbow, which bumped into my leg. The burglar turned around, looking at me in shock. I swung the kitchen knife downward and stabbed them right in the neck. I let them choke on their own blood for a few seconds before pushing them to the floor and continuing to stab them.

I stopped my reign and stared at their lifeless, cut up and bloodied body. Normally someone in this situation would immediately call the police. But I don't like the police. I dragged the body to my basement. I picked them up and threw them on the pile. I stood back and admired my work. All these lives... so easy to kill. And one literally came to my doorstep.

Don't step into the lion's den."

Well it goes back to when things were great along the streets of Burgenden, the houses where unguarded and the money was easy. The people knew me well, but never my face, only by the emptiness of their homes upon return. So this streak of luck found me outside the Dreven Manor. The house was like all others along the street clean, white, and filled with a pretentious air. I kept to my normal routine and flipped around back to the windows along the yard. I eyed the back of the home precisely till I spotted what I came for. A small window leading to the kitchen cracked open slightly to let in the cool October air. I quietly stalked to the window and with a well worn tool from my bag, pried the window open. As silently as a midnight cat I slipped through the opening and into the house. I never knew the man who once owned the property, but I had attended his funeral the day prior as a member of the community. His possessions would be whisked away quickly with little notice, for his will was left blank. I began to leave the job to my keen eye for wealth among material, but as I moved through the house I was stopped by shock. A shadow reflected from a dying fire lit by an unknown keeper. The shadow was that of a man in his early 40s. He sat in an armchair reading a book of sorts even though the room had a darkness that would prevent such a hobby. I recovered from the shock of this unplanned occupant and began to back away from room. As soon as my backtrack began the man shoot from his seat and turned with an impossible speed to face me. In the dim light I caught a face familiar to that of the one I had seen in a casket the day before. A great fear gripped my heart as I ran from the room only to be chased by the impossibly living man. Trapped by my own path taking I shoot into the garage and grabbed a long poll. I only held it for one breath before I turned around with a mighty swing. I expected a noise like that of meat or bone but instead a loud shattering was heard. I pulled from my bag a light to see what I hit and where my chaser now was. Upon the floor I found a horrific sight. What I once assumed to be man was made of porcelain. "

Norman kings would have marveled at its design. Byzantines would have raised entire armies to take it. Some guy in a tweed jacket would have wanted to study and devote his entire career to it.

It was a glorious castle, at least for one created from cardboard blocks.

Okay, maybe it wouldn’t make a list of best castles ever, but it was the best one John had built. It had four towers tall enough to walk into, a courtyard surrounded by a short wall, and a throne room with a tiny throne. The ravine in front resembled a moat, if viewed with some imagination.

John was admiring his own craftsmanship when he noticed a little one watching him. He ran to the castle wall and picked up a long stick that he had been saving for this moment. Flinging the stick over his shoulder, he acted like a soldier, walking along the moat-side wall, giving a cartoonish salute and pivot whenever he reached a tower.

The little one smiled. John wanted a better reaction, so he broke off from his post and ran to the throne room. He promoted himself to king of the castle. Imaginary scribes, nobles, and dignitaries surrounded him, and he pointed his stick at them and issued decrees. Chest puffed, he alternated raising eyebrows to maximize the regal effect.

The little one giggled.

One final trick. John ran to the tower closest to the little one and went underneath it. He squinted from a hole in the bricks, and waited for the invaders to pass. Bricks exploded to the ground as he jumped up, yelled, and waved the stick above his head like a madman.

The little one laughed hard, tugged on its mother’s arm and pointed at John. The mother smiled and nodded. She led the little one away, likely to the next exhibit. They were on the other side of the glass, so John wasn’t certain. He was glad his captors gave him a plethora of blocks so that he could create such awesome entertainment.

One of the other humans sobbed in the back of the enclosure.

“I think that little one will remember the funny human for a long time, unlike the miserable humans in back,” John said to himself, but loud enough for the others to hear.

“Damnit, I think they broke John,” one of them said to another.

John smiled.

“Broken, that’s a funny way to describe contentment,” he thought."

The sun was setting as she reached the front door, and once inside she set about getting the fire started before making dinner. A calm uneventful evening before bed. *Finally*, she sighed, *all is well*.

Lights out and ready for bed, Viola headed for the kitchen for a glass of water. That's when she saw them, black masses shaped like people. Moving quickly through the living room, to the stairs and to the kitchen before beginning the loop again.

Sweat drenched her as terror gripped her heart. It wouldn't stop, no matter where she runs. Every time she settles, it's always the same. Ghosts, spectres, demons; she didnt know what to call them anymore, only that they found her. No matter how far she went, they would always come.

Like all the times before she would fight back, using what ever she could to survive until the morning. When they touched her she felt nothing but cold dread, and saw only darkness. Lashing out with everything she had she held on, and when the morning came she would move on again. *Always searching* for peace and quiet.

All that was left in the house was quiet by mid afternoon the next day.

Tap, tap, swish... Tap, tap, swish... closer and closer, the grinding drag of the metal ax on the icy asphalt immobilizes him, but the pain is too much.
Tap, tap, swish...
He feels it, it is behind him. A red stream, gushing from its wound, flows in the middle of the road.
The screeching goes off, time stops.  He listen to his heart beat wildly, he lower his head and cries. He feels only the cold steel pierce his skull and darkness.

December  23rd

Dear Diary,

The other night, Shelly had her house free. The plan was to go to her to get drunk and do some healthy post-school chaos. At midnight Kate, that vapid goose, comes out with this idiot game she had learned by watching a video on YouTube; we had to turn off all the lights and say a silly phrase in chorus. We did it until the words began to lose meaning, so much so that now I do not even remember them anymore.
Fuck, the cold I felt when we stopped it, I can not even describe it; I think they also felt it because no one said a word for at least ten minutes.
At that point, Kate has gone crazy, she just pop up and jump  badly, in the sense, with her eyes back, the spasms and all the rest, fuck, horror movie stuff, I say.
We called 911 (those slackers took hours to arrive) and an ambulance took her to the hospital.
I came home and I could not sleep all night, 
 I tried, mind you, in all the ways that came to mind, but that woman in the mirror no longer stopped staring at me, fuck. She was all quiet looking at me and smiling, it seemed that she wanted to jump on me at any moment, she wanted to drive me crazy but the hell that I let her do it. I walked around the house a lot of times. Fuck, I felt like De Niro in ""Taxi Driver"", but not for all his mania of protections towards that prostitute, just for the fact that I can not sleep. 
This morning I woke up in my bed, I must have fallen asleep on a chair and someone must have brought me upstairs.
After I felt bad, I threw up continuously for an hour, it was real disgusting. I went to the toolshed, I took the hatchet that dad uses to cut wood, I had breakfast, I killed my parents and I had a nice relaxing shower. Then I went to the village, on foot cause nobody wanted to bring me. Fuck, the people I met didn’t stop screaming, and because only they know it, I silenced them all one by one. I went to see Kate at the hospital (by the way she was very ill, so I thought I'd do her a favor by interrupting her agonies).
Towards evening the streets were deserted; how sad, especially during the holidays ...
The last person I met was Gregor McKenzie, the guy who was in love with Isabel a few months ago; I'm sorry it ended badly between them. I think I broke the fibula but fuck if he ran, he was a really fucking runner.
At a certain I think he even started crying.
Dear diary, the other night I think I evoked a demon with my friends, all nonsense things of course, crazy stuff, but the fact was still particularly disturbing."

It only posts the phrase “Anata wa anata jishin ni tsuite yoi kibundesu ka?”, which, roughly translated, means “Do you feel good about yourself?” 

Its profile pic is also restrained, depicting a young girl with jet black hair and pale skin. Angel-Chan is always wearing a white dress covered in strange, black stains. Her blue eyes are staring at the person holding the camera. Or according to some, directly at the viewer. 

It’s been said that if one messages Angel-Chan, replying in the affirmative, then they’ll commit suicide not long after."

Of course, I don’t mind. I love the sound of the wind. I get how people think it’s a bit creepy that it sounds like the groans of a dying man, how it gets louder and softer frequently. I think that sometimes too. But that’s just what it sounds like, right? I mean, it probably would be weird if it sounded like anything else, huh?

I really like the sound of the wind at night because it makes me feel warm. I know it sounds a bit selfish and it’s a bit indicative of my more... fortunate lifestyle, but I just take so much comfort in my warm bed and my safe, secure house. It does make me feel bad knowing there’s so many people out there in the cold though.

I fidgeted with the radio dial as we talked excitedly. That’s when I heard it, “...asteroid...collision course, chances at 100%...cataclysmic event...” my stomach dropped and I felt the heat of panic growing from my neck to encircle my head. We drove home in silence. 

The emotion of bringing a new life into the world that he would fail to experience fully was one of undeniable hopelessness. It wasn’t until we got home that we learned the asteroid, named Hermès, would not arrive for another 85 years.

Forced to confront our own mortality, but with most of the population figuring to be gone long before the impact anyway, something miraculous happened. Things got better. 

First, we became practical and ethical, sterilizing ourselves to curb the future doomed.

People on a sinking ship became kind towards one another. We continued our jobs with a sense of pride knowing we were the last generation; teachers, doctors, garbagemen, pilots, plumbers, bus drivers, engineers, and scientists.

The wealthiest money hoarders among us released their riches from banks into global economies and poverty and homeless rates crashed overnight.

Great advances were made in science and health. Major diseases were cured and eradicated. We were healthier.

Businesses that destroyed the environment by raiding it for resources shut down and reversed their course. The planet began to heal itself and wildlife flourished.

Warring nations laid down their weapons to embrace each other. We were a civilization without borders, extremism, or violence. Peace had been achieved.

Passions were pursued. Artists, writers, conductors, and philosophers emerged from the unlikeliest of places and created amazing works to be enjoyed by all.

We were no longer limited by our own fears, hesitations, or discrimination. We maximized our potential.

As I sit alone and blow out the tiny flames that dance above the three numbered candles on my cake, I think back on my family and prepare for midnight. Collision time. Wanting a front row seat to our collective demise, I made the journey to ground zero. It was a peaceful trip because there aren’t many of us left.

The skyscraper shakes and light beams from all the windows. Then nothing. Darkness and quiet. I wait for the explosion. 

It never comes. 

I open the balcony door and with my binoculars I look out onto the massive, smoking object sitting in the middle of a city overrun with vegetation. The only thing I can make out from here appears to be writing on the asteroid. 

It reads N-A-S-A."

I was younger than Art but it wasn’t noticeable. Art still had smooth pale skin and a hot figure.

He always told me he was attracted to my exotic allure. But even as a Latina with personality, I was self-conscious. I mean here was this most unusual, attractive man wanting me over all the THOTs Panama City Beach, Florida had to offer. The type of girls who all had sexier bodies than my untoned physique. My 5’3 frame.

But soon, I got over that shit. Especially after Art convinced me our love would be eternal.

Art’s family lived overseas and they *demanded* we be there this Christmas. The only problem was Art hated flying! He preferred traveling by ship.

So we had to leave a week before Christmas. Due to the schedule, Art insisted we open presents *tonight*. Our last night before we set sail.

I waited for nine o’clock. Art had been dodging me all day. Just staying holed up in our bedroom.

In the living room, our Christmas tree stood tall. Art’s many candles scattered about. But boy was there a lot of presents…

And then I saw it: a huge box in the corner. Red wrapping paper swallowed it.

An alarm distracted me. *9:00*

I marched up to the box. Stared down at its gift sticker. *To: Sarah* *Love: Art* read the cursive.

I ripped through the paper in milliseconds.

A smooth wooden surface appeared. All of it surrounded by a perfect shade of brown bronze.

Excited, I yanked off the last strands.

Then I saw the casket in full. A morbid beauty.

Darlene Love’s “Christmas” started behind me.

I turned to see Art. His smile of fangs so sexy… His red eyes grew brighter.

I felt more elation… Felt my eyes change color. Felt the fangs grow longer. All the intense hunger stirred up inside me.

“You like it?” Art asked.

I nodded. “It’s perfect, babe.”

Art walked up to the casket. “I got it custom made for the trip.” He opened the lid. “It’ll fit both of us, Sarah.”

And he was right. The inside was spacious and filled with silk padding.

Seductive, Art leaned in closer to me. “It’s a long way to Romania, Sarah.”

I wrapped my arms around his neck. “I can’t wait to pass the time.”

Like teenage lovers, we went in for a sloppy kiss. Our hands ran all over each other. This was the most joy I’d felt since the night Art made me immortal. Even more exhilarating than the first time we drank blood. Or the first time we consumed human flesh.

I put a finger to Art’s lips. “Let’s try it now.” 

Showing off my strength, I pulled Art closer toward the coffin. Hand in hand, we descended inside it. Our beautiful nude bodies illuminated by the candles’ warm glow. Then my greatest Christmas gift lasted well into the night..."

Disclosure: If you read this, you will become aware of *her* and be made completely vulnerable. If you wish to sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of nights to come, I recommend that you do not continue.


*****


*She* is not a woman. Honestly, I don't know what she is, but describing her as female is the best that I can do.


She is the rising fear that lingers in the dark...


She is the whisper that shivers through the wind...


She's that ghostly feeling that's always behind you...


She is the scream in your nightmares and the creature in your cupboard...And she is the terrifying and crushing weight of silence, when you're terrified and alone...


...And She is getting stronger.


Now that you're aware of her, she will try and manifest into something that I still can't comprehend myself, or even put into words...but I can, however, tell you how to keep her out...or, at least try...


Please remember the disclosure, there's no turning back now...she knows that you know about her, you must continue, and if you don't, well, I just have one final thing to say...May God be with you tonight.


Okay, first of all, as much of a cliche as it is, check under the bed. If you find black hairs or black fibres, remove them immediately and burn them. No other method will work.


Secondly, check the back of your bedroom door for black smudges, or what *may* look like fingerprints. If you find *anything*, wipe clean using hot water and a white cotton cloth.


And finally, if there is a mirror in your room, be sure to take it down and sleep with the door closed...trust me...


(Side note: if you have findings from both under the bed *and* on the door, **do not** sleep in that room tonight, even after removal.)


Oh, and if at any point you hear scratching, then I'm really sorry...and it'll be best to just close your eyes..."

I got up to get a glass of water. I pulled a glass out a glass from the cabinet, dropped 2 ice cubes in, and filled it at the tap. Once I turned off the tap, I heard a static ringing from somewhere. I looked across the counters, inspected my appliances, and looked in my cabinets and still couldn’t put my finger on where it was. I was irritated as I closed the cabinet door. A loud burst of static came from inside and startled me, making me fall back onto the kitchen table. I opened it again. I pulled out one of my pans to start digging through, and it became louder as I pulled it out, yet it still rang in the background. I put it on the counter in fascination. A man’s tense voice came through the static:

“M-my name is Conan Ingraham. I’m an astronaut at Nasa. I was testing recent developments... in light-speed travel. I-I-I went out too far in doing so.” He paused for a moment. “I’m sorry if my voice wakes you if it comes out of your mattress coils, this transmitter is really powerful... God is lagging behind for now. I’m sorry. He’ll reach us soon.”

The static ended. I stood there, my heartbeat racing. I wanted to hide in the closet, but I knew it was a childish impulse. I scurried to my telephone to call my mother. There were three rapid knocks on my door. I swung the door open to see my neighbor on my doorstep. “Mary, did you hear that, that voice?” she asked, her hands jammed into her armpits. I nodded. “It was in my pots and pans and my kitchen knives.” 

The whole neighborhood was coming outside. Everyone congregated in the streets, realizing their neighbors also heard the broadcast. Most exchanging their fears, some asked what was going on, a few argued it was an elaborate prank. A police car rolled up, and an officer with a megaphone stepped out. “Everyone remain calm. I know it’s very frightening, but we can’t risk our security out of our fear. Please return to your homes,” he spoke into it.

“Look, in the sky!” someone yelled. Two burning white orbs had appeared in the sky, and they were growing larger and larger. They were soon bigger than the Moon. The group scattered. The police officer scrambled back into his car and sped off. I ran back into my house, pulling the door closed behind me. I ducked under my kitchen table, submitting to those childish impulses. 

“You’ve embarrassed me, mortals,” a deep voice shook the Earth, rattling everything in the kitchen. “The others have seen you. Your existence has challenged my omnipotence, and now you will suffer for it.”"

Tyler read the stones as he passed, each date seeping out of time to speak of grief and melancholy, the honoring of the dead by those now ghosts themselves. 

He stopped before a monument nearly collapsed into rubble:

BABY

No date. No name. Evidence of loss so profound that it could not be labeled. Or else a passing of a newborn that was one of many, buried, but forgotten even in its time. 

Tyler knelt, brushing what remained of the tombstone, watching the word begin to fade into evening shadows. He took a vial of blood from his pocket, its livid and rich redness shimmering with strange light, and poured it into the etching.

Wind unspooled, casting the dead leaves into whirlpool, peeking out of the gloom like reaching hands.

Tyler stood, sticking the vial back into his pocket and savoring the cold exhaling from the churning air. He watched the blood drenched name disappear, and with it came darkness, whole and complete, silencing the skitter of leaves, the choral wind, the remains of daylight and the world it bloomed.

Tyler tasted emptiness, joining it to the loss that had permeated his whole being since had lost her, the daughter whom had disappeared and remained never found. With the passing years went his hope, and with that hope everything that he had been until he was a living wraith passing through life.

Better this.

Better here.

They emerged, pale visages called through the netherworld to stand with him, their new brother. He watched them and knew he was of them, these dead dreamers content to be free of the living. They called his name, and with their voices came release.

One stood before him, cradling a tattered blanket in her arms. She offered, and he took it, and within was swaddled that nameless baby, gazing up at him with innocence deepened through this timeless space, an orphan girl gazing up at a grieving father, each inhaling the other, and knowing here, beyond the stars and the shining realm of all things, they had found a home."

 I was shaking too much when I was walking to the car and dropped my keys. By the time I had picked them back up I could feel their closeness, too many to count.

The bread is crispy, a slight char around the edges. It’s good toast, sweet toast. The plate sits there on the plaid tablecloth, the jar of marmalade enticing. New marmalade, from a new vendor. Man by the name of Mister Marnie. She wonders whether it could be the perfect marmalade for her perfect piece of toast.

She had bought it the day before, from his stall at the Farmer’s Market. She’s ready to smear it out on her perfect piece. She unscrews the lid, grabs a tarnished butter knife, and sticks it into the glop. She pulls the knife out, globs of black and drippy goo clinging to the grooves on the tip. It smells horrible, like rotting meat and an open sewer. She wrinkles her nose, and spreads it on the bread with a slight look of disgust. The slathered concoction moves on its own accord, seeping into the spaces between the crumbs. Bubbles appear in the black-hued oil, popping and releasing more of the foul odor into the air.

The woman, she's disgusted. Mister Marnie did her wrong. She backs away from the growing mass, but rushes back and tries to scrape the fluid off. It sticks to the toast, there’s no more need for butter. It’s like rubber now, yet runny, and it smiles at her. A face in the gunk-covered bread, laughing. She grabs the bottle of marmalade and throws it in the garbage can, but something is rising out of the filth. She practically throws the plate in the sink with a shriek of disgust, but the fingers that are composed of the dirty marmalade peek over the edges of the basin. Followed by a head, which rears back and vomits out a dripping stew of wet bread.

She wants to follow suit, but rushes to another room instead to compose herself. She sits on the chair with the crimson throw pillow, and freezes as she sees an oil composed, slimy, and vaguely humanoid mass drag itself across the wooden floor into view. She gasps and stumbles toward the other corner of the room, where she has a good view of the kitchen and the short associated hallway. There are many streaks of black marmalade across the walls and hardwood floor, and the kitchen is covered in a withering, trembling blancmange, pouring in hordes from the trashcan and the sink. She wonders what it is that Mister Marnie gave her in that jar.

But it certainly was not the perfect marmalade for her perfect piece of toast."

You find it strange that this instinct always taunts you and polutes you with fear, it didn't make sense, you stood still there, next to the wardrobe and just as you were about to walk to your bed, for whatever reason, a new instinct presented itself, you turned around and looked up, then, you saw it, long, bony fingers resting over the edge of your wardrobe. you started to cry, no noise, just a silent stream of tears crawling down your face as as a curved shape pulled itself into view revealing a disgruntled head staring back at you, black, rotten and wrinkled skin, the figure breathing raspy breaths. They were never inside, all of these years it was watching you, leering at you silently. You wake up. A nightmare? Maybe, you had to be sure. You looked atop your wardrobe and sure enough, there was nothing there, you sighed a sigh of relief. Suddenly your wardrobe flung open as two slender, decaying arms errupted out of the doors and dragged you inside! You screamed but were soon silenced, it seems your instincts didn't lie."

Hi. I guess I should congratulate you on your new gig. Knowing the nature of it I’m not so sure if I should feel happy for you or pity you.

I’m the latest person who occupied this office. I’m pretty sure you are not allowed to ask questions about me and I advise you don’t. You don’t want to get on their bad side.

I know my time is running out soon. I just know it. You’ll see what I’m talking about later. I can’t explain how, but I know I will soon be eliminated. So I figured I’d make myself useful and leave the next person to take over a guide. 

Read the following list as many times as it takes for you to memorize it. Then get rid of it by tearing it apart and eating the shredded paper (sorry about that, but unfortunately it’s 100% necessary if you value your life).

&#x200B;

1. Always keep this office door closed. When you leave, lock it, even if you are going to away for two minutes. 
2. Don’t search for signs of humanity in the subjects. Trust me, it’s only going to make things harder.
3. Carry headphones with noise cancelling with you. They will make you job easier.
4. Never eat anything from the canteen except for wrapped candy. Everything else is a safety hazard. Bring your own food.
5. In the office next to you there is a woman with blue eyes and dark hair. Do not interact with her. If she asks questions, retreat back to your office. Lock the door.
6. Disregarding rule number two, if you notice a special birthmark under the left eye of one subject (the subject is about 6.1 feet tall) find a way to get rid of him. Don’t feel guilty, it’s an act of mercy.
7. Don’t let the subjects learn your name. 
8. There is a mask hanged on the wall of this office. Always put it under the special safety gear when interacting with the subjects.
9. When going through files on your computer, it’s best to turn off the computer every half hour.
10. If, when re-opening the computer, the photos in the subject’s files have changed (changes in positions, eyes opening/closing etc), close the computer and contact IT immediately.
11. The subjects are not screaming. They are yawning. Keep this mantra in mind and repeat quietly in your mind if necessary. Never say the mantra out loud.
12. There is a loose floorboard in this office. Under the floorboard you will find a gun. The floorboard is located under the trashcan. When you get the feeling they are seeking to get rid of you, take the gun. Put as many bullets to your head as possible. Do not use any other method of suicide. Try to damage as much brain tissue as possible. In that way you will avoid turning into a subject.

Good luck. I hope you stay alive longer than I did."

I have checked them many times and every time I saw that they didn’t steal anything. Then I decided to stop searching them even though the security systems went off. Then this morning I saw a missing little girl poster, it was that little girl who always use to come into the supermarket with her mother. 

The mother though looked nothing like the mother who use to come into the supermarket. I now understand why the security systems use to go off now when they came through."

My heels were so damn noisy. Why couldn’t I have worn flats? They echoed through the empty playground like gunfire.

Click clack.

The man sat on one of the swings. His hair was long; the dark obscured his face, but I could tell he'd noticed me.

Click clack. Of course he had.

“Oi!” He waved at me.

I kept walking. Why was I wearing such a short skirt? And so much make-up, shit.

“Oi, I’m not trying to hassle you.”

He got up and walked after me.

There were 20 yards of grassland to the road, the comforting glow of streetlights, the whooshing of cars –

A shortcut through the park in the middle of the night. How could I be so stupid? – I’d taken it a hundred times, it’d always been fine – 

Crunch crunch crunch. Footsteps behind me.

“I’m just trying to talk to you, pretty. I’m being friendly.”

I walked faster. Click click click click. I’d throw them away, I’d never wear heels again. I was taking shallow breaths, I was cold, my palms were sweaty, I was close to the road, to safety –

“I’m looking for my brother.” His voice was right behind me. His breath was on my ear.

“What?”

I turned my head. His bearded, smiling face was right next to mine.

“My brother, pretty. Have you seen him? Do you know where he is? Oh, but you know.” He grinned.

There were no teeth in his mouth.

I screamed and ran across the grass towards the exit, where I stumbled and fell on my knees.

I was on the road, under a streetlight. Whoosh. Cars.

I trembled. I looked but he wasn’t there, just the park vanishing into the gloom.

Okay.

Okay, you’ve had a lucky escape.

I grabbed my clutch and crossed the street to my house. I unlocked the door and looked back.

Across the street, in the bush – was that him?

No way. Just my mind playing tricks.

I slipped through the door and locked and bolted it. I was shaking so hard I dropped the keys twice. Then I sat on the floor, panting.

It was fine. I was safe. 

Should I call the cops? No, he was just a crazy homeless guy. Besides, my door was basically indestructible. I got up and walked to the bedroom.

When I opened the door he sat on my bed. He was a different man: short hair and wild eyes in a clean-shaven face. Plenty of yellow teeth.

“Why you not talk to him?” he asked. “Why you not talk to brother in the park?”

Outside, someone banged against the front door.

The man got up. He was huge, much bigger than the other one.

“Brother is sad, pretty,” he said over the banging and howling. “You no talk to him. Come, let him in. Let brother in.”

I stood motionless as he advanced, his hand stretched out towards the keys in my hand."

That’s the feeling I couldn’t shake as I hiked along with Michelle. I was worried I was gonna give myself whiplash, I kept turning my head back so quickly. But it was just us: we’d come out here to celebrate the three-day weekend, and while Michelle was caught up in the spirit of things, I continued to have the sinking feeling that we weren’t alone.

“What’s the matter, babe? Worried someone’s following us?” Michelle teased as I suddenly whipped my head back again, certain that the branch breaking behind me was an intruder rushing to attack.

“No, no...just making sure we don’t get mauled by bears or something,” I said jokingly, trying not to sound as nervous as I felt.

“Bears? Really? I don’t know of many bears that hang out near the Mississippi River...”

“Yeah, no, you’re right, I’m being stupid...”

“Phillip, come on—everything’s fine. Can you just please try and have a good time? For once?”

I sighed and did my best not to look behind me. Things hadn’t been going well lately with Michelle, hence the trek to the river: a nice hike, romantic picnic, and maybe even a little spring fever in the fall to spice things up...the only problem was, I couldn’t enjoy it. For whatever reason I was certain there was someone just out of eyeshot, watching. And waiting.

“So this spot right here, this is where Cody—you remember my cousin Cody?—this is where he fell in that summer all of us came out here for vacation. My dad was so pissed because he had to jump in to save him and lost both his contacts! He was literally blind for the rest of the day, it was hilarious,” Michelle rambled on in front of me.

“Mmmm.”

“There used to be a little gazebo area near here too, unless it’s around the next corner...yeah, no, it is, I remember now. We would always make that spot our home base when we came out here,” Michelle went on, continuing to tell story after story of her trips out here as a kid. I didn’t care. There was a sick feeling in my stomach, weighing me down: the certainty that something was off. Someone was going to come around the corner any second now...

“Phillip! For god’s sake, will you knock it off? No one is out here!”

“I-I know, I‘m sorry...”

“What is up with you? You’ve been acting weird all day!”

“I just...things haven’t been going well with us lately, Michelle. You know it. And now we’re here, out in the middle of nowhere with no one around...”

“What, you think someone’s going to jump out and murder us?” Michelle mocked, hands on her hips.

“No...no, I’m afraid someone’s going to see,” Phillip said before pulling out his gun."
dvbmoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dvbmoo/viruses/,Viruses,15,6,1573573168.0,"What are viruses? Where do they come from? 

The answer to the first question is hard to answer. Viruses are an oddity. They are surely not dead, though it is also hard to call them living too. That second question though is what you can actually answer about these things. 

While it would seem to most that viruses have been around forever, that simply isn't true. They show up naturally, usually first occuring in an animal, and then being transmitted to humans. Take, for example, the Chikungunya virus, which comes from many animals, ranging from primates to birds, and is transmitted by mosquitos. 

This particular virus popped up sometime in the 1700's, and has stuck around ever ever since. The symptoms are not that bad though, just some fever, joint pain, headaches. No worse than the flu. But some viruses are not nearly as nice.

Take for example, Ebola. Specifically the Zaire strain of the 1976 outbreak, which occured because a few men in an African village re-buried what they thought to be human bones. Unfortunately for them, they were bones of primates infected with this strain of the virus.

But just how bad is this virus? Well, it causes headaches, fever, vomiting, extreme pain, mass bleeding, and eventual death for ninety percent of those who are unlucky enough to catch it. Though, you'd have to be lucky not to catch it if you came in contact with it. It spreads at a rate of eight infections per infected person, which makes it quite the danger. 

That particular outbreak was so awful that the village had to be quarantined, and eventually destroyed. 

But, not all viruses are as natural as those. Not all come about because of a strange transmission to some animal. How do I know this though?

That's simple to answer. It's because what we are making is going to be much, much worse."

""Jim, what is that?"" Betty asks, pointing to the black spot.

""Just a shadow,"" Jim responds, not even looking up from his tea.

The spot envelops over half of their room, getting darker as she stares at it. When it first started moving, she could still see the faint outlines of her decorations, but now they have all but disappeared.

""I serious, Jim! What is it?"" She yells, slamming her cuppa onto the ground. Jim sighs, looking up, and as he does, the spot grows closer, speeding up as it strengthens.

""Get up Betty, we've got to move!"" Jim screams as they both try to stand up and move away from it, but they are too old to move as fast as they would have liked. The spot makes it to where they are standing, first covering their feet, and then making its way up their bodies.

But the teachers won’t do anything about it. They just shrug and tilt their noses at us. 

“Just don’t go outside,” they say. “You need to study, not play.”

Not at our school, but still! 

We can only avoid the grass and the swings and slides and waste our time standing around the sandbox. There’s no ants in the sandbox.

""Hello Hattie. You look pleased. Did your son visit?"" Etta asked. 


""No."" Hattie said, ""But my granddaughter came. She's in college now, can you believe it?"" A proud smile etched across her withered face


Etta eased herself down onto the bench, her joints making the act difficult. 

These daily walks were becoming harder and harder. She wished she could have her scooter here. At Heartpine senior care she'd had full access, though she hardly used it then. Her pride had refused to admit she'd needed assistance with something as simple as walking. Seemed silly now.


""That's wonderful."" Etta said, a pang of jealousy in her chest.

Her own family hadn't visited in years, and before that it was very seldom. She didn't know when she'd see them next, if ever. But things like that happened all the time. Etta saw it with countless others, and knew her turn was coming. 


Hattie was lucky. She still got visitors, although not often. But at least they still came, which was more than most could say. 


""She's a smart girl."" Hattie gushed, but Etta wasn't listening. She'd let her attention wander to the large iron fence that bordered the property. She found herself looking more and more lately, wishing she could see beyond it. If she had known the view would be blocked, she'd have chosen better, like her awful satin dress that's seen better days.  


""Etta, why are you gawking at that fence again?"" Hattie said, nudging her. 


""Where else should I look?"" Etta snapped, then sighed, and turned away from the fence. 

""My apologies Hattie. I guess I'm a bit tired today."" She said, smiling weakly. 


She was. Tired of the same dried up grounds, the same dried up residents, and of course those pathetic plastic flowers. At Heartpine they had a garden that the residents could tend to.  But it wasn't just the garden. At Heartpine, even the workers were warm and friendly. 

Here, at Everlive the workers hardly smiled, and never acknowledged the residents. But she supposed that was expected.


""I know!"" Hattie said. ""I heard there was a new resident this morning. Shall we go say hello?"" She cooed as if Etta were a small child to placate. 


Etta got to her feet, following Hattie along the path. She did enjoy meeting new residents, although not too young. That was never easy. 


Many of the tombstones they passed were crumbling, jutting from the ground like broken teeth. Etta's own was cracked and fading, but at least her name was legible. 


""Hello!"" Hattie and Etta called, waving at an elderly man who seemed disoriented, but smiled. Etta smiled too. She was glad they wouldn't have to explain things too much, not like with the younger ones. She strolled toward him, eager to meet the newest resident of Everlive Cemetery. "

Many have speculated that there used to be life on Mars, but something put an end to that. The first humans on Mars figured that out the hard way.

When the crew first made it to Mars they quickly set up little tents and started researching the Martian Soil, testing its capability of growing plants. Under the soil however was a the dangerous thing that destroyed life on Mars.

**A Virus.** 

It possibly went on the gloves of one of the crew members and then probably got taken into the tents. It managed to survive all the air filtering systems and infected one of them. Now you may be thinking- it’s probably just a cold, no biggie. However, the virus was terrible, it affected the brain.

Once in, the virus incubates within its host for up to 24hrs. It mutates within the host. After the dormant period, the virus wakes up. The afflicted will immediately show signs similar to PTSD. This can include anxiety, nausea, headaches that are so severe they can induce tremors, seizures, catatonia or paralysis. During this stage the virus also rapidly multiplies and spreads via air to other people.

Then the virus reaches its final stage after 2 days. The infection begins to target the amygdala (fear centre of the brain) and the sensory cortex (part of the brain that is responsible for sensory processing). The afflicted begin to experience increased adrenaline level and heart rate. They feel general unease. The patient starts to seek physical comfort which only causes more spread of the virus.

As the virus sinks deeper and deeper into the brain, it reaches it’s its final form. The afflicted sink into full catatonia which includes lowered heart rate and core temperature and low response. The immune system in completely suppressed as the virus spreads.

The afflicted senses are then enhanced by the virus which cause sensory overload. The afflicted become insane and develop extreme paranoia. They think negative about the people around them and always feel like they are being watched. As the virus reaches its peak the afflicted repeats the phrase- ‘stop looking at me’ over and over again hysterically. They act violently towards anyone hurting or even killing them. They tend to remove the victims eyes using their bare hands. We were able to conclude these symptoms from camera records and reports directly from the crew

Yeah by now you can conclude the virus makes the afflicted a literal zombie. Within weeks the whole crew were infected and they brutally murdered each other. Only one person escaped via an escape pod and came to Earth.

**They recently reported symptoms of the virus**"

I hate when he leaves for work, I miss him so much and I am scared to be alone at the house, especially at night. The tiny sounds of the floors and walls creaking make me jump when he’s not here and I sleep terribly. 

Tonight is just the same. Every sound startled me and I listen intently to make sure I hear nothing else before attempting to lay back down. After an hour of this, I hear a faint sound from outside. I listen as close as I can when I hear a BOOM BOOM BOOM on the front door. 

I grab my cell phone, call 911, and hide in my closet. 

“911, where is your emergency?”

“Ma’am, are you alone? Are you in a safe place?”

“For now, I think, but please send help!”

“Of course, ma’am. Stay on the line while I call for help.”

It felt like I was on hold for an eternity. During the silence another BOOM BOOM BOOM rang through the house. Finally the operator returns. 

“Ma’am, did you say your address is 4133 Poplar Rd?”

“Yes.”

“Are you Alice Williams?”

Through trial and error the design flaws that had plagued early exploration were completely eradicated. There were no more explosive takeoffs, cabin fires, oxygen malfunctions, spacesuit damages, asteroid collisions, or food shortages.

The spacesuits were especially brilliant, virtually indestructible and only removable in safe environments. Space travel was almost becoming mundane, just another method of transportation to get from point A to point B. However, what scientists and engineers can’t always predict about their machines and technologies are the people that use them.

How do you predict that a member of the crew will suffer an episode of psychosis during a satellite repair mission and lock the door to enter the capsule?

What technology can you make to convince him that he needs to let you in and that the astronauts outside aren’t malicious aliens?

How do you use your revolutionary spacesuit to change his mind when he detaches the ropes that tether you to the spacecraft?

Those will have to be the questions the scientists and engineers work on when they figure out what’s happened up here.

Until then, I’m just disappointed with how good their spacesuits are because the only question on my mind as I drift aimlessly through the vast expanse of space is why there isn’t a button anywhere to kill myself."

But it is hard, isn't it?

They've been dead for a day and you don't remember them. Barely anyone will. Our world's too big for such a small amount of our population to ever be remembered. Who were they? What did they look like?

Albert Einstein is remembered for being a genius. George Washington is remembered for being the first US President. Martin Luther King is remembered for his speeches.

It's what you do that gets you remembered.

It's what you *do* that gets you remembered.

Because if your legacy is going to die off so quickly, what was the point of life in the first place?

Therefore, I decided that I won't be forgotten. I'll be the one everyone will be talking about. I'll be the one everyone will remember, whatever it takes.

Someone posted a photograph on a popular meme site that night, captioned ""Can you see her?"" 

The picture itself was an old grainy photograph of a forest. There's a river in the middle of the photo, and an Asian girl was standing at its left bank, smiling towards the camera. 

At least that's what people who could see her say. They described her as around 9-13 years of age, wearing a long yellow dress and a sun hat. The others said they only saw the river but no girl at all. 

At first people thought it was just a trending meme, but then after it got viral people started to realize this peculiar phenomenon. Scientists tried to investigate it from the perspective of neuroscience and vision science but the explanations were inconclusive. Journalists and fact checkers tried to find out the girl's identity and the location to no avail. The original poster also couldn't be tracked. Conspiracy believers theorized that it's a prototype of new imaging technology the government was trying to test on people. Others said the photograph was cursed. People were starting to fear it. 

But three months have passed since it was posted and nothing happened. People moved on. The photograph was forgotten.

Until another picture was posted. Captioned exactly like the first one, the image this time showed the same girl standing close to the camera, sulking. A cute photo actually, for those who could see her.

But for those who couldn't, this new picture showed a completely different image. This time not only there's no girl but also it's a totally different place, apparently a meadow. They described it as similar with that famous Windows XP wallpaper except there was a cave on the right side of the picture, where a bloodied mess that looked like a flayed horse was laid in front of it. People freaked out. It's unknown whether the whole thing was just an elaborate sick joke or a real terrorism act. Some countries even banned this photograph from circulating in their regions. Yet, once again, nothing happened.

The third time this kind of picture was posted people didn't really care. This one just showed a pitch black image, again with the same caption. It appeared this way for both people who could and couldn't see the girl in the previous photographs. Several people said they were seeing different images, but since each of their descriptions were random their remarks were brushed off. 

Then it happened. Three days later the world suddenly went dark. The sun was gone. Instantly vanished without a trace, as reported by NASA and other space agencies. Nobody had a single clue.

Except a journalist who persisted and interviewed all ten people around the world who claimed they could see the picture. He found out that there's a letter inscribed somewhere in the image for each differing visions, and he pieced them together to form a sentence.

Chloe’s youthful, northern tongue always made John smile. The newly qualified sales girl was a sweetheart to chat with, and as their businesses clashed they often had to talk on the phone anyway.

“Again?” John had to ask, this being the fourth time this month that bloody printer had stopped. “Of course. Might want to hurry, though. I’m off shortly.”

It was dark outside. Both stayed behind after hours to catch up on work. Their offices were on opposite sides of the same long empty lane, both deserted save for John and Chloe toiling away.  

She hung up. John anticipated her arrival. 

Time passed, and she never came. This was unusual, but he figured she’d got the machine to work finally, by some miracle. Chloe was famously hopeless with most “tech stuff”, but perhaps. He turned to the window at his desk, noticing her office was now in complete darkness. Just as he reached for the phone to give her a call, it started ringing.

“John,” the whispering voice was all too familiar. It was Chloe. “-th- -there’s a man.”

She stopped there. What man? A colleague? He was sure she’d said she was the only one in her block. John had no clue. “What man?” 

“I- I don’t know. He’s in the office. I need to keep quiet.” Chloe’s voice was tense. Even John felt himself getting more nervous. “He has s- something in his haaand, I-“. 
It sounded like Chloe was in tears. She tried hard to finish that sentence but couldn’t, her voice crashing as her breaths quickened. “…t-through th- the si-i-ide door…”

“Are you serious now?” John questioned, his own voice grim but betraying the man’s fear. 

The line dropped. Chloe was gone.

He didn’t know what to do, sat at his desk, the dead humming of his computer getting louder as he tried to focus. So many questions he wanted an answer to. Was it a joke? What ‘man’ did she mean? Why did she hang up? Was she safe?

The telephone rang after a long period of nothing, snapping John out of his trance.

“John, are you okay?” Chloe shouted, more coherent this time. The clarity in her voice relaxed him a little.

“Chloe, what on earth? I ju- I have no idea what that was. Was that a joke? Your office is pitch black, where are you? W-“ John was interrupted by her frantic words.

“No, John. God. You didn’t understand me.” John stayed silent. “I was quiet bec- I thought h-he might hear me over your phone. I’m fine, John. I’m in my car. The printing wasn’t important. It was just something before going home.. but.. when I was walking out, I saw that man enter your block and I had to get away. That’s what I meant, John. He’s in there with you, not me.”"
dusl6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dusl6k/the_neighbors_house/,The neighbor's house,24,0,1573480001.0,"
A boy of about ten years old always looked at the neighbor's house from his window. Every day without exception. The dreary house across the street intrigued him and, apparently, generated a dark and imperious need for him to discover the secret was in there.

The child spent hours at dawn, and even in the morning, watching a thick fog settle, dancing in the garden of the sinister property; as if it were a cemetery extracted from an old horror movie. I didn’t know the boy's name. I only knew that he hardly slept. Two months after he moved out, he discovered that, as he looked at the courtyard, a diffuse shadow watched him motionless from the upper-floor window. It looked like a statue; it was just there, watching. His gaze could penetrate the depths of the soul and delve into his dark secrets.

I remember that night. When the owner of the house left at dawn with a travel bag, he would be away for a while. I saw the boy, watching from the window of his room. It was his chance, he could overcome his fears and satisfy his furious curiosity. To discover the truth about the tenebrous house. He waited for his parents to fall asleep and went out alone with a flashlight. What a laugh he gave me! The child went to fight his dark fears with a flashlight. What innocence and naivety do when you are a child is incredible. 

The boy tried to open the door and, to his surprise, the door was open. He entered the house with his powerful flashlight in hand. As soon as he took two steps into this pigsty, he saw a black cat staring at him, whipping his tail violently from side to side. It didn't take long for the boy to see the shadow cast by the cat: The same shadow that looked down on him from the window. 

When the boy tried to go out, it was already late. 

The cat uttered an eerie scream that shook the child's soul. The door behind him closed. The boy ran as fast as he could with his fragile legs, opened and closed a couple of doors, cried and climbed the stairs, but there was no case. The cat was in front of him wherever he went, looking at him and smiling with that mocking grin of the disturbed souls. The flashlight was no longer useful. He tried to illuminate the shadow, and the light was swallowed up and devoured a thousand times by the shadow that took on a life of its own. Weeping and shouting could be heard in the house. It all belonged to the child. 

The cat approached him, he couldn't stand the whining anymore. The boy ran again, but this time he didn’t run down the stairs. The idiot jumped and hit the ground with his stupid body. If the house were alive, it would have screamed in pain. At that moment the shadow grew and became so big that it covered the walls; the cat approached slowly, gloating; he was ready to swallow him. The shadow began to cover the boy from his feet, savoring him slowly.

When everything seemed to end, the door opened, and the shadow receded. Two policemen ruined the beautiful moment of the end of existence. 

""Here is the lost child,"" said one policeman.

""What's he doing here? If this house has been abandoned for decades,"" said another. 

They grabbed the child and also the cat.

""Poor cat, abandoned in this dirty house, who knows how he survived.""

The child survived. He was in the hospital for a few days and, when he was discharged, his parents told him they were waiting for him with a surprise. What a surprise! 

When he saw the present, he let out a desperate scream that stunned the whole family.

Silly child, how can you be afraid of a poor, helpless cat that was given to you as a pet?"

“I can’t tonight, I need to finish my presentation before the deadline!” I explained, out of breath, to my coworker who asked me out for drinks.

My entire life was an endless rush, going from one place to the next with seemingly no time in between.

The same routine, every day since my first day of work. I stayed up all-hours, out of time to submit the tasks given to me. I’d wake up late the next morning because of it, out of time to make it to work when the day started.

“I'm sorry, sir, but I'm going to be l—” I began to exclaim, when the same old man grabbed my shoulder with a firm grip, one that seemed to stop time where it stood.

“Son,” he said softly, “don't you wish that, for once in your life, you could have time?”

I should’ve said no. I should’ve seen something like this coming, and ran away. But I was desperate. Desperate to get my life back on track. So I said yes, shutting out the rational part of my brain, only having hope, blocking out the obvious warning signs.

The old man smirked. “As you wish.”

You know how “time flies when you’re having fun”? Or how the seconds seem to pass like hours when you’re doing something you wish you weren’t? There’s a person to control that. That person is me. I’ve been sitting in this room for what seems like centuries now, monitoring every person’s time, adjusting their clocks in accordance with their activities.

So yeah, I have time.

All the time in the world, as a matter of fact."
dus99k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dus99k/the_second_noel/,The Second Noel,27,2,1573478300.0," We were careful; so diligent to make sure all candy and sweets were put away before bedtime. The Gingerbread house we made together the night before was placed in the highest cupboard in the house, well out of a five-year old’s reach. 

The usual clatter of our Daughter Noel’s footsteps and exclamations about presents never came that Christmas morning. Instead, my wife Maureen and I were met with dead silence. A sinister aura permeated through the air. 

Two green monster slippers twitched in different directions; a signal of our little girl’s struggle with whatever had caused her to fall to the kitchen floor. 

“Noel?”

No answer. 

My wife ran over to her and crouched down on the floor. 

“Bobby!” She wailed. “She’s choking! Oh my god, her lips are turning blue.”

I had her off the floor and well into the first steps of the Heimlich maneuver in less than twenty seconds. All the while, Maureen’s sobbing hysterically in my ear. 

“Bob, no! You’re Not supposed to do it like that. She’s too little; you’re gonna hurt her ribs!” 

In the adrenaline of the situation I find myself shouting back.  My hands are shaking so badly that I can barely keep them grasped together under her tiny frame. I’d say my heart was beating faster than my breath could keep up with, if I couldn’t feel it shattering more every second that Noel didn’t take a breath. 

“I’m trying to save our daughter’s life! Ribs won’t matter if I don’t clear this airway in the next thirty seconds. God knows how long she’s been out here like this!” 

Maureen fumbles through her purse and the contents of the clusterfuck that is our kitchen counter, searching for her phone to call 911. 

“Lift her up by the feet and pound her back Bob!” She demands. 

The moment I go to respond, a sharp, jagged shard of something flies into my left eye. My right eye watches as it falls to my lap and rolls to the very floor I picked Noel up off of not moments ago; a fucking peppermint. Our little girl almost lost her life over a goddamned peppermint. We had used them to decorate the roof; Santa’s shingles Noel called them. One must have rolled off when we were putting it away last night. 

Noel’s face goes through a barrage of colors until it returns to its usual pink state. She’s coughing quite a bit. Maureen and I are both crying at this point; clutching our daughter to our chests like she’d float away if we ever let go. 

“Jesus Christ sweetheart, you really scared us. Can you breathe okay?” 

Our little darling nodded her head. 

“Are you sure?” Maureen asked. Pulling her in for an even tighter hug before giving her a chance to answer. “I love you Noel.” 

She pulls away from us. Her face looks the same as our little girl’s always has, but her eyes are oddly different. There’s a subtle change that I can’t place. As she opens her tiny mouth to speak, her irises turn black. The voice that follows comes out in a deep, menacing rumble. 

“Noel isn’t here anymore.”"

Stephanie cringed at the sudden outburst, jolted out of her studious concentration by a high-pitched scream. 

Something had happened. That much was clear. A glitch in the program, which was supposed to realistically mimic the human voice. 

She clicked on the screen a few times. Nothing happened. 

“Ayudales! Ayudales!” 

The voice continued, distorting with each passing cycle. Degrading into tones and beeps that hurt her ears. 

Bits of pain bled through its mechanical roots. 

Stephanie shuddered. 

It was realistic, almost too realistic. Like somebody was actually screaming, pleading in another language. 

“Ayudales! Ayuda—Eliminar esto! Eliminarnos!” 

The text on screen flickered. In its place, new words had appeared. She couldn’t choose an answer though. There were no answers displayed. 

No way the program could be stopped, the voice prevented from reading the question out loud. 

“Eliminar esto! Eliminarnos!” 

Stephanie stared, taking it all in.

“Eliminar esto! Eliminarnos!” 

She sighed. 

“Eliminar esto! Eliminarnos!” 

Then, she turned off the computer. 

She had other things to do, some of which were much more important than a glitching program.

Far above, a dark angular shape bobs up and down, drifting lazily around the undulating shape of the Sun.

I felt sorry for Santiago.

As he would walk the warm sand with bad rum swimming in his blood, staring out at the Moon-light dancing on the wave crests, his gaze lost and held by the dark of the sea.

I know why he took his row-boat out, the oars dipping softly in the gentle waters, lonely flakes of blue paint peeling on the hull, rotted tackle box that no longer even smelt of sardines.

When he was pushing the boat from the beach he felt a sharp pain enter his foot, all the way into the bone of his heel, and cursed.

I know how he felt as he drifted further and further away, the light and noise of life on the island growing smaller till only a murmur remained.

How, out in the dark he could think only of the past and felt that was all there was left. All the time the pain and stiffness in his foot growing up his leg as it lay in the warm salt water in the bottom of the boat; full of tiny, nourishing life.

I know the confusion in the bleaching morning Sun, when his leg was now hard as rock and tiny white spires were growing through the skin, and new ones were starting to protrude through the flesh; higher and higher up his body.

I know the strange compulsion he felt, the draw of the dark, the call of the soothing lapping of the waves against the timbers of his boat. The strength it took to pull his stiffening body over the side, sinking down through eddies and currents, coming to rest on the sea floor.

I know how it felt when the breath of the old body left it, only for the new breath to begin, a billion breathes.

I know because I was Santiago once.

But I’m so much more now."

It was dead quiet and there was scarcely any light coming from anywhere except the rare few houses with their lights still on and the lamp posts. I was walking around the bend underneath an ominous flickering light when I caught some movement in the corner of my eye. It was like pure shadow had lept from behind a wall and into another. After staring at the same spot for a while I shrugged it off and continued home thinking nothing of it. Big mistake.

I next saw it while I was taking a shower a week later. I closed my eyes for a few seconds to wash out the shampoo when I caught another flicker of darkness except this time I was in an illuminated bathroom. I wrenched my eyes open ignoring the searing shampoo and saw something staring at me from behind the crack in the door. Just for a split second i stared into its milky white eyes. Then it dissapeared.

To this day I have never figured out what it was but I know it isnt anything friendly. How do I know this? Well I always sense something hostile from it and it always shows up after I take care of another victim."

We're led out onto the field of play, knee high mascots living our dream before whatever devours us from the inside can claim it.

 A tall blond grips my hand. Similarly constrained kids line up and we face each other, a troop of stunted misfits in team colours, dwarfed by our healthy counterparts.

For the first time, I feel an intense surge of familial love for the bald boys who get to jump the queue at Disney, the slack-chinned girls with fringed pennants and Alice bands. For the rest, a contrasting stab of contempt. As we parade in ceremony, it is suddenly, appallingly clear. 

""This isn't about us!"" I address my sickly kin. ""It's for them."" I tug at my handler's shirt and he glances down, his lips forming a sneer-shaped *shhh*. His grip loosens and I shrug free. 

Blondy's hand snakes out, caught between detaining me and breaking protocol. ""Don't make a scene.""

'God Save the Queen' swells up in a plangent drone, sucking in the crowd, heightening their fervour. Partisan flags. Painted faces. Ketchup grins.

The freedom is rain on my face, a breath of exhilarating air. I hobble for the centre spot, kicking up chalk. A crow's wing flaps at my good eye. Black sleeves billowing, knees pumping as the official makes a grab. I notice the whistle between his teeth, his game face crumpled with anger and embarrassment. It gives me a giggling jolt of adrenaline. 

Sections of the crowd point and jeer. Whoops of approval, defiling the pomp. It spurs me on, tongue lolling between my jaws. Blood swimming down my chin, splotching the hallowed shirt.

Back at the touchline, a girl in opposition garb wrenches her nose tube free. A spindly lad unbuckles the straps of his calipers. It has begun. Chaos consuming order, slow and rampant as a swathe of mutant cells.

 Cameras swoop in with dilated pupils and I see myself on the big screen, a jaundiced, baleful hyena. The herd grows tense behind hoardings, my brisk lollop magnified in grainy celluloid and the players experience that first, irrational trickle of fear. Chanting subsides, mouths hang agape while the hotdogs congeal in greasy wrappers.

 My pack convenes, a palsied mottle of fur, girded by hidden knowledge. We advance, hackles raised, our numbers swelling by the second. The chemicals in our blood impart a preternatural boost, evening the odds. We have nothing to fear. This isn't about us.

The players mill about in a skittish huddle. Gelled manes twitching, eyes darting and watchful. We are patient, wheeling under the canopy of stars and the night's tense hush until the inevitable straggler breaks loose and we fall to in a chittering, bristling ruck.

 The referee's whistle is shrill enough to wake me, but not before I understand that a shift is complete."

My name is David Smith. I came here three(?) days ago. At least I think it was three days ago. There's really no way to tell in here. 

I came here with my friends, Cal and Elijah. We thought it'd be really fun to smoke a blunt and go to the art gallery stoned. It actually was great at first. The weed made the art look cooler and we kept quiet enough that people wouldn't complain about us.

After a couple of hours, we decided to leave. We turned around and walked back through the winding corridors, but every way we went just kept leading to different art display rooms and more connected hallways. There were no signs, any stairs we found just led to more sections of art. We convinced ourselves we were just paranoid because of the weed and that we'd sober up soon and everything would be fine. 

After a few more hours, we had sobered up, but still couldn't find a way out. Our phones had no signal. We had been walking for hours.
Then we saw the first painting. 

It was in its own room in the gallery, and took up the entire wall. It was a graphically detailed Renaissance style painting of a man with no face being physically castrated in a medieval looking dungeon. 

The painting terrified the three of us, and we kept walking, determined to find a way out of this nightmare. We tired ourselves out eventually, and decided that we'd set up camp, and sleep on it, and we'd find a way out in the morning.

When we woke up, Cal was gone. Elijah and I ran back through the art gallery screaming his name, looking through every room we could trying to find him.
We ran right back into the room with the painting from before. Only now it had a face. 

It was definitely still the same painting from before, but the face was definitely Cal's. And it was twisted into a look of agonized horror. 

At this point, Elijah and I fell into full blown hysteria. We had no idea what to do. Our phones wouldn't work, not even for calling 999. Every fire alarm in the building was a dud, and no matter how far we ran, there was no end to this place.

Then we found the next painting.
Another room dedicated to an intricately detailed depiction of a faceless man being dismembered. Maybe you know the feeling by now. Knowing that somehow, this is where you're going to end up. Even though we hadn't eaten for over a day, we spent a good hour puking our guts up.

And somehow, we tired ourselves out enough to fall asleep. 

I woke up this morning. Alone.
I couldn't help but go back, just to confirm what I already knew was true. It was there. Elijah's horrified face painted perfectly onto the canvas.

I can't bring myself to go on any more. I don't want to see what my painting will be. I'll find out soon enough. 
I don't know if this place is hell or not. I don't know if I've done something to deserve this or we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

So if you find this, I'm sorry but there's no hope. There's no escaping this. Maybe you found your painting already. Maybe you've seen mine nearby. 
I'm sorry."

You look around. You try to look around. You're certain that there is more here than a tree. You can't seem to focus on anything except the tree. It's the only thing in focus, even though you feel like you still can't quite clearly see it, yet. You go closer to the tree.  

You realize now that ever since your senses started to return, a piercing wail fills the air, like the sound of a thousand tiny infants crying out for their mother. It seems to grow louder the more the tree comes into focus.  

There's something hanging from that tree. It's still hazy. There are many things hanging from that tree. The wailing gets louder.

Your eyes crawl up the trunk of the tree. Something flows down it. It's too dark to tell what it is. The wailing hurts. You gaze towards the branches and see the horror that awaits you.  

From each branch of the tree, the corpse of a small child hangs bloated and dead. Hung at the neck by a black rope. The wailing pierces your soul, the sound of a thousand infants who will never again cry for their mother shatters your mind as each tiny body swings dead in an unfelt breeze.

I regret the loss of my loved ones to age but, you know, I move on. I have forever. I have a good time, and I move on, and I remember them. It’s sad, but who doesn’t lose people?

It’s not the need to keep my eternal life secret, either. Would you believe someone was immortal? You’ve all seen those photos, where someone stands next to painting of “them” from the middle ages. They’re jokes. Do you know which ones are real? Of course you don’t.

I “age well”, and when it gets suspicious, I move on. I’ve had a lot of practice.

It’s not boredom either. I get bored sometimes. Don’t you? It’s not so bad. There are a lot of new things over eternity.

Ah, you say. it’s entropy. The sun will go out, the earth will decay, the atoms will fall apart and you’ll be left alone in the universe. And you’re getting closer.

It’s not something I’m looking forward to, I’ll grant you

But it beats the alternative.

You see, to be immortal- really immortal- you need to die, and then escape the afterlife. Very few people can do that. Maybe a dozen in human history. There’s no way to free anyone else- we’ve tried. We’ve had forever, and found nothing.

So that’s the problem with immortality. The guilt and the helplessness

Because I know what’s going to happen to all of you in a few short decades. I’ve seen the place you’re all going.

And I have to live forever with the fact I have no way of saving any of you from it."

That sort of love that latches multiple arms around your brain and sticks its hands into the deep ridges of your mind. 

The way that your blushing flesh will fold onto its palms, the way it'll clench its fists in that same feeling. 

The way that it'll crawl down from your throat and into your lungs, sharpened fingernails scratching at that endless valley of skin

That type of love will watch, record your skin being divided into half and splitting after it's cut.

When it's almost done, it will crawl out of your stomach, usually peeking its head out of your belly button, and then pushing its entire body through. The hole in your stomach will be unevenly ripped and open, bleeding chunky, semi-digested food fluids. 

You'll be lying on your back when it happens, face flushed, hair messily sticking to your face and mouth gaping. If you focus long enough, you'll feel it crawl down from your legs, and away, and then finally, inevitably, gone.

That dirty, sticky kind of love."

When I got closer I observed it was a book. The cover had words written in a weird language. As I read from the book I felt a cold breeze passing through me and I heard someone calling my name. I thought it was just my imagination, but I was still frightened by what had happened. Therefore I hurried my pace in order to get home as fast as possible. 

It was late when I arrived home and I was very tired so I fell asleep immediately. I woke up in the middle of the night as something touched my legs. I quickly got out of the bed and turned on the lights, but when I looked, nothing was there. I was very scared and I couldn't sleep anymore so I decided to go outside and take a walk. As I was closing the door I saw a black, thin silhouette standing in the hallway. I was unable to move my body while the silhouette was approaching me. I screamed from the top of my lungs and then I woke up. Fortunately it seems that it was just a nightmare. 

The next day, when I was walking on the street, the same silhouette appeared in front of me. But no one could see it besides me even though it was pretty crowded. I tried to ignore to ignore it as I was thinking I going crazy, but it started following me! 

At some point it lost me and when I got home I decided to burn the book so that the weird things would hopefully stop, but it actually made it worse. That night, I woke up when the silhouette was calling my name. 

I began to scream and then the creature threw its cape and I realized it was me! "

“I don’t have time for your games. The world is under attack from something we don’t fully understand and the best information you have for me is that you drive a stake through the heart of these things like some vampire, or use garlic”

“They both worked, didn’t they? You saw it with your own eyes”

“I don’t know what I am seeing. Preliminary data suggests that even the form of these things changes. It is like our vision isn’t calibrated for what we are seeing.”

“Exactly. We can’t believe our eyes anymore. We are facing something that is truly alien, not just some humanoid form born out of the mind of Arthur C. Clarke.”

“But why stake?”

A sharp light illuminates the room. Shimmering. Piercing. Hypnotic.

A silhouette dampens the blaze. The shadow stretches and takes a form. Wings? You can’t believe your eyes anymore. A voice rises, piercing the light like an arrow through the photons.

Everyone has a noose tied around their neck. 

It’s not a metaphor. You literally have a noose around you right now. It seems like I’m the only one that can see it though. The nooses differ from person to person. Some nooses are so loose they almost fall of them. Some are so tight it looks like the person could suffocate at any minute.

I first thought it meant that the person was about to die, but I was wrong. It dawned on me when I started to see my best friends noose tightening when we were 16. It began small, just a little tighter every day. Sometimes it looked looser, but the next day it had tightened up again.

She jumped off a roof at 17. I blamed myself. I had seen the noose tightening but I did nothing. I realized what it meant: the tighter the noose was, the closer the person was to ending their life.

So when I saw the noose tightening around my classmate’s neck, I wasn’t going to sit and watch him die. I befriended him, listened to all his problems. He started to become happier and his noose started to loosen. We even began dating. We were both so happy.

That was unti I woke up one morning and looked into a mirror. There was a noose around my neck. I had never seen it on myself before. And it looked tight. 

I tried to ignore it. We kept dating, I made sure his noose wouldn’t tighten again. But my own noose got tighter and the space between the rope and my neck smaller every day. 

One night we had a fight. A big one. He was drunk and I got mad. I’m not proud of it, but I called him pretty horrible names and stormed out. As I was walking away from my house and wiping tears from my face, I gasped.

Breathing became easier. The noose started to get more relaxed. I learned a new, horrifying rule to my power: If I helped others, I would condemn myself to death. But if I decraded others, drove them closer to the edge…

I would get to live.

I want you to know that I tried to make it work. Find a perfect balance between helping others and staying alive. I apologized and told my boyfriend I loved him. I yelled at a cashier. I started chatting to people online, sending death threats to strangers. Anything to keep me and my loved ones safe.

“I’m home!” I yelled. I took my jacket of and sighed.

“Welcome home my love”, my boyfriend smiled and kissed me. 

“I have a surprise for you”, he whispered. 

Before I could answer, he got down on one knee and took out a ring. My heart jumped.

“Will you marry me and make me the happiest man on this earth?” 

“Yes!” I exlaimed. I only realized my mistake after I fell to the ground, gasping for air.

Oh fuck."

I saw she had a rope around her neck that reached the ceiling. I stood still staring on her front lawn.

One sunny morning 2 days before the Christmas Eve I woke up and the roads were covered with snow. White and beautiful snow. I didn't eat breakfast , or brush my teeth. I just dressed up wore my coat and went out to built a snowman. But my parents had already woken up. 
""Were are you going young lady ?""my father asked. He liked to call me young lady. 
""I am going to build a snowman!"" I said filled with excitement. ""You didn't eat breakfast."" My mother told me. Then she looked me with a wide smile on her face and said "" But, you can eat after you build your snowman ."" I kissed them both and ran out in our garden which wasn't green any more but white covered with snow. 

It didn't take long to finish. I had made my snowman in 10 minutes. He was beatiful. I stil see him in my dreams . He always says the same words with that sadistic smile on his face

Hillary, as a good paranormal investigator, listened attentively to Kate's report.

""My son, Jack, he says some strange things looking to our clock. Gary thinks Jack is sick or something, but I think is something like... A demon"" Kate said scared.

Hillary kindly wrote Kate's words.

""Ok, but, what Jack says besides..."" Hillary was quiet for a moment, just to listen to Jack's words.

""Ascend, Time"".

Kate was quiet, looking to Hillary's eyes.

""Just this,"" Kate said.

""Does he have any mental illness?"" Hillary asked.

A deep silence covered the room.

""Hillary, your fucking bitch... You are identical to my husband!"" Kate screamed.

""Kate, keep yourself calm,"" Hillary said.

Kate got up from the chair and threw Hillary's equipment all over the floor.

""Calm? Calm?! My son...!"" Kate was interrupted by a loud beat.

Jack was beating his head against the wall.

""It's time!"" Jack screamed.

Suddenly a creature left the clock, saying unknown words.

""Hadesale troact seleretai ryatu Beat"" the creature said.

Hillary got a book from the floor.

""Wait, I know what it is,"" Hillary said.

Jack felt to the floor, apparently dead.

""Jack!"" Kate screamed.

""Kate, come here,"" Hillary said.

No reaction.

""Kate!"" Hillary screamed again.

No reaction.

""Here!"" Hillary screamed - ""The time has come in the form of a beast to destroy you all"" Hillary read.

Suddenly... Silence.

Hillary opened the door, looking for dangerous things or something, but nothing.

A scream echoed all over the house.

The clock shivered gently and fell.

Hillary's body was never found, but Time still running all over the world, killing people and destroying happy moments.

And the creature? Oh, he's Time.

Jack and Kate's body looks like an 80 years old person's body, they died of old age, don't worry.

I blinked my heavy eyes, and saw stretched before me a sea of people in the impenetrable darkness.

They slept; some soundly, others restlessly, in stretches and curls and rows and stacks.

Some whistled softly, while others gave great sighs. A chorus of unwitting, disembodied voices, singing their dreams and worries.

I felt fear, because I did not want to sleep. If I slept again, I would not know.

But as my body laid back down onto the cold, rocky floor, a persistent fatigue shushed me back to oblivion.

And as my eyes closed once more, I let out a whimper in the darkness amidst the great chorus of sleeping voices."

It had been off. He remembered pressing the switch as he nodded, telling himself he'd stumble to bed, but instead passing out in his seat. Yet pale blue light shimmered from the screen, creating a clear boundary between him and the surrounding dark. 

He rubbed his eyes, widened them, and noticed a single post shining red against a black background. 

It read:

Upvote if You Want Us to Eat Him

""The fuck..."" Tim said, before noticing a subtle shift of light in the lone arrow beside the link, transforming the 1 into a 2. 

He went to close the page, but found no way to X it out. A trickle of light, and the arrow blinked again, changing 2 into 3. 

Tim pressed the monitor's switch, watching the screen die with a comforting release in his chest. 

The monitor blinked to life. 13 upvotes shone red against black. 

Tim stood, trying to comprehend, when pain seared through his arm. He cried out and turned, seeing nothing in the surrounding gloom. Heat seeped down his forearm, and he looked and found blood pouring from a tiny wound. 

He hurried to the kitchen sink, dampening a paper towel and wiping the blood away, when four fangs closed around his Achilles' heel and tore it out in a mass of blood, flesh, and agony. 

Tim screamed and fell, struggling to focus through sublime pain. He tried to stand, wailed, and fell to his knees, crawling towards the phone at his computer desk. 

He picked it up and lost two fingers to jaws clamping and tearing in a single motion. He fell backwards, howling, and through terror, through agony, spied the upvote arrow jolting electric, as if caught upon a mad current, the number rising into a blur. 

He heard them before he saw them, the slither of their corrupted flesh, the tick of their insectile legs, a menagerie of abominations with frothing jaws and glistening teeth erupting out of the darkness to devour him. 

He howled, wailed, gargled, died. 

His last exhale signaled the final upvote, an arbitrary number signifying nothing save the last moments of a life, a corpse lying in the glow of electric light, devoured eyes staring at a link smirking crimson from a sliver of the void."

I was sitting in my room when it happened. The same room that I have been living in for the last 10 years with no escape. I’ve got books, food and drink and was well looked after but I've never been permitted to leave my room, they say its for my own safety but I’m unsure of that. 

I can only tell you what I heard because like I said I’ve never been permitted to leave my room until now. This is what I told the police officer who found me, who was the first person aside from my parents that I’d seen in 10 long years. 

I heard a knock at the door, but my small window is too high in the wall for me to see out of. 

I heard some muffled talking, then my mother screaming and the whole house shook as it would during an earthquake 

I then heard my father yelling and begging and then the house shook again. 

And then silence until.... 

I heard someone walking up the stairs to my room, then there was a bright light and the click of the lock. 

I was cowering in the corner of my room, scared and wondering what this whatever it was; was going to do to me. 

Then I heard them walking back down the stairs and the sound of the door closing. 

I was sitting in my room for a while wondering if the person was going to come back. 

I finally crept to the door of my room and turned the handle and pushed on it and it opened. 

I then slowly walked down the attic stairs from my room to where my parents were lying dead on the floor. 

There didn’t seem to be any noticeable cause for their death except for the fact that their eyes were wide open and it seemed as though their eyes were burned out and of course the fact that they weren’t breathing. 

At first I was horrified but then joyful that this mysterious stranger had freed me from the isolation and abuse I’d been subjected to over the last 10 years that I ran from the house screaming they’re dead and I’m finally free! 

Of course the police officer didn’t believe me and now I’m locked in a different room unsure of when or if I’ll ever be free again."
