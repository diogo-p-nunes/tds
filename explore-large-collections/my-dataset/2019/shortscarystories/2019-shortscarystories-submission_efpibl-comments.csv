fc1y26m,t3_efpibl,"Tfw you're so ugly you scream when you saw yourself.

Ugliness aside, cool little short story. Hearing knocking on doors when staying up late is honestly terrifying, because you don't know who's standing on the other side, and what their intention is. The ""seeing myself"" part is pretty nice too, since doppleganger is one of my favourite ideas for horror story.  Nice one.",t3_efpibl
fc22bdl,t1_fc1y26m,Hahaha Although I myself am pretty ugly (maybe that's the reason my ex hub dumped me lol) essentially as u stated it's her doppelganger. I also like the subject of doppelgangers and have seen other peoples doubles (true story). It was from the corner of my eyes and swore this particular person entered the area behind the counter (this was at work) and realized she didn't.,t3_efpibl
fc23phx,t1_fc22bdl,"Don't bring yourself down mate! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and although the beholder sounds like some scary eldritch thingy, I'm sure you're beautiful in one way or another!

Sometime I also think I saw a certain someone walking right by me, but then when I asked them later, they were actually nowhere close to where I am. Maybe just a trick of the light or something, but scary nonetheless :p",t3_efpibl
fc29lby,t1_fc23phx,"Ty for your kind words and yeah def the eye of the beholder. Anyway, did you see them in your peripheral or directly? I sometimes think seeing someone's double is a glitch maybe?",t3_efpibl
fc2l7m8,t1_fc29lby,"Peripheral. If it's directly, I'd be scared :p",t3_efpibl
fc2wqc6,t1_fc2l7m8,"Omg I dont even know why I ask you that of course peripheraly haha Did I tell you I'm dumb too?  Anyway, that would be frightening to see directly.",t3_efpibl
fc31qps,t1_fc2wqc6,"Haha, no worries about it, I'm dumb too! Yeah, but as frightening as it is, I would enjoy seeing my doppleganger! Have a nice day mate, and keep on writing!",t3_efpibl
fc32eyw,t1_fc31qps,Ty! And btw you're not dumb.,t3_efpibl
