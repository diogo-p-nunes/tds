Please explain this.",t3_e22n1k
f8tqug5,t3_e22n1k,What?,t3_e22n1k
f8uf9x1,t3_e22n1k,Nice T E X T,t3_e22n1k
f8ugx0z,t3_e22n1k,Huh?,t3_e22n1k
f8tww2n,t1_f8toyuu,"Thinking his wife died during childbirth so he took her and the baby home, set fire to the house, put the baby inside to die and then joined his wife’s body back in the car?",t3_e22n1k
f8uwz7l,t1_f8tp476,"She is only in his head, she died during childbirth,  he tries to kill himself multiple times but she is punishing him everytime he tries",t3_e22n1k
f8uxljv,t1_f8tqug5,"The number three has a lot of meaning in this text, he tries to kill himself three times, they are three people (tho she is only in his head), while she talks to him multiple times she only whisperes three times, in the final dialogue the word ""together"" appears three times (once in each sentence), there are three main events (burning the house, killing his son, staying in the car and waiting for the cops), her final sentence is ""I love you"" wich is made up of three words",t3_e22n1k
f8vbz1x,t1_f8uf9x1,"Is this Ironic, I mean I know I'm not that good at writing, but I really liked this idea and I tried to explore it the best I could...:))",t3_e22n1k
f8uww6z,t1_f8tww2n,"Well obviously her body is not in the car, is only in his head, do you think they let u leave a hospital with a bleading body in the pasanger seat? XD

P.S. thx for understanding it tho",t3_e22n1k
f8vaqm3,t1_f8uxljv,That doesn't make the actual story less confusing.,t3_e22n1k
f8wllv3,t1_f8vbz1x,How do you make it look like that?,t3_e22n1k
f8v1xlq,t1_f8uww6z,"Oh ok! Well it wouldn’t be bleeding at that point from the hospital morgue haha. I thought it was in his head until the kissed her cold lips part and then the cops coming for him instead of the fire department. Unless he wasn’t supposed to take the kid or someone saw him put the baby in the house and called the cops super quickly. 
Great story to tho!",t3_e22n1k
f8vbh68,t1_f8vaqm3,"Well the holy trinity is made up of three entities, the father, the son, and the holy spirit, but in this dark story you have an antithetical trinity, a cursed trinity, the father kills his son instead of resurecting him, he punishes himself instead of cherishing. And the holy spirit (in this case the late wife) gives him orders instead of advices, that lead him onto the worse path not the batterment path.",t3_e22n1k
f8x2b95,t1_f8vbh68,"I guess that makes sense, but the text itself still baffles me. It seems like you put a lot of thought into it, though.",t3_e22n1k
