f8o12t9,t3_e1ab57,"OP this story gave me the creeps. I hope I never see red eyes, let alone ""fiery red eyes,"" when I glance at a mirror.  *Shudder.* I hope your good boy gets a nice treat when he gets home.  As for me, I'm covering up the mirrors in my bedroom. *Just in case.*",t3_e1ab57
f8omea6,t3_e1ab57,"Plot twist: that mirror dog was female and the dog is not fending it but it is actually her mate, but since she lives in a mirror(something that he can't reach) he just stares at It smiling",t3_e1ab57

f8okz15,t3_e1ab57,Animals are such a blessing in protecting us from what we cannot see. I love my meows. They bring a calming energy in my place now that I have them in my life.,t3_e1ab57
f8om7im,t3_e1ab57,Great story did not see the ending like that as i was reading it. Wow.,t3_e1ab57
f8sdnke,t3_e1ab57,"I particularly love how the narrator stares at their dog for 10 entire minutes in the middle of the night just like ""n'awwww""",t3_e1ab57
f8oxrsy,t3_e1ab57,"Give your dog a nice reward, and also call an exorcist. I get the feeling that changing the doors from glass to wood is only going to give the beast something tangible to get through. If the beast is attached to you instead of your home, then it's in fact YOU who needs the exorcism.",t3_e1ab57
f8p2hs6,t3_e1ab57,Scary stuff! Be glad you have a dog!,t3_e1ab57
f8plw5q,t3_e1ab57,This is why I wont sleep in a room with a mirror,t3_e1ab57
f8pkeii,t3_e1ab57,Im sorry but it was very predictable. Good story and writing tho.,t3_e1ab57
f8pr0bv,t3_e1ab57,This was great,t3_e1ab57
f8psxzf,t3_e1ab57,Brilliant!!,t3_e1ab57

f8q7wr2,t3_e1ab57,Good story I hate mirrors in bedrooms,t3_e1ab57
f8teln2,t3_e1ab57,"In Chinese superstitions if you have mirror facing you while you sleep, it would slowly suck out your soul",t3_e1ab57
f8un05h,t3_e1ab57,Ho damn that was scary.,t3_e1ab57
f8v1vi5,t3_e1ab57,"If the dog was actually guarding its owner, wouldn't it be growling/being threatening at the mirror? Asides from that minor nitpick, great story!",t3_e1ab57
f9edqw0,t3_e1ab57,"This actually scared me, good job!",t3_e1ab57
famxo75,t3_e1ab57,Hey I'm a narrator and I'm wondering if you would allow me to feature this on my channel sometime.,t3_e1ab57
f8omr6d,t3_e1ab57,My dog jumped off my bed while reading this. Eek,t3_e1ab57
f8oucai,t1_f8o12t9,"I had to replace my digital alarm clock when I was a kid because it had bright glowing red letters. The position of it was just right so that it reflected off something to create the appearance of glowing red eyes staring at you

Scared the shit out of me as a kid and even though I figured out it was just the alarm clock, I replaced the thing because those glowing red numbers were never the same after that",t3_e1ab57

f8pqfsr,t1_f8ow8h4,"I agree, it confused me as well. But great story if I forget the part about the hotel. Good job",t3_e1ab57
f8sm8y3,t1_f8ow8h4,"I had to reread that part a few times. I think OP jumped into the present tense to mean ""I am now in a hotel until tomorrow when I can pick up my dog"" then went back to the past tense to describe why they are in a hotel. They were home, creepy dog mirror beast came, now they're at a hotel.",t3_e1ab57
