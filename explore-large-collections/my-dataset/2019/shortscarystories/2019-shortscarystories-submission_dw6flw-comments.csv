f7i122h,t3_dw6flw,"Very well done, I thought it was gonna be something like dehydration, but this was far more intriguing. Good job!",t3_dw6flw
f7jlhp6,t3_dw6flw,"I read once about an old torture method where people would tie someone down, put rats in a bucket over the persons stomach and heat up the other side, the rats, desperately trying to get away from the heat would chew and claw through the stomach trying to get out.

Sorry. This just kind of reminded me of that.",t3_dw6flw
f7hb769,t3_dw6flw,Ouch!,t3_dw6flw
f7ikzsf,t3_dw6flw,Always check the back seat,t3_dw6flw
f7jegin,t3_dw6flw,"Dishonored 3 got really dark.

Great job.",t3_dw6flw
f7j8ped,t3_dw6flw,The formatting doesn't seem necessary or fit for the story. Definitely took away from the experience for me and I ended up skipping to see how long it would go on which was all the way. Even unnecessary line breaks in sentences which causes the flow to be lost.,t3_dw6flw
f7hribc,t3_dw6flw,Holy shit this is terrifying. Well done,t3_dw6flw
f7ipgrw,t3_dw6flw,Now that’s fucking horror holy shit good job,t3_dw6flw

f7k50u2,t3_dw6flw,Yes.,t3_dw6flw
f7kda3w,t3_dw6flw,This is bone-chilling. Amazing job. I love the poetic structure.,t3_dw6flw
f81tgg1,t3_dw6flw,Why is it written out in this format? Don’t get me wrong I think the story is great but it’s really difficult to read all spaced out and have no idea why you didn’t just write it out in paragraphs. I think it would have read much better,t3_dw6flw
f83vyot,t3_dw6flw,"I love this, good job",t3_dw6flw
f890l8o,t3_dw6flw,That's fucked up. *upvotes*,t3_dw6flw
fc38rmv,t3_dw6flw,Why did you choose this format? I don’t really like it. It confuses me quite a lot and I didn’t understand half of it,t3_dw6flw
fgqc86p,t3_dw6flw,Im not scared of creepypasta easily anymore. But THIS. This terrified me. One of my favorites on this sub so far,t3_dw6flw
fh0uplf,t3_dw6flw,"This is like that one part of a book called *Touching Spirit Bear*.

>!It’s like the part where Cole was lying on the floor helpless after being mauled and noticed his arm was completely covered by mosquitoes. His arm was completely numb, so he couldn’t feel anything, and he was too weak to do anything about it.!<

It’s a really good book. I recommend it. And it’s not very long; only 28 chapters that contain 3-6 pages each.",t3_dw6flw

f7k087e,t3_dw6flw,Did anyone else wonder why tears were streaming down the captor’s face?,t3_dw6flw
f8vttzh,t3_dw6flw,This sounds like a typical Dishonored stealth run.,t3_dw6flw
fn5fn2m,t3_dw6flw,More twists than I can count on my fingers and toes.,t3_dw6flw
f7iu1sc,t1_f7h2318,"Cats will supposedly eat corpses if they're hungry enough, so which is better? Lol",t3_dw6flw
f8y4amv,t1_f7h2318,"Lol I’d probably take swarm of rats over anything less than (maybe) 12 hungry cats...I feel like the cats would get full and take more breaks between eating me, than the rats. It’s a tough call, having more time to potentially be rescued with the cats, or a slightly less terrible/prolonged death...

But I do love cats..",t3_dw6flw

f7imbpu,t1_f7h5uju,I think it being broken and without meter adds to the sense of anxiety and claustrophobia.,t3_dw6flw

f7n711t,t1_f7mbcum,"Dogs tend to lick you to try and wake you up, trying to be helpful. When it becomes clear that this isn't working, they have a tendency to panic. Licking proceeds to nipping, which proceeds to biting. In an unfortunate amount of cases, the taste of blood causes their feeding instincts to kick in, and things get messy.",t3_dw6flw
