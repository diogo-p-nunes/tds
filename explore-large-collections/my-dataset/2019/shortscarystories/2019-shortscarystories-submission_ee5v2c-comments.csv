fbq2s6b,t3_ee5v2c,"Damn, optimistic and a little bit crazy? Sounds like my kind of girl!

My romantic interest aside, cool little story. I like the plot of a dead man having jobs to ruin other's life. I especially love how the story revolves around a person that can't be ruined, but at the same time, is pretty insane on her own. Good one!",t3_ee5v2c
fbq34m2,t3_ee5v2c,"Oh snap. That was really good, please keep wiriting!",t3_ee5v2c
fbr7yo3,t3_ee5v2c,"Man, I did not see that ending, great twist!",t3_ee5v2c
fbst8xt,t3_ee5v2c,Damn! Didn’t expect that at all! Well done!,t3_ee5v2c
fbt1f4a,t3_ee5v2c,This reminded me of 'The Screwtape Letters'. I hope your fate isn't as grim as Wormwood's!,t3_ee5v2c
fbq4eq6,t1_fbq2s6b,"I've dated a few that fit the profile... I think at least one did stab me through the heart, so maybe that was my inspiration?

Thank you! It's probably one of my favorite concepts. Especially when you can relate it to someone you work with. As much as this guy is your average ""meh... I'm here... I'll do enough not to get fired"" There's probably over achievers that take it way too seriously.

I think maybe all of the torture she endured with him trying to throw off her life created the psycho kill that ended up getting him fired. I'm sure she's whistling and singing ""Always think on the bright side of life"" as we speak!

Thank you again for the positive comments! I definitely appreciate them on my posts and others that I see as well!",t3_ee5v2c
fbqjlla,t1_fbq2s6b,"Bruh if a murderer is just ""a little bit crazy"" I don't want to know the girls you date",t3_ee5v2c
fbq4i0n,t1_fbq34m2,Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed it! Will do!,t3_ee5v2c
fbr8nbn,t1_fbr7yo3,Thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed it!!,t3_ee5v2c
fbstk1f,t1_fbst8xt,Thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed it! It was a fun one to write!,t3_ee5v2c
fbtvmef,t1_fbt1f4a,"Hopefully it doesn’t make me sound uncultured but I had to look it up. 

I read “The Chronicles of Narnia” and “The Space Trilogy”. Somehow I missed “The Scewtape Letters” I’m looking forward to reading it, 

I found his other works fascinating. It wouldn’t surprise me if some of his voice came through. I read them during an influential time of my life and found escaping into his fantasy realms very comforting!

Thank you for the recommendation!",t3_ee5v2c
fbq6wgo,t1_fbq4eq6,"I hope you and your heart are doing okay for now! Keep on writing so I can more fun writing these silly comments that some people probably hate, and have a nice day!

Forgot to reply to you and commented on the whole story lol",t3_ee5v2c
fbqk2oi,t1_fbqjlla,"Unfortunately I don't have one, and the one I'm close with consider me as a best friend :[",t3_ee5v2c
fbq8bor,t1_fbq6wgo,"Thank you again! I will! I think a lot of people enjoy your comments, I do. I haven't seen any get downvoted but it's a fact of putting anything online. Someone somewhere will find a reason to dislike something... lol

Have a great day and keep it up!!",t3_ee5v2c
fbqkrc2,t1_fbqk2oi,Probably because you have the hots for murderers,t3_ee5v2c
fbqkv4s,t1_fbqkrc2,"Huh, never thought about that. I'll change my preference to another evil traits then, thanks for the tips!",t3_ee5v2c
fbql1iv,t1_fbqkv4s,Best of luck! Can't wait to hear about your dating adventures (hopefully not on the news after she kills you).,t3_ee5v2c
fbqmwml,t1_fbql1iv,Sounds like a great plot for a short scary story!!!,t3_ee5v2c
fbrbsqq,t1_fbqmwml,Maybe you can make one with an interesting trait :D,t3_ee5v2c
