fc5u5cm,t3_egd3mu,"I always knew that there was a reason that seeing the results of people using Snapshot, gave me the creeps. I love the way you added that touch of realism in which the culpable CEO gets fired, yet receives a sinfully high severance package.  Good one OP.",t3_egd3mu
fc6owgi,t3_egd3mu,The last line was what truly got me. That was good!,t3_egd3mu

fc786p1,t3_egd3mu,This is good.,t3_egd3mu
fc7sx1i,t3_egd3mu,"Imagine getting fired and earning that much money. He was already earning more than enough as his salary. People say the world has changed from the times of nobility and peasants, but it hasn't.

Nice story too, lol. Sorry for the rant.",t3_egd3mu

fc928nc,t1_fc5u5cm,"How is he culpable. no one understands how this happened, by all rights it shouldnt have, its not like a company would go ""lets test magic filters that can kill people on our *public build*""",t3_egd3mu

fc9np1v,t1_fc928nc,"There have been numerous cases in which products were tested, and some not only have not worked as intended, but they had deadly consequences. A case in point, was the recent product of air bags that exploded and either seriously injured or killed the car passengers. Companies such as this, have ignored the injuries and deaths, and figured that it was cheaper to continue the product and pay off some people, than to pull the product. Executives such as this were quite culpable. In this manner the CEO could have been culpable for the results.",t3_egd3mu
fdinpvt,t1_fdincr1,It's freaky. Really Black Mirror-ish.,t3_egd3mu
fcc1ssk,t1_fc9np1v,"None of the victims here have been paid off, and ""a phone app made my face vanish"" is going to be a rather larger news cycle than someone dying due to a faulty airbag. this isnt ""is making an airbag safe going to cut into our profit margins"" its literally a button you press and the filters dont go out, theres no logistics cost.",t3_egd3mu
fdiodf0,t1_fdinpvt,Thank you. I love that show.,t3_egd3mu
