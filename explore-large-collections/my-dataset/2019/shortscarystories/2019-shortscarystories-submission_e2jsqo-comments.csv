f8vwb68,t3_e2jsqo,"Good one Thaleila. I *just knew* that her sister would be the next victim. What a wonderful twist! Looking forward to seeing more of your stories. 

Umm. This *was* fiction, *wasn't it?*",t3_e2jsqo
f8yh67m,t3_e2jsqo,"very good little narrative you put together here. I def thought she was gonna kill her sister in some onstage spectacle, which would have been boring and predictable. I loved the angle you took instead",t3_e2jsqo
