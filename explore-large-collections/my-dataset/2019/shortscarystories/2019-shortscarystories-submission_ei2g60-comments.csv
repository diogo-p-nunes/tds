Explosion aside, there's a typo for the word ""firework"" in the sixth paragraph, but other than that, it's a cool story. People like to eat the forbidden fruit, especially kids, and with that in mind, these kind of things could happen and end poorly with the kid being injured. Minus the sudden c-4 twist of course lol.

In my country, every year there's news about some dumb kid getting injured by firework, so thanks god they don't have access to a bomb.",t3_ei2g60
fcmz9xb,t1_fcmyzkp,"Aah, in my country every year we consider a ban on fireworks, and then decide not too.
Also, people in my country are stupid.
Like this one day they decide to blow up everything, trashcans, cars and those things you put the mail in (dunno what they are called in english)",t3_ei2g60

It's probably mailbox :p",t3_ei2g60
