f8qisv3,t3_e1nbtq,Is this Cinderella? (Currently at paragraph 2),t3_e1nbtq
f8r0wx9,t3_e1nbtq,"I like this a lot.  (I've always liked this bit of the Grimms' version of the tale.)  I find it really interesting how Disney has always changed the details in the classic fairy tales, and yet in some of them, they still manage to be just as horrifying and scary as the OG stories.  (eg Maleficent scared the CRAP out of me -- still does.  The only Disney villain who upset me that much as a child was Madam Medusa.)  


Feedback: I would actually omit Druscilla's name.  I say this because it evokes the Disney version of the film, and it makes it harder to imagine the scene actually playing out.  (This is more opinion than structural feedback.  But I think that if you leave the name out when you get to the last line, THAT is the reveal that the story is Cinderella, and up to that point, you just have someone watching her Mother mutilate her sister's feet for apparently no reason.)",t3_e1nbtq
f8qj0qy,t3_e1nbtq,For some reason Ol' Wally D left this part out of his adaptation,t3_e1nbtq
f8ru31c,t3_e1nbtq,Good story. You are an excellent author.,t3_e1nbtq
f8s97zd,t3_e1nbtq,"LoL, this sounds exactly like the ""real"" ending of cinderela, kudos!",t3_e1nbtq
f8sdria,t3_e1nbtq,She needs to go on a foot diet.,t3_e1nbtq
f8skesr,t3_e1nbtq,Wait what,t3_e1nbtq
f8qjh0r,t1_f8qisv3,"I guess there aren't a lot of Druscillas out there. Apparently, though, Diz the Wiz spelled it Drizella",t3_e1nbtq
f8qivlr,t1_f8qisv3,It is,t3_e1nbtq
f8v4r8h,t1_f8qisv3,it is,t3_e1nbtq
f8r1miv,t1_f8r0wx9,"Thanks Jum! I think you're probably right about omitting Druscilla's name until the end. I guess I hadn't realized the name was so uncommon as to immediately evoke the Disney film at its first mention. 

And yes, I do love the original gruesome versions, but sometimes Disney's changes are for the best. I remember my mom reading me and my sister the Little Mermaid when we were little, and getting to the part where she kills herself and turns into foam, and all of us being like... WTF, that's not the story!",t3_e1nbtq
f8r0e7g,t1_f8qj0qy,And the pecking out of the eyes at the end -- that was one of my favourite parts as a child...,t3_e1nbtq
f8s7ye2,t1_f8ru31c,"Aww, thanks Young!",t3_e1nbtq
f8sr46c,t1_f8skesr,"How else is she going to fit in the glass slippers, which is the only method by which the Prince can identify the woman he danced with the previous night, and ergo has chosen as his bride?",t3_e1nbtq
f8qlnx2,t1_f8qjh0r,No it's cuz it's famous that the original conderella had a sister cut off her toes because her feet were too big for the glass slipper,t3_e1nbtq
f8r21lx,t1_f8r1miv,"The only other Druscilla I know off the top of my head is the sister of the Roman Emperor Caligula.  And I can't actually recall the name of the other sister in the Disney film without looking it up.... But it's definitely not a common name, at least, not on my street.  


I love that you mentioned Little Mermaid too, because that's the first film I ever saw in cinemas (and boy howdy, Ursula is suuuuuper scary to a three-year-old), but I remember the reverse -- I remember telling my mum that the ending was wrong because even at the age of 3, I was a snotty little pedant and I'd already read The Little Mermaid.  It was the first story I read that DIDN'T have a 'happily ever after,' and apparently my inner emo/goth was already starting to wake up. :P",t3_e1nbtq
f8r0v4q,t1_f8r0e7g,Our ancestors had some weird ideas,t3_e1nbtq
f8s8tuk,t1_f8s7ye2,Your welcome,t3_e1nbtq
f8stq29,t1_f8sr46c,Yea got that after I looked it up and she's one of the ugly sisters with big feet.,t3_e1nbtq
f8qmfvq,t1_f8qlnx2,"Is it famous? I thought it was mostly unknown. Maybe my story needn't exist then, haha",t3_e1nbtq
f8r47lf,t1_f8r21lx,"I think the other one is Anastasia, which is a bit more common? There’s the Russian machine-gun victim, and isn’t that the Twilight girl’s name? Maybe I should have gone with Anastasia instead. I liked the sound of Druscilla better though :)

I wonder what the next Disney adaptation/bastardization will be. I loved Tangled, but only kind of liked Frozen.",t3_e1nbtq
f8rnuj1,t1_f8r21lx,"Anastasia, the other sister, the redheaded one in the Disney version is named Anastasia. Druscilla is the dark haired one. Know you didn't ask about the hair color, just another fun fact. :)",t3_e1nbtq
f8r1dwj,t1_f8r0v4q,"Seriously.  My favourite Grimms' Fairy Tale is actually Sweet Roland, which involved a girl who cut off the head of a witch's daughter, and dripped blood in different parts of the house, and when the witch came looking for her daughter, when she called, the blood would answer... I love how dark and twisted the original tales are.  Much better than the soft fluff we ended up getting from Disney in comparison.",t3_e1nbtq
f8ritgm,t1_f8qmfvq,"It's well known in the right circles.

But dude, every retelling has value. I like the way this plays out. Perfect pacing, and despite being short, builds a lovely sense of dread.",t3_e1nbtq
f8suf7j,t1_f8qmfvq,I thought you were purposely retelling the story. It still works.,t3_e1nbtq
f8u7kpu,t1_f8qmfvq,Your story should definitely exist. It was great.,t3_e1nbtq
f8qmigt,t1_f8qmfvq,"Well it's a lot famous than it used to be, but most people don't know it",t3_e1nbtq
f8r54m1,t1_f8r47lf,"Yes!  Anastasia, that was it.  I've honestly not seen the film in almost 20 years.  (I think the last time I saw Cinderella was in Japanese class in high school -- it was on Laser Disc and dubbed.  And if you think those mice are annoying singing in English, they're way worse in Japanese, lemme tell you.)  


When I hear the name Anastasia, I think more the Russian princess (though not necessarily the animated film about her with the bat).    


I liked Tangled as well, though it really disturbed me at times (very classic Disney in that sense), especially the 'Mother Knows Best' song.  Yikes.  But the last animated film I saw based on old myths and fairy tales was ""Song of the Sea"" (not fairy tales in the same sense as Cinderella, but selkies are fairies, so it's a fairy tale of a sort).",t3_e1nbtq
f8u7oz3,t1_f8ritgm,"""Lovely sense of dread"" is a perfect description.",t3_e1nbtq
f8ue2z9,t1_f8u7kpu,"Aww, thanks Alice :)",t3_e1nbtq
f8qmjcf,t1_f8qmigt,I'm just a nerd,t3_e1nbtq
f8senlv,t1_f8r54m1,"I guess now that Fox is owned by Disney, people have been asking if the animated Anastasia (produced by Fox's short-lived animation branch) will be inducted as a proper Disney Princess TM",t3_e1nbtq
