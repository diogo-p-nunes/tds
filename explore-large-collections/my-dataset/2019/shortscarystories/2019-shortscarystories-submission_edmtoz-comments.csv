fbj6f0y,t3_edmtoz,"This week alone, there's three scary story involving TV. You guys trying to tell us something?

TV aside, I like this story. The TV showing different people being tortured in hell is a really cool idea, and how each people are tortured by their phobia is nice too.

I wonder what would happen if the person had a phobia of long words? Would Satan read a dictionary containing long words only?",t3_edmtoz
