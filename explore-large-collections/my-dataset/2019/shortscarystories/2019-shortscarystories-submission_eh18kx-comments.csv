Local 58 aside, the ending was a bit too predictable, though it's straightforward that it's not really a twist. Aside from that, cool story. Usually in stories like this, the people can atleast use another source of light, but nope, the goddamn light is gone. Wonder if a blind person would be effected by all the light going out. Good one.",t3_eh18kx
