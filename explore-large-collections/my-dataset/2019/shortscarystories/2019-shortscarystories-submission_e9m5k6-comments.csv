fajpi0v,t3_e9m5k6,"I really like the idea of the story. The overall plot is good, the vocabulary too. But the way you separated the paragraphs made the impact lighter. You can try to make the story build up more, let the suspense roll and grow then make everything hit the reader in the face with the last few words. I love this kind of feeling when I read.

The way Jeff spoke also needed improvement, it was a little off.

This is just my opinion, and I'm not that great of a writer so take it into consideration but don't mind it too much, okay? üòÅ",t3_e9m5k6

When I start writing a story, I can‚Äôt help thinking it through to the end and foreshadowing plot points for the novel that never is released, or the sequel that never happens. It really throws off my flow in the short story format.

Here‚Äôs what happened in my brain on this story.

We know that Subject 19 is a clone of Jeff. We know that there are defects in the cloning process that they are working on.

After Subject 19 is incinerated, Jeff gets worried that he‚Äôll have to call ‚ÄúJennifer‚Äù.

We know that their work is highly controversial.

Jeff awakens Subject 20, who has another physical defect, but is smart enough to run the lab.

Jeff is busy on the outside keeping the controversial work a secret. Eventually he gets shot by a radical protestor.  

Jennifer comes into the scene and awakens Subject 114, the replacement for Jeff. Yes, Jeff is a clone also, Subject 113.

The story unfolds to reveal that Jeff (Subject 113) is a clone of Jennifer‚Äôs husband as are all of the clones. The defects seem to be inversely related. i.e. nearly perfect physically with low mental capacity or flawed physically with genius mental capacity. That‚Äôs why the lower numbered subjects are working in the lab out of public eye and the 100 series subjects are the public face of the company. Still have the 200 and 300 series for further twists. The ‚Äúare they even human‚Äù line sets up for some weird genetic twists in the 400 series.

What happened to the original Jeff? While married to Jennifer he convinced her to allow him to be the face of the new technology and company. ‚ÄúScience is misogynistic, having a man‚Äôs face will bring more investors.‚Äù He would tell her. With the fame and fortune, and now his name on the company he gets much worse (cheating, abusive, etc.)

She can‚Äôt divorce him, so she comes to the realization that he is ‚Äúunviable.‚Äù She takes his genetic material for the cloning, murders him and feeds him to the incinerator. A cool side plot here would be when she realizes that she can make clones of him with things that were lacking in the relationship. Physical, emotional or mental tweaks could spin out for comic relief or character depth.

Now you have an open story with categorizations all set up in my brain. It happens most times I start to write on any subject and very quickly.

Getting a short story out of that while not trying to set up the rest of the plot seems to be my struggle.

Tips and/or a class to assist me would be greatly appreciated. It‚Äôs only a hobby for me, so I don‚Äôt know how much time and/or resources I will continue to have for it.

Oh.. title for the sequel to the novel that will never be? CRISPR(ier) Unviables‚Ä¶ obviously!",t3_e9m5k6

fajpupt,t1_fajpi0v,"Thank you! That's what I've been struggling with the most. I tend to be very wordy when writing. I recently picked it up as a hobby, focusing on the short stories to help work on being more concise. The first draft was 700 words on this one. Getting the same flow with the build up to suspense, then release with less filler seems unnatural to my style. Any tips that you have are greatly appreciated. It feels that when I just put the main foreshadowed ideas in less words that it's too obvious. i.e. the reader will not be as shocked at the conclusion. If you or someone else would like to re-write it in a more concise manner and post or send it to me that would probably help my journey a lot. Glad you enjoyed it and thank you again for the feedback!",t3_e9m5k6
fbuv2ib,t1_fak2lwb,"I cant really help you out here, but all i can say is that you are a wonderful writer! Please keep writing!",t3_e9m5k6
fbuvov6,t1_fbuv2ib,"Thank you! I plan on it! 

I think I'm getting better at it. I just needed to draw out a plot line then ditch any of the unimportant foreshadowed events that I was reserving for later. I started a larger work on the side that I'm working them into for a possible Novella, so maybe it's my outlet for the more advance plots. I appreciate the encouragement and feedback!!",t3_e9m5k6
