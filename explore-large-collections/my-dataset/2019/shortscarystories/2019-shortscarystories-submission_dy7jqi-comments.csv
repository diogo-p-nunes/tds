f7znisn,t3_dy7jqi,I didn't think it was predictable in the least. I thought it was shocking  and scary and horrible(in a good way) and wonderful! Thank you for sharing!,t3_dy7jqi
f7zw5et,t3_dy7jqi,"I honestly did not see that plot twist coming at the end at all. This was so good and so well written, too. Bravo! (Brava?)",t3_dy7jqi
f7zxjf8,t3_dy7jqi,This was good. So good. I didn’t suspect the twist at all. The last line is really eerie,t3_dy7jqi
f7zmbxv,t3_dy7jqi,Damn. Conjoined twins?,t3_dy7jqi
f7zc6ad,t3_dy7jqi,"Although it was predictable, it was a good story",t3_dy7jqi
f80buuz,t3_dy7jqi,"Honestly they could've at least decapitated her, that can't be healthy",t3_dy7jqi
f8025ao,t3_dy7jqi,"Bruh, I didn’t expect that end, conjoined twins",t3_dy7jqi
f80j8nw,t3_dy7jqi,I really like how you dropped hints that are only really apparent after rereading,t3_dy7jqi
f80whwn,t3_dy7jqi,"Sometimes this is back to back with r/offmychest and tonight it fooled me. I read the first sentence in passing, then scrolled right back up and read it again lol, nicely done OP 🎀",t3_dy7jqi
f80ismc,t3_dy7jqi,"The twist was painfully obvious. Your language use wasn't subtle enough to make it surprising.   


Also if he asked something 'shockingly', it means what he said was unexpected and startling. If he's surprised by something, he asks, 'shocked'.",t3_dy7jqi
f80aa0b,t3_dy7jqi,Loved it! Did not see the conjoined part coming.,t3_dy7jqi
f80eur8,t3_dy7jqi,"Reminds me of a reverse Basket Case, I love it!",t3_dy7jqi
f80ix4s,t3_dy7jqi,...was not expecting that ending but I love when they end with twists like that. good story!,t3_dy7jqi
f80n6n0,t3_dy7jqi,Well done 👏👏👏,t3_dy7jqi
f80nc8b,t3_dy7jqi,I don't get where the 10 years of listening to her nag comes in if they're conjoined twins.,t3_dy7jqi
f80oobn,t3_dy7jqi,Great story with a wonderful twist. Took me totally by surprise. Thank you!,t3_dy7jqi
f80pc2l,t3_dy7jqi,I need more. This is amazing. Great work!,t3_dy7jqi
f812oum,t3_dy7jqi,Such a great story and amazing twist!,t3_dy7jqi
f8131g5,t3_dy7jqi,"I found this genuinely unsettling, good job!",t3_dy7jqi
f81l5jc,t3_dy7jqi,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, OK, but whoa!!!",t3_dy7jqi
f81o2w8,t3_dy7jqi,Great story! Did not expect that twist at all:D,t3_dy7jqi
f83rmdm,t3_dy7jqi,"Fantastic story, did not see that coming",t3_dy7jqi
f8q71an,t3_dy7jqi,i just want to know if someone can kill their conjoined twin and survive,t3_dy7jqi
f80l8in,t3_dy7jqi,Was  not expecting that ending. This plot twist at the end was amazing!!,t3_dy7jqi
f9fpi0a,t3_dy7jqi,Predictable yet horrifying,t3_dy7jqi
fg0wyy9,t3_dy7jqi,">But when someone is stuck to you for so long you start to resent them.

That's when I knew they were conjoined, and

>Shelly was the attractive twin

that's the thing confirmed it for me. Maybe change it to where the emphasis is on the fact that they are sisters and not so inseparable?",t3_dy7jqi
f7zo15k,t1_f7znisn,"Wow, thank you for that. Really glad you liked it.",t3_dy7jqi
f7zmfe6,t1_f7zmbxv,Lol ya conjoined twins,t3_dy7jqi
f7zph7w,t1_f7zc6ad,"I think the line ""it's your fault we never had any friends"" tipped me off to the plot twist. 

That being said, it's a great story.",t3_dy7jqi
f7zcw9f,t1_f7zc6ad,I'll take that lol Thanks I appreciate it.,t3_dy7jqi
f80qvdn,t1_f80buuz,"Yeah, no way gangrene doesn't kill the remaining twin.",t3_dy7jqi
f8025zx,t1_f8025ao,## bruh 👌👌😤😤😫,t3_dy7jqi
f810bsx,t1_f80nc8b,Same. They didn’t come across as 10 year olds.,t3_dy7jqi
f81jd0q,t1_f80nc8b,That's a mistake on my part. I was trying to show that one time they were close and all the years of nagging drove them apart. I could have written it better sorry.,t3_dy7jqi
f7zvzyz,t1_f7zo15k,Reminds me of BZRK is that where you got your inspiration?,t3_dy7jqi
f80ayjj,t1_f7zo15k,Loved the story,t3_dy7jqi
f80p4fk,t1_f7zmfe6,"Such excellent physical horror in this one! I legitimately felt sick at the thought of killing a person who is straight up a part of myself then having to live with the rotting remains of that person *still fucking attached*.

Now I'm stuck actually wondering if it would rot? Like the brain could ""die"" (i.e. conciseness leaving it) but the flesh is still a part of your body so it might live, constantly stuck in the expression of horror and betrayal that they had in their last moments. Now I'm double sick.",t3_dy7jqi
f7zmllt,t1_f7zmfe6,Yikes.,t3_dy7jqi
f80x7rg,t1_f7zph7w,"The ""when someone is stuck to you for so long"" line is what tipped me off.""",t3_dy7jqi
f82obbg,t1_f7zph7w,"This is the one that got me and then it all started coming together.

>but one thing I had going for me was my fantastic figure and it drove Shelly mad that I was in control of it.",t3_dy7jqi
f8129we,t1_f7zph7w,I was thinking they were dating and then the twin part came. I'm too stupid to put things together.,t3_dy7jqi
f80aykt,t1_f7zcw9f,"i think the line ""I was starting to worry what effect this would have on me."" gives away an otherwise unique story. perhaps something like ""my concern grew as I realized the circumstance I was in"" would be more vague and alluring",t3_dy7jqi
f81ne59,t1_f81jd0q,"Yeah, with limited space it's not easy to decide what to put in our leave out.",t3_dy7jqi
f7zwfnh,t1_f7zvzyz,BZRK? This was from a two-sentence horror I posted about a year ago,t3_dy7jqi
f80cfkr,t1_f80ayjj,Thank you Catbird1369. You commented on other stories I had written. So glad to see you sticking around. I mean that.,t3_dy7jqi
f85w013,t1_f80p4fk,"Hope this makes you feel better (???) but when a part of your body dies, it is dead for real and will likely start decomposition and should be removed ASAP. If you're really interested in the cellular mechanisms, look up apoptosis vs necrosis. Apoptosis happens normally like when you shed skin off or when your immune system kills an infected cell and it usually won't harm surrounding tissue. Necrosis usually happens ""by accident"" like when your conjoined twin bashes your brain in. The cells that are broken open by the trauma can poison surrounding cells, and then maybe you get an infection TOO, maybe you get gangrene, so the whole thing has to go. Even if the dead head wasn't decomposing, it wouldn't be kept alive by the blood supply of the main twin because the brain tissue is just not salvageable at all after massive trauma like that. 

Really the unrealistic part of the story is :
A) if the ""head only"" twin is killed, our main character might suffer blood loss and die
B) if the twin is decomposing, the main character might die of infection too
C) separation operations usually could be done in cases where the surgeons say it'll be too risky, if it was ethical to sacrifice one twin so that the other could be kept intact
D) if the separation operation in OP's case was actually too risky, then having the risk of infection would make it an emergency and might justify the risk of trying the surgery anyway for that 20% chance of survival or whatever it would be.
So rest assured that this probably wouldn't happen in real life.

Anyway if OP is reading this, it was horrible and made me feel ill, loved it and upvoted it, please keep writing! The twist ending was hinted at so well in the beginning, I had to go back and read for all the grotesque hints at the real situation. It felt original in all the worst ways, keep the good work up.",t3_dy7jqi
f8119y7,t1_f80x7rg,Ditto.,t3_dy7jqi
f7zwn6h,t1_f7zwfnh,BZRK is a book which is also about conjoined twins SPOILER AHEAD!!! one of them turns insane and almost kills his brother that is why I expected this ending,t3_dy7jqi
f80cvh1,t1_f80cfkr,You’re welcome you’re really good I love your stories. And thank you,t3_dy7jqi
f860kdi,t1_f85w013,Thanks. I'm still equally horrified but I appreciate the information,t3_dy7jqi
f86dl0r,t1_f85w013,"Thank you and everything you pointed out is fair and realistically probably what would happen in this case. I like it when I learn something from a comment so have my upvote, my friend.",t3_dy7jqi
f7zxfjr,t1_f7zwn6h,"Sounds like something I would like to read. To me, it's an interesting concept. I would love to know if there were any cases like this in history",t3_dy7jqi
f7zz43e,t1_f7zxfjr,Well BZRK is a fantasy book about nanobots who can rewire someones brain and stuff really cool. You should definitely read it if you are interested,t3_dy7jqi
f811y16,t1_f7zz43e,"YESSSS, Michael Grant gang unite",t3_dy7jqi
f7zzf9q,t1_f7zz43e,Thanks for the heads up,t3_dy7jqi
