fc008l8,t3_efebth,"I'd cry too if the only present that I got was a picture of my relatives.

Ungrateful u/aqeem aside, I like the story. Since this story is released on Christmas, you can perceive it as the Elves that the SSS Santa probably kidnap, since he's either a demon or a psycho. Very spooky since there's something mysterious about the entire story, and how we don't know if the ""trapped in hell"" was a figure of speech or a literal definition of the predicament that they're in. Good one, keep on writing!",t3_efebth
fbzzibf,t3_efebth,Good read,t3_efebth
fc1fhcp,t3_efebth,"Loved the reveal at the end, the little hints to something sinister like the camera on the tree were excellent!",t3_efebth
fc1v4ci,t3_efebth,"Hmm any theories? It doesn't make sense as to why little boys would be in Hell so I'm assuming that's not literally where they are. 

Maybe they're children abandoned at an orphanage/institution by their families?",t3_efebth
fc9rqp0,t3_efebth,Duolingo warned them to practice their French lessons!,t3_efebth
fc1bjmu,t1_fc008l8,"I genuinely look forward to seeing your comments. Will you be writing anything in the future? You have a, very descriptive, way with words.",t3_efebth
fc1v7v6,t1_fc1v4ci,All I'll say about it is that they're not literally in hell.,t3_efebth
fc1c9c8,t1_fc1bjmu,"No sir, my writing skills is absolutely horrendous! Atleast that's what my mom, an english lecturer, said about it haha. In a way, I've lot of ideas, but I don't know how to write them well. Creating suspense is really one of my weakness, since most of my writings is littered with words that help reach the minimum word count!",t3_efebth
fc1cirb,t1_fc1c9c8,I respectfully disagree with her. I like reading your comments they're always amusing.,t3_efebth
fc1crwa,t1_fc1cirb,"Thank you! Who knows, maybe I'll write an SSS later! I do have an idea, but I need to learn how to correctly use past/present/future tense, and how to create an unsettling and mysterious atmosphere to my story :P",t3_efebth
fc23geh,t1_fc1crwa,What is sss? I'm curious to know since I keep seeing it every where,t3_efebth
fc23jar,t1_fc23geh,"The subreddit name, short formed. Short Scary Stories!",t3_efebth
