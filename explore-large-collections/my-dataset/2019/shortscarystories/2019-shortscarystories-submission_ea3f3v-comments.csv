fania2e,t3_ea3f3v,That's actually not a bad place to be in. You get to live in a vast universe where every story is tied together book by book. You could pretty much fit in and make a life somewhere because the places are developed so much in history. Just remember that there's more good than bad people. Someone will protect you.,t3_ea3f3v

fankme2,t1_fanjyo1,"This would still mean you know you were reborn into a world where Hogwarts exists. If you are just a muggle who knows this stuff from the books and movies you wouldn't go and blow up the trainstation. With the terror awareness in UK that would be a stupid thing to do.

But let's assume you are reborn with the knowledge that the magic world exists and you know there is an entry point on Kingscross Station. I think there are still safeguards in place to keep you out. And if you get there? It's just a matter of time until someone notices your lack of magic ability, then the ministry snatches you and wipes your memory.",t3_ea3f3v
fb7j3x6,t1_fb7eyot,"awesome, thank you!

edit: just read it, and it was very good... short, sweet, and to the point (lousy spin, btw). I have no idea why they would've taken it down; I can't see any reason for copyright violation and there's nothing else that seems unacceptable... weird",t3_ea3f3v

fanl2h2,t1_fankme2,"And again you underestimate the determination of a human.
First off, its painfully easily to pick wizards out of a crowd with muggles.
They don't dress normal and they act weird. You could choose the station that all the children board the train to hogwards and place a bomb on the muggle side of it. Making sure that every wizard on that train station is a hostage.
Second, no matter how good of a wizard you are, they all die to a bullet.
You can take their money and enter diagon alley by pretending to be a wizard and slipping in when someone else enters (or pretend to forgot the code but show a wand to identify yourself as a wizard) there are a lot of items that require no afinity to magic you can buy (or steal) and use them to work your way around spells. Take a few hostages and blackmail some people with future knowledge and fuck up cannon.",t3_ea3f3v

fanl980,t1_fanl4o9,The spider form was a female. Pennywise form is a male and the deadlights (the real true form is genderless.,t3_ea3f3v
fano4t0,t1_fanl2h2,">They don't dress normal and they act weird.

Have you been out there? People dress crazy and act weird all the time. Also it seems that the magic on places like Kings Cross, the ministry or the leaking cauldron has the ability to avert the attention of humans. Maybe that works to a certain degree on the wizards and witches themselves, too.

And to your radical ideas like taking hostages or placing bombs. These things are no match to magic. There is wandless and unspoken magic. The could do thing before you even realize it. They can appear and disappear in the blink of a moment and take you out without any harm to your victims. And stuff like a dead man trigger wouldn't work either. Cast a shield around the bomb or transfigure the bomb itself.

If you are reborn with a certain extend of magical abilities, then you'd have better chances. If you then get hand on a wand, you could use it to call the Knight bus to get you to Diagon Alley. There you could spend time in the bookstores to actually learn some magic. Maybe even find a teacher.",t3_ea3f3v
fbao079,t1_fbamv9r,"well, that sucks. very un-validating, too. like it's not worth their time to even give you a reason. the mod gods taketh away a lot more than they giveth sometimes",t3_ea3f3v
fanlcd7,t1_fanl980,I would date the spider...,t3_ea3f3v
fanrj1j,t1_fano4t0,"Wizards are kinda easy to fool, most of them are lazy and are too used to the fact that they can conjure up almost anything.
Most people in the wizard world don't even know basic attack/defense spells. Ofcourse you have the Augurs however the biggest blindspot of the Wizarding World is that they have 0% idea about muggle strategies and weapons.
Not a single wizard would even know what a human bomb would look like. Also, I assume that you would work from anonimity instead of showing up in person.
Use cellhphones and they will be unable to track you.",t3_ea3f3v

faolhch,t1_faod0d8,That's what I'm trying to say,t3_ea3f3v
faolnwa,t1_faohzvd,Because they carry around their owls all the time? Most wizards are only traveling inside the magic community and don't even get close to muggels. And those who do certainly prepare at least a little bit. After all there's full part of the ministry dedicated to keep the wizard world secret.,t3_ea3f3v

faolxp4,t1_faohumm,Depends on what your cause is. A thing I'd totally get behind is to expose the wizard world so they have to share their magic with the muggels. Imagine all the thing that could be done. And those egoistic wizards keep them all to themselves.,t3_ea3f3v
