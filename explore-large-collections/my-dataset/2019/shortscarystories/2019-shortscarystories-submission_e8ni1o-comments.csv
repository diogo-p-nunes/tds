fadg8np,t3_e8ni1o,I love this. These short stories rarely strike me but something about this one made me want to read soooo much more about ms. Nelly and little Sarah,t3_e8ni1o
fadjvip,t3_e8ni1o,Interesting. Years ago there was this story about this kid who got someone/people (can‚Äôt remember) jailed because he claimed they killed him in a previous life. The kicker was that they found the body. Maybe Sarah should do the same.,t3_e8ni1o
fadx1k6,t3_e8ni1o,"If they are staring at each other, how is Ms Nelly not looking her in the eye?",t3_e8ni1o
fag1uxm,t3_e8ni1o,"Last sentence is a little jarring. Would you say ""I know what you're hiding at 34 Becker St *and under the shed*,"" or something more like ""I know what you're hiding under the shed at 34 Becker St""?",t3_e8ni1o
faddnoc,t3_e8ni1o,So good,t3_e8ni1o
fadh7xe,t3_e8ni1o,This is one of my all-time favorites on the sub. Bravo!,t3_e8ni1o
fafzdxi,t3_e8ni1o,"You‚Äôre an excellent short story writer. One small bit of constructive criticism: the ending could have been less explicit. Something like, ‚ÄúBecause little miss know it all knew everything, including what Ms Nelly hid in the shed.‚Äù",t3_e8ni1o
fadjf49,t3_e8ni1o,Wow. Just... wow. This is a short but amazing read.,t3_e8ni1o
fb322b1,t3_e8ni1o,"i like it but this sentence confused me :
""Ms Nelly had helped him bury the body that soon floated atop the calm waters of the lake near the Osborne‚Äôs home."" 
after they buried the body... it was floating in the lake?? but now it's in the shed? (might be something else in the shed though)",t3_e8ni1o
fadfxse,t3_e8ni1o,Nice!,t3_e8ni1o
fae5yhj,t3_e8ni1o,"Nice this has great rhythm, definitely a poem",t3_e8ni1o
faerjzw,t3_e8ni1o,Great tale OP. I would love to know more about Sarah.,t3_e8ni1o
faebmq4,t3_e8ni1o,"Well done, Ms. Nelly! You‚Äôve antagonized the one person who can truly screw you over. I wish Sarah didn‚Äôt let her know that /she/ knew, however. T.T",t3_e8ni1o
fadpxu5,t3_e8ni1o,Oooooo @bocadeloup! Can I narrate this?! I'll link it back here! Its so good!,t3_e8ni1o
fadrmb3,t3_e8ni1o,That was really good. üëè,t3_e8ni1o
fadztgv,t3_e8ni1o,Such a great little read. Nice job!,t3_e8ni1o
fae4daq,t3_e8ni1o,"That was such a good read, gave me goosebumps!",t3_e8ni1o
faegoew,t3_e8ni1o,"I really like the way this ended, and the prose are well written. Good one :)",t3_e8ni1o
faehria,t3_e8ni1o,"What a fantastic short story, loved it!",t3_e8ni1o
faelgux,t3_e8ni1o,I'm scared that this sounds almost exactly like meeeee,t3_e8ni1o
faenzq2,t3_e8ni1o,Wow this is goooood!,t3_e8ni1o
faetbs1,t3_e8ni1o,This could be a twilight zone episode! Love it!,t3_e8ni1o

fb8wg76,t3_e8ni1o,Shivers. Thank you x,t3_e8ni1o
fbx4jz9,t3_e8ni1o,"This is Amazing and I would love to illustrate this, I'm super inspired aaaaaaaaa
.
Do you mind if I illustrate this story as a comic, I'll credit you obviously",t3_e8ni1o
fd0nd9b,t3_e8ni1o,I want more,t3_e8ni1o
fdzr5xo,t3_e8ni1o,"The paragraph of ""especially Miss Nelly"" contradicts the one directly below. Is she staring or can she not look in her eyes?",t3_e8ni1o
fhsf45u,t3_e8ni1o,My favourite story and one I wanted to keep going! Well done,t3_e8ni1o
fi2tvq8,t3_e8ni1o,I don‚Äôt get it,t3_e8ni1o
fn5f29b,t3_e8ni1o,This reminds me of an actual news article where a mother drowned a kid.,t3_e8ni1o
fr1w9hg,t3_e8ni1o,"Did the son kill Sarah, or did the son just find Sarah?",t3_e8ni1o
frvyjqy,t3_e8ni1o,I guess Sarah _does_ recognize the bodies in the water.,t3_e8ni1o
fadsgqp,t3_e8ni1o,Damn fine writing!  Thanks for sharing.....would b a great movie!!!,t3_e8ni1o

faf8suo,t3_e8ni1o,"Last sentence is missing an ""it's"" I believe but otherwise it's good.",t3_e8ni1o
fadgw2e,t1_fadg8np,"Thank you, that is so nice to hear. I might write more when I am inspired :)!",t3_e8ni1o
fadl20p,t1_fadjvip,"That would suck, imagine getting jailed for a crime a past self committed....",t3_e8ni1o
fkiqrqj,t1_fadjvip,Aight this comment is old as fuck but I need some answers man. Are you talking a real news story cause that's breaking news and I haven't heard about that ever,t3_e8ni1o

fby8oli,t1_fbx4jz9,"That would be lovely! Thank you. Sure thing, send me a link/copy when you do it :)!",t3_e8ni1o
fag1jxp,t1_faf7x30,The mystery is the best part. Not every story needs every detail written all the way out,t3_e8ni1o
faf965w,t1_fadgw2e,I would also love to read more!,t3_e8ni1o
fafux1p,t1_fadgw2e,Please do!,t3_e8ni1o
fazyybb,t1_fadgw2e,This was dam good i would read more,t3_e8ni1o
faduroz,t1_fadl20p,Now im just imagining someone waiting to arrest a baby the day its born cause they think its Jeffery Dahmer being reincarnated,t3_e8ni1o
fadlhdo,t1_fadl20p,"Other way around. But yes, that would suck too.
Just understood. Both would be bad.",t3_e8ni1o
faen30z,t1_faejzet,Oooooohhhh,t3_e8ni1o
fajd78n,t1_fag90eb,Actually I like how it ends lol I wouldn‚Äôt change it,t3_e8ni1o

fb6bmkm,t1_favbmja,"You are so kind! I wouldn't even know where to begin with podcasting, that's why I prefer reading out loud, :)",t3_e8ni1o
