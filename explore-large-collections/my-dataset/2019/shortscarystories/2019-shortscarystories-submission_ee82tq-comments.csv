fbr5z6o,t3_ee82tq,"If I work here, I'll just give someone 40% for him/her to ask me where Allen is everytime I clock in. Free moneyz  yo.

Allen aside, stories with rules in them is one of my personal favourite. I like this one, as there's no explanation on what kind of job this is, or what is happening at all. Fun one, but I've a question that's confusing me. Where's Allen?",t3_ee82tq

fbtwnys,t1_fbtfoqo,Perhaps every ‘employee’ is actually being held hostage and Allen is someone in the past who tried to escape and found out some stuff so they killed him and made everyone else forget and every time someone mentions Allen it’s because they start to remember and whoever is holding them hostage makes them forget again,t3_ee82tq
