fblv4sg,t3_edwm0v,"Killer Queen has already touched the suicide vest.

Jojo aside, my god, this story is the bomb! I can't explain the mindblowing that I got from that plot twist.

Puns aside, that is really how I felt. I like the way this story is written, such as the details about the sea of people in there, making the situation more intense. Good story!",t3_edwm0v
fbltgsg,t3_edwm0v,Damn,t3_edwm0v
fbn371m,t3_edwm0v,You really know how to put the reader right into the story. I gasped at the last line.  Jameson now knows that Karma is a bitch.,t3_edwm0v
fbufhsx,t3_edwm0v,"EOD arriving anywhere in 13 minutes is the real story here.

Or maybe that's just for the military.",t3_edwm0v

fbufwfi,t1_fbufjj2,"It's not uncommon in the Army to wait several hours for EOD to arrive.  Not sure about police force EOD techs, though.",t3_edwm0v
fbw2nog,t1_fbw0y2m,Rightous!,t3_edwm0v
fbufzkx,t1_fbufwfi,"Ah, I figured police in central NYC would likely have these kinds of units on constant standby.",t3_edwm0v
fbug6nq,t1_fbufzkx,"Like I said, I wouldn't know about police forces.  Perhaps you're right for some place like Grand Central.  It doesn't detract from the story either way.  I liked it.",t3_edwm0v
fbugb00,t1_fbug6nq,You seem to know a few things about armed forces. Would love to know what you think of my Lazarus series (military zombie apocalyse).,t3_edwm0v
fbuh2vr,t1_fbugb00,I served in the Army for 5 years.  Hook me up with a link and I'll look them over.  Always happy to read some new material.,t3_edwm0v
