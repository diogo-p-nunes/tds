fbwn199,t3_eets7q,"Wow, nowadays, not only friend can stab your back and steal your crush, but your other personality can do so too. 

Crush stealing aside, good story. The description of the fight is nice, though the plot twist is a little bit predictable, especially with the hints scattered on the first part of the story. The story is scary, though I don't know if someone with DID can get incredibly hostile with their other personality. Nice one.",t3_eets7q

Thanks for the feedback! I dont think someone with DID can go after their other personality either, but I figured itd be quite creepy if that actually happened!",t3_eets7q
