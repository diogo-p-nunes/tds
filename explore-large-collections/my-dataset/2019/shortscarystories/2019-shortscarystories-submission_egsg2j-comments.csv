fca5m0i,t3_egsg2j,"Good story! I would've loved to know who or what Nona actually was, but I understand that its a short story and we can't fit everything we want. The descriptions were well made and they made me picture the scene in my head, which was not pleasant but I guess that's your objective, I hope you keep writing!",t3_egsg2j

fch7619,t1_fcax54v,The narrator is trapped in a pit with some kind of dragon or other monster. The monster is a little crazy/senile and treating the narrator like one of her own babies.,t3_egsg2j
fch6gne,t1_fccv8og,I was also picturing a dragon,t3_egsg2j
