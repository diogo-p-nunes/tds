fb3rh8n,t3_eb8x3e,I uh... Can somebody explain it?,t3_eb8x3e
fb4tez8,t1_fb3rh8n,"The narrator is in an asylum for murdering someone who wanted to get them the mental help they needed, and because they won't take their meds, the delusions are getting worse.",t3_eb8x3e
fb4wuji,t1_fb4tez8,Nailed it! Thanks for explaining. I was just about to but was hoping someone else would. Wanted to make sure it made sense haha,t3_eb8x3e
fb4tgpm,t1_fb4tez8,Thank you,t3_eb8x3e
fb63ox6,t1_fb4wuji,"I made a post on here with a quick idea. I’m not a writer by any means, but I didn’t get the point across as well as I should have. It made it seem too political when I reread it later. It was supposed to be a “destroying more than what’s needed because you’re not being agreed with” kind of irony. I think you made your point way easier to get, I didn’t have trouble with it at all. I wish I had that sort of sense in my writing.",t3_eb8x3e
fb6894e,t1_fb63ox6,Thank you for the read and comment. I just read your story and found it easy to understand. I did see how it could be considered political but I felt you could change some names and put it in any recent time period or in the future. If that makes sense. I did like the story and was not expecting the ending. It was an enjoyable read.,t3_eb8x3e
fb694os,t1_fb6894e,Thanks. Putting it in the future is a good idea. I might try that.,t3_eb8x3e
fb6dvbx,t1_fb694os,No worries. I wasn't suggesting changing anything with your story. I just meant it felt very universal. If you do try it I am interested in seeing the results. Good luck!,t3_eb8x3e
