fcgjggr,t3_eh41g7,It kind of reads backwards too. I like it.,t3_eh41g7
fcdtrp8,t3_eh41g7,"Nope, I have no joke. Damn it was supposed to be so easy to find a joke in every post here.

Hidden unfunny joke aside, very creepy. I've read about stories that tells the idea of people still being able to think and feel after they're dead, but rarely does anyone combine it with suicide. The feeling of despair and hopelessness hearing the one that you care about screaming and crying over your suicide would be pretty terrifying and heartbreaking. Good one.",t3_eh41g7
fciq224,t3_eh41g7,"Hey guys! Just wanted to remind everyone that suicide is never the answer. Shit might feel really bad right now but reach out and things will get better. I have been in bad places before but with support I find my way out and I am so glad. If you don’t have someone close to you that you can talk to have a look online, there are lots of great free resources and chat or txt services available. Love to you all x",t3_eh41g7
fcgbyd5,t3_eh41g7,"Good one scary, sad and terrifying at the same time.",t3_eh41g7
fcgvnut,t3_eh41g7,This felt unsettlingly personal...,t3_eh41g7
fcgqsv4,t3_eh41g7,"Damn dude, this is poetry",t3_eh41g7
fcggywj,t3_eh41g7,We all know that it's never easy. We all know why.,t3_eh41g7
fcguzcl,t3_eh41g7,"really good, like the style u formatted it in too!",t3_eh41g7
fcio7ox,t3_eh41g7,"As someone who has attempted suicide, this one hit me hard. Though for me, it didn't really scare me as much as make me cry. I'm so thankful I'm still here. Though this is very jarring. Great job.",t3_eh41g7
fch2zxh,t3_eh41g7,"Woah, this is just, damn. This is really good.",t3_eh41g7

fdhirdw,t3_eh41g7,Holy shit. I thought she was killing her mother and her mother was screaming,t3_eh41g7
fch1fpa,t3_eh41g7,"The title makes me ponder, ngl 

Very sad and interesting otherwise",t3_eh41g7
fck8pba,t3_eh41g7,It’s really hard for one to bleed to death by cutting their wrist. So that’s the rough way out.,t3_eh41g7
fcgpbv3,t1_fcgjggr,Woah I kind of like it better backwards.,t3_eh41g7
fcgbl0l,t1_fcdtrp8,Yeah that would be horrible,t3_eh41g7
fcgipia,t1_fcdtrp8,"I really felt this one, it really displayed a harsh picture in my head. Almost felt like there was emotion behind this piece of writing.  


It was decent though I will admit. Good job OP! :D",t3_eh41g7
fcjciui,t1_fciidae,"Me too. Honestly the only reason I'm still here is because I'm terrified death could be even worse. I mean, what if there is a God and a Hell other than the one on earth? If God would allow you to suffer in life so much that you're made to want to end it, who's to say he wouldn't punish you if you did end it? I honestly envy atheists that are so firm in their belief that God isn't real and that there's no afterlife. They don't have that fear. Me, I'm cursed with being an agnostic who knows that no one can know for sure what is and what isn't there until we actually die. People say you shouldn't be afraid of the inevitable (as in death) since there's nothing you can do about it, but that's what makes it so horrifying to me, knowing there's absolutely nothing you can do. Once you're dead, there's nothing you can do, and there's no way of knowing if it will be better, worse, or just nothing. Helplessness and the unknown is utterly terrifying.",t3_eh41g7
fcj67i2,t1_fciidae,Happy to chat if you want to private message me.,t3_eh41g7
fcizvcy,t1_fciidae,Are you ok right now? Do you want to talk about anything?,t3_eh41g7
fcgphhc,t1_fcgpbv3,I thought that was intentional honestly. It keeps more mystery backwards.,t3_eh41g7
fcjon4p,t1_fcjciui,"yes you hit the nail on the head
I'm too afraid of the unknown 
but recently, the unknown hasn't been scaring me too much.",t3_eh41g7
fcjoosg,t1_fcj67i2,Thank you so much but I'll be alright....,t3_eh41g7
fcjopcr,t1_fcizvcy,"I'll be alright, thank you...",t3_eh41g7
