Boneless human aside, I like it. The plot of a dystopian future, where the goverment is in total control of everything, has been done a lot but it still terrifies me if one day, this kind of thing happens. Good one, captures the feeling of hopelessness as we realized the captured one will not die, their organ will be replaced to prolong their suffering. Cool story.",t3_ee9qf6
fbtjv7x,t3_ee9qf6,"Ooh! This one was good! Haven’t heard anything like this in a l o n g time. Greatly written!

This reminds me of a song. “Perfect Machine”, by Starset. I don’t know if you’ve heard of em, but this story is really similar to their story!",t3_ee9qf6
fbs86rb,t3_ee9qf6,Nice story man!,t3_ee9qf6
fbrxehg,t1_fbrvkrs,"oh that's a great idea, it would've been a good addition if they cannibalized the corpses of the damned.

Anyways, thanks. It's my first story :)",t3_ee9qf6
