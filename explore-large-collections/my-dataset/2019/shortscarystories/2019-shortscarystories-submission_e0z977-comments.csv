f8kjod0,t3_e0z977,"Dude, nice. +1.

Also ""That was the moment the living began to run from the death."" - would be ""the dead"".",t3_e0z977
f8kyo2t,t3_e0z977,I rarely like zombie stories but DAMN you did that well. And I love the use of the fairytale premise. :),t3_e0z977
f8l6sz7,t3_e0z977,I think this is a good piece but could use a bit of refining. You’ve got some grammatical/spelling errors that really take away from the story.,t3_e0z977
f8l8cnn,t3_e0z977,I really liked this. A continuation of a known fairytale that puts an even darker twist. Well done.,t3_e0z977
f8l7yxr,t3_e0z977,My son literally read me that story yesterday! Oh this version gave me the chills.,t3_e0z977

f8s4y7q,t3_e0z977,"From a song

It actually almost became a pop hit 
Its a good song",t3_e0z977

faskw6a,t3_e0z977,"Outstanding combination, very original. I wouldn't have thought this up & I'm clever AF. I especially like the business like manner he keeps after receiving abuse. Like ""Want them back? Sure, here ya go"", 
Great read. The only way to make it better would be if there was more.",t3_e0z977
f8ma3e9,t3_e0z977,A minor point but he didn't drown the children,t3_e0z977
f8luje3,t1_f8kjod0,"damn, I thought that the zombie dead was Death instead of dead. Never can remember which one to use.",t3_e0z977
f8lukfj,t1_f8kyo2t,I plan to do more of those.,t3_e0z977
f8ltb5v,t1_f8l6sz7,"actually I got a refined version on the r/creepypasta subreddit but due to the lenght I made a shortened version.
This story was sadly to short to be a creepypasta and to long to be a shortscary story.

f8lt8mf,t1_f8l7yxr,"haha, fate works in a weird ways",t3_e0z977
f8n5jzd,t1_f8l7yxr,"Is your son a kiddo learning to read aloud? Because if so, kudos to you for keeping the old glories alive! Not many care about the old legends, the grimm, etc.
     
And hell yes I agree this was an amazing version, OP!",t3_e0z977
f8rv6ip,t1_f8n4tob,"Wow, that sounds cool!
Is it from a play?",t3_e0z977
fo1ecl6,t1_f8n5u4w,"Everything has a price. Not just ""magic"".",t3_e0z977
fb71cms,t1_faskw6a,what do you mean with more?,t3_e0z977
f8mg4zh,t1_f8ma3e9,We have no clue what he did with them,t3_e0z977
f8o8ng4,t1_f8ma3e9,"The Wikipedia page on the tale says there are variants on the story, one of which is that he drowned the children as he did the rats.",t3_e0z977

f8n8umc,t1_f8luje3,"Perhaps ""undead"" is what you were shooting for?",t3_e0z977
f8n4ptb,t1_f8lukfj,Oh please do because this was great!,t3_e0z977
f8nwek9,t1_f8n5jzd,Yes he is. The old glories are so much better than the new ones. Or maybe I’m just nostalgic.,t3_e0z977
fo1patn,t1_fo1ecl6,Really? What about say...familial love. Is the price obedience or the pain of losing those we live.,t3_e0z977
fb91kl7,t1_fb71cms,It ended too soon. I would've enjoyed it more had it been longer. This seems strangely familiar.,t3_e0z977
f8mvym8,t1_f8mg4zh,Well the story says he took them into a hill with the implication they actually went and founded a new town,t3_e0z977
f8n4kck,t1_f8mg0z8,"I kind of like the ring of ""the death"". It's not capitalized so it's not the grim reaper.
   
But since the setting isn't in modern times, it reminded me of something similar to a plague that could happen in the middle ages and was just a general term for it. 
    
Also. Who knows! Maybe Pied Piper was an incarnation of **The** ""Death.",t3_e0z977
f8qsqdn,t1_f8nwek9,"Na, you're so right!",t3_e0z977
fbamk3p,t1_fb91kl7,"There's a longer version but it has basically the same plot, just more details",t3_e0z977
