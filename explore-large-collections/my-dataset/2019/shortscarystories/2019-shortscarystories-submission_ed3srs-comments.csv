Cool story.",t3_ed3srs
fbfgipm,t1_fbfgdtk,"Thanks, this definitely wasn't my best work, but I wanted to build on a previous short story in an interesting way, with a 411 twist",t3_ed3srs
fbfh24l,t1_fbfgipm,"Yup, story is definitely interesting, and the twist is really good.

At first you think, ""this is just another person hunting a person."" story.

But it reveals that it is that exact kind of story in the first paragraph, so you think that the police chief daughter will kill the hunter.

But then it turns out that some sort of invisible assassin that can't cover up footprints is the hunter all along.

Goofy description aside, the story is interesting. Keep it up, I'd love to see more stories with twists!",t3_ed3srs
fbfk906,t1_fbfh24l,I took it as the ghosts of the 27 victims were the ones using the knives.,t3_ed3srs
fbfkel7,t1_fbfk906,Ah. That makes much more sense. Thanks for that viewpoint of the story!,t3_ed3srs
