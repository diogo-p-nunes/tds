Binding Of Isaac aside, cool story. I'm terrified of kidnapping, so It's a bit terrifying for me. Even if Isaac brother had deny the hiking man offer, who knows if the man would just kidnap them with force? Spooky.",t3_ebs1ve

fb712p7,t1_fb6y2jd,"Yeah, well. I suppose that's the idea. :P And the sibling (narrator) is actually his sister. Kidnapping by force might have happened, but probably not. I've heard that some kidnappings can even take place in public areas in broad daylight. It's just a matter of luring the kid. Anyway, thank you for reading. :-)",t3_ebs1ve
