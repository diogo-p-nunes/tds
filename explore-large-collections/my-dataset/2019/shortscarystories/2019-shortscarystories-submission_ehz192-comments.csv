fcmh2g5,t3_ehz192,"If you have a doppleganger, the phrase ""go fuck yourself"" can be taken literally!

Literal insult aside, kinda humorous, but at the same time, the thought of facing my own self is very weird and creepy. Who knows if one of us would suddenly have the mindset ""only one of us can exist in this world"". Seeing your own self doing actions that you normally do, smelling yourself, hearing yourself talk not in a recording, would be very surreal, amazing and terrifying. Good one.",t3_ehz192
fcrmk8b,t3_ehz192,"Would we have both the memories of our doppelg√§nger and vice versa. There must be a lot of overlap in that department
Edit: i meant to reply that",t3_ehz192
fcnfj6y,t1_fcmh2g5,You know that whole love yourself thing. I think having a doppelganger would be a great way to figure that out. If you could love yourself. See how other people feel when they interact with you.,t3_ehz192
fcpd0y0,t1_fcnfj6y,"I often wonder how our brains would handle a doppelganger scenario. It's possible that it could be treated in the way that some traumatic experiences are - by distorting their reality to lessen the impact of said trauma, or by amnesia. So our brains may force us to perceive the identical other as a total stranger, perhaps for the sake of preserving our own sanity (seeing a living copy of yourself is a high stress scenario that will probably break you).",t3_ehz192
