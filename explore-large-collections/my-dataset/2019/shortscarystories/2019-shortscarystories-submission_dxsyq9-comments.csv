f7x5ufc,t3_dxsyq9,"As a mom, Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s enough calls in your final line.",t3_dxsyq9
f7xf8t4,t3_dxsyq9,I for sure thought it was Ethan,t3_dxsyq9
f7vs8gn,t3_dxsyq9,"They say write what you know, so I did. This story is loosely based on a series of texts on my phone.

Criticism is welcome and I hope you enjoy!",t3_dxsyq9
f7x7e1e,t3_dxsyq9,Left me wanting more. Good job!,t3_dxsyq9
f7w7pdh,t3_dxsyq9,This reads like what something out of /r/niceguys with a darker element to it. Love the format!,t3_dxsyq9
f7wzsek,t3_dxsyq9,Loved it ... Thanks,t3_dxsyq9
f7xg2gs,t3_dxsyq9,Messages sent and received. These are definitely on the eerie side. Nice job with this one. Love to read more.,t3_dxsyq9
f7xw01h,t3_dxsyq9,I love this story! I def thought it was Ethan but Iâ€™m so happy you went with leaving the identity of the killer unknown.,t3_dxsyq9
f7y6toj,t3_dxsyq9,Simple and good!,t3_dxsyq9
f86elu3,t3_dxsyq9,Spastic! I haven't heard that word being used in years lol Do you mind if I ask where you're from. Great story by the way.,t3_dxsyq9
f7xlhw5,t3_dxsyq9,"(* you are)

Amazing writing btw",t3_dxsyq9
f7x7s6r,t1_f7x5ufc,Yeah I agree but when I wrote higher numbers it felt ridiculous to me haha,t3_dxsyq9
f7xh28c,t1_f7xf8t4,"When I started drafting this response I didn't plan for it to be this long but I actually like it so I'm just gonna keep it as is.

Weirdly enough I don't even know the identity of the villain of this story, just who it isn't. They could be anyone. They could be the normal looking guy who sits behind you in a lecture hall, they could be your TA, they could be the homeless man who stares at you for too long on the train, you just don't know.

I know it isn't Ethan because I liked him better as just an all around solid dude, and also I kinda tried to portray the idea that Ethan has known our narrator for a long time. In addition to this, I'll never name an evil character after one of my real life friends, and Ethan Reiss is a combination of my close friend's first name (Ethan) and Historia Reiss from Attack on Titan who is one of my favorite characters in the show. 

I have in the past named a villain after someone I actively dislike, for example in a sci fi story I have buried in one of my notebooks somewhere I named an antagonist for the girl who cheated on me my freshman year of college. The reason I don't do that much anymore is that it felt very petty. 

Symbolism in names is something that I am not very good at at all so usually if someone is named in one of my stories it's either picked at random, named for a character in another piece of media, named for someone I know in real life, or some combination of these things.",t3_dxsyq9
f7w64eu,t1_f7vs8gn,"Oh shit, are you ok?? This is some scary stuff!",t3_dxsyq9
f7x7m9d,t1_f7x7e1e,"Thanks, this is a wonderful compliment! There is wayy more in my notebook and I really had to fight to make this a coherent narrative with characters that have some level of character in under 500 words, but that's the reason I like this sub so much. Forcing me to choose my words carefully really helps me home the intentionality in my writing",t3_dxsyq9
f7waogp,t1_f7w7pdh,Thanks! I'm considering retrying this format with completely different subject matter at some point to see if it still works,t3_dxsyq9
f7x0xfn,t1_f7wzsek,I'm glad you liked it!,t3_dxsyq9
f7xh98h,t1_f7xg2gs,"I am currently in the process of editing and rewriting stories from my personal notebooks for this sub, so there's more coming. Also in the early stages of some more stories using experimental structures and methods, so there's more where this came from!",t3_dxsyq9
f871woj,t1_f86elu3,Thanks! And I'm from the Midwest but I tend not to get more specific than that. I just pick up weird slang from other generations/regions that I like to use in everyday conversation,t3_dxsyq9
f7y5hty,t1_f7xlhw5,"Agreed, though I think the argument can be made that since it is a person texting (and it's possible they're unhinged), the your/you're can be switched and it still makes sense",t3_dxsyq9
f7x7twy,t1_f7x7s6r,"25 per hour for the first hour or two...  then nom-stop, lol",t3_dxsyq9
f7w7mp3,t1_f7w64eu,"I should've said ""loosely based"" and yeah I'm fine haha",t3_dxsyq9
f80h6oy,t1_f7x7m9d,Well I'd definitely be interested in some of your other stories!,t3_dxsyq9
f7ydpjy,t1_f7y5hty,"That was my intent, also why there's no punctuation in his messages. The only thing I wanted to do was have him capitalize Amber, kinda implying he took specific care writing her name",t3_dxsyq9
f7y8cgs,t1_f7y5hty,Your maths is blowing up my mind...,t3_dxsyq9
f7x811c,t1_f7x7twy,This is somehow the most valid criticism I've ever received on anything I've ever written lol,t3_dxsyq9
f7xnz45,t1_f7w7mp3,Call your mum back,t3_dxsyq9
f7y8ev6,t1_f7y8cgs,Boom. ðŸ¤¯,t3_dxsyq9
f7x82tm,t1_f7x811c,"Lol, this mama writer really liked it. Keep it up!!",t3_dxsyq9
