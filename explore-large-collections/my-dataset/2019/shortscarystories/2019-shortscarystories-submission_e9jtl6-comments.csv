Also, I feel inclined to write that if you're considering suicide, please reach out to people, make a New Year's resolution for self-improvement, remember what you're looking forward to in the future.",t3_e9jtl6
fajqbog,t3_e9jtl6,"You wrote that your character wanted to be rid of the pain, but pain isnâ€™t the only thing we feel.",t3_e9jtl6
fajlz4c,t1_fajchf5,"I like this one.

Your style is good, the story is creepy, but I think you can up the scariness a little more. I think the emotions aren't hitting quite right, and the build-up was not quite enough and could go further. But this is better than what I can do.

Great job!",t3_e9jtl6
