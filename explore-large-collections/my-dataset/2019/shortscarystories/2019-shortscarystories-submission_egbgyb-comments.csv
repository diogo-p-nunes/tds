fc5ukie,t3_egbgyb,Jimmy's momma always told him that drinking Moonshine would kill him. *Always listen to your momma.*,t3_egbgyb
fc7lk1c,t3_egbgyb,I don’t exacty get it. Explanation?,t3_egbgyb
fc5vbop,t1_fc5ukie,That’s right! Bill’s mom probably didn’t like him hanging out with the likes of Jimmy either. This could have all been avoided!,t3_egbgyb
fc8135f,t1_fc7lk1c,"It wasn't my best work. I tried a longer version but it got pulled from nosleep for not being horror. It's probably just a flawed concept, at least the way I tried to write it.

Basically, Jimmy believes that Bill is a werewolf. He's drinking moonshine and not taking his heart meds. Before he realizes that Bill isn't a werewolf, he has a heart attack and dies. That takes away that threat, but now Bill is still stuck chained to the tree to die of thirst or be eaten by scavengers.",t3_egbgyb
fc5vgf0,t1_fc5vbop,If only they had listened.,t3_egbgyb
fc82qyo,t1_fc8135f,I for sure thought that Jimmy will be the werewolf,t3_egbgyb
fc81tnu,t1_fc8135f,"Nice, good story too",t3_egbgyb
fc83p5s,t1_fc82qyo,"Me too when writing it! Especially when he got sicker as he pulled the silver bullet out. I just kind of let this one flow out. 

In the longer version after Jimmy dies and the scavengers approach, Bill admits to killing Emily on “that night” not because he’s a werewolf, but because she was pregnant with his child and was going to tell Jimmy.",t3_egbgyb
fc81y2g,t1_fc81tnu,Thank you!,t3_egbgyb
