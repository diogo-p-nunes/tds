fc6jmr7,t3_eggfi2,"Second paragraph-“uninvited”.  Perhaps “invited”.  That said, I love this...more, please!",t3_eggfi2
fc6n21j,t3_eggfi2,"I love how ominous this is,and interesting to interpret, like it could be a vampire obsessing over these things and putting multiple pieces of fake info in to trick people, or it could be an actual vampire hunter gathering info, etc, etc",t3_eggfi2
fc6yfjy,t3_eggfi2,This was fun!,t3_eggfi2
fc7e2af,t3_eggfi2,"That last line...
OP is definitely NOT a vampire🤔😨",t3_eggfi2

fc87dxt,t3_eggfi2,So do you... uh... I mean they... do they have a reaction to garlic?,t3_eggfi2
fcjdean,t3_eggfi2,Vampires hating Garlic is vampire propaganda to get more people to eat it so they could have garlic flavoured people,t3_eggfi2
fc7kb9d,t3_eggfi2,So the counting part was a reference to sesame street. What were the other parts a reference to? Especially the obsession with organization and symmetry,t3_eggfi2
fc7dxl3,t3_eggfi2,Loved it!!! More!,t3_eggfi2

fc72rmn,t1_fc6jmr7,"Oops that was a type-o-negative typo. Thank you, my prey",t3_eggfi2
fc7lw8a,t1_fc7kb9d,"Actually  there are myths that say vampires are obsessed with counting stuff. If one is after you, you drop a load of beads or similar items on the floor and they'll stop to count them, giving you a chance to escape.",t3_eggfi2
fc8030b,t1_fc7kb9d,"> So the counting part was a reference to sesame street.

Its actually the other way around- the count is a vampire because in [some folklore vampires compulsively count things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmomania).",t3_eggfi2
fcalibl,t1_fc7kb9d,"The counting aspect is a genuine piece of vampire lore. Mulder uses this knowledge to distract a vampire in an X-Files episode, so it must be real.",t3_eggfi2
fc8zwir,t1_fc8wu90,"Thanks, I worried that it's a bit incoherent, I wrote it pretty quickly!",t3_eggfi2
fovzn3q,t1_fovsdga,"It bugged me how ""Cape"" and ""Fake"" is a slightly inelegant rhyme.",t3_eggfi2
fc803is,t1_fc8030b,"**Arithmomania**

Arithmomania is a mental disorder that may be seen as an expression of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Individuals suffering from this disorder have a strong need to count their actions or objects in their surroundings.Sufferers may for instance feel compelled to count the steps while ascending or descending a flight of stairs or to count the number of letters in words. They often feel it is necessary to perform an action a certain number of times to prevent alleged calamities. Other examples include counting tiles on the floor or ceiling, the number of lines on the highway, or simply the number of times one breathes or blinks, or touching things a certain number of times such as a door knob or a table.
