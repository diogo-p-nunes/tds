f8h1jn2,t3_e0tg4q,"Sorry if this isn't that good. I'm not much of a writer myself, but I just had this sudden idea of making a story about how violence in young people is framed by video games, when things like domestic abuse is still very big and is a much bigger issue among children than video games are made out to be. I probably could've structured this better, but this is what I came up with. Hopefully you guys like it :)

Edit: took me so long to realizethis didn't format right! I don't know how to format poems but this has a rhyme scheme that I took so long to follow and reddit doesn't let me start new lines early without mashing everything together :(",t3_e0tg4q
f8jo7c7,t3_e0tg4q,"Really good story, I think its funny to think that if this story really happened, people would still say that ""if this kid wasn't playing violent games, he wouldn't have killed his father"" ignoring the fact that there was clearly domestic abuse",t3_e0tg4q

f8ha907,t3_e0tg4q,"It is amazing, if not the best writing i have seen the idea is on spot, the theme I agree more than possible and the development to it was nice.

Also the commentary on the retarded way some people see this is spot on.",t3_e0tg4q
