f9nyyzu,t1_f8wequp,"I think they were bringing human meat to thanksgiving dinner, but they crashed the car after hitting some deer and the meat was taken by wild animals while they were unconscious. At the end they're planning to kill whoever is in the yellow jeep in order to replace the lost meat.",t3_e1mibr
