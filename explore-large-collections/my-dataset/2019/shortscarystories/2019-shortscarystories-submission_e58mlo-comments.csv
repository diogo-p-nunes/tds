f9kkke3,t3_e58mlo,"This reminded me of the alleged “Stink Spirit” from Spirited Away. Dirty boi’s appearance was a mere manifestation of the greed and corruption of the Spirit World, which had warped him into something filthy, depraved, and beyond recognition. Everywhere he went, the ground was covered in the sludge that covered him, and there seemed no end to it. It took a great deal of effort from the pure-hearted protogatonist to purify him, and it took a literal bath to make this feat happen. After the ordeal, fresh gold (and grass, perhaps? Idk) sprouted in the tracks that he left.

I hope that by the end, such a fate awaits Earth.",t3_e58mlo
