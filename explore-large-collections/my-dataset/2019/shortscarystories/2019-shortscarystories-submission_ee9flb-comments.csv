fbrq3ia,t3_ee9flb,"No happiness here, this was heartbreaking. I just hope Mr.Bunny is okay and is taking care of the child in the afterlife.

Mr.Bunny aside, Story feels kinda more sad than scary, but with all the story I've been reading, I thought that the plot twist is ""OooOOoo I am not Death, I will eat your soul little kid."", but no. It was his dad, releasing his son from the pain. Good story. I wonder how I would deal with it if my future son is connected to life support?",t3_ee9flb
fbsbo2q,t3_ee9flb,Got me out here about to cry in public. Sad story and definitely didn't see the twist ending coming.,t3_ee9flb
fbt0rt3,t3_ee9flb,"These kind of situations always make me ponder voluntary euthanasia, and hope for the day it's legal for everyone, everywhere. People have the right to die with dignity, and with as little pain as possible. Thank you for your story",t3_ee9flb
fbrulki,t3_ee9flb,"I thought this was going to be like the moment in *On A Pale Horse* by Piers Anthony - Zane (Death) normally only personally collects people with souls in balance, but accidentally gets directed to a kid that's about to die of a seizure.",t3_ee9flb
fbt5xhl,t3_ee9flb,"this is really touchy, my cousin had the same fate. he was 9 years old with a stage 4 cancer. i felt my strings while reading this. thank you",t3_ee9flb

fbtxksp,t3_ee9flb,"Oh *man*. It was okay-sad when you thought Death was actually taking him to heaven, but then that twist.... very well done!",t3_ee9flb
fbu3lbh,t3_ee9flb,The twist at the ending 10/10. The concept of the story is 10/10. Amazing writing overall. Bravo,t3_ee9flb

fbxcn39,t1_fbx58ze,"I assumed Oliver was half-asleep, he saw the dark figure in the middle of the night after having another nightmare, and didn't recognize his dad's voice. When I was a kid and my grandma used to dress as Santa on Christmas Eve, I didn't recognize him either - it was such an emotional moment that I didn't notice the familiarity of his voice or that I saw that nose before :)",t3_ee9flb

fbs91sf,t1_fbrzqpk,"I've read all but the last book in the series, and I can't decide if I really want to read the last one.

I think Xanth is on book 50 by now, but I won't read anything new because he made *major* changes to canon. Personally, I think someone else has written everything since about 35 or so because the 'voice' has changed dramatically.",t3_ee9flb
fbuupz6,t1_fbuq8yj,"Don't be, that just means you're doing it right.  Awesome story",t3_ee9flb
