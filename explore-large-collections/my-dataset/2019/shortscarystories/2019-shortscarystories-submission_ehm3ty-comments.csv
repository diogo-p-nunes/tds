fcl5mmo,t3_ehm3ty,"Great story! I like everything about it.

I've noticed that other comments are looking for information about the ""daughter."" Is she really the man's daughter? A victim of human trafficking? Or both? Why is she so dirty? Why doesn't she speak? Is she alive? Dead? A ghost or spirit? Why is it so important to create some kind of identity for her aside from what OP tells us? OP creates a terrifying scenario that needs no adjusting.

What made this story so chilling to me is that we don't know any more than the narrator does, just that this is a very risky situation and the narrator must rely on her instinct to save herself from some unknown fate. Her instinct is validated by the ""daughter"" signalling to her that she needs to go, and she goes. It really doesnt matter who, or what, the daughter is, just that her presence helped the narrator save herself.

Thank you OP. If I had the resources, I'd give you a gold for this wonderful tale.",t3_ehm3ty

fcmbzin,t3_ehm3ty,"Loved it! I'll jump in and add some to the feedback: I think something you could do to better pace the story would be to spread the information about the 'daughter' more. Maybe the first time the character looks at her she realizes she looks tired, the second time notices the dark circles under her eyes, then the mud, and so on. Right now you mention the daughter many times, but on her first mention you tell us about all that (and no one would think that everything is ok with a girl that looks like that). The ending was nice and has strong imagery - by spacing out the info I think it would be even stronger. Keep it up!",t3_ehm3ty

fclwb7o,t3_ehm3ty,"Fun story (well, 'fun' in a scary story kind of way). 

As others have stated, you should definitely look into proper syntax and grammar for stories. It's honestly kind of insane how specific you have to be about some of it, but it does flow better for the reader, line breaks especially.

The core of the story is very well-executed, and the way you write the little girl is great for the foreshadowing it provides. The details you chose are fantastic, and the way that you used said details to hit the reader with the twist without ever saying 'she's a ghost' in any sort of direct way is actually much harder and more uncommon than you would think. 

If you happen to do any writing in the future and need help editing, shoot me a PM. I find editing other people's writing helps me with my own. Cheers!",t3_ehm3ty

fclfm28,t1_fclenzj,"i don‚Äôt find the premise or the way you went about it interesting at all- certainly not enough for 500 upvotes. ‚Äòguy acts friendly but is actually a murderer/child trafficker, tries to lure protag into car, protag runs‚Äô. there‚Äôs nothing here that usually helps create a good story, like mystery, plot twist, or even some kind of climax. it‚Äôs very barebones

the writing style imo comes across like high school creative writing. sentence structure is repetitive, especially with the way you write dialogue: ‚Äòx‚Äô, he exclaims gleefully, flashing his pearly whites. ‚Äòahhh, y‚Äô I reply, playing with my cascading locks of hair.

fckrmwf,t1_fckpd8s,"Imo it depends on what you want to portray. Any style is a good style, as long as it's done consistently. But for short stories, it's more the norm to go for more simplistic descriptions because it paints a more accessible picture in fewer words. It prevents breaking the flow. 


On the other hand, I've seen some beautiful use of complicated and flowery adjectives and writing styles in short stories to keep the twist hidden, to keep the meaning vague, to portray the character of the protagonist, or to draw the reader in completely.


In this case, your protagonist is a youngish child. Simple words work best, because it's how a child or preteen would think. For a 1000 year old vampire protagonist, you need a completely different feel to your writing.

fclvr4u,t1_fclfm28,"Your username is fitting, because you're a dick covered in junk. 

There is nothing wrong with the story other than a few grammatical/formatting errors. The little girl's identity is a mystery, the plot twist is that she's a ghost, and the climax is the narrator figuring it out.   


People have this fascination with trying to make dialogue as 'original' as possible, but most readers don't actually care. The formatting of good dialogue is actually quite utilitarian, it's the words that the characters are speaking to each other that gives it most of the punch.   


You might like stories that are succinct, but other people like atmosphere, which is created by writing in 'unnecessary' details.

You honestly sound like someone who just wrote their first short story and decided that they can now school other people on how to write. And honestly, you're doing it in the most condescending way possible. And that's not even getting into the fact that you opened with a passive-aggressive insult. 

You should spend less time harping on other people for perceived flaws and more on your own work. Taking a 'le stem' approach to a creative art just makes you sound like an asshole.",t3_ehm3ty
