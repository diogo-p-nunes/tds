f9xfo7m,t3_e70c04,"Going to be downvoted, but this is just subpar. I might even call it bad. You dramatized it too much, the prose is too flowery, and it's just boring and predictable. Not to mention, it's not a scary story at all. In fact, there *is* no plot. You can make it better by not being super dramatic with it from the get go; not being so 'on the nose'. Increase it gradually. Give the story a plot.",t3_e70c04
