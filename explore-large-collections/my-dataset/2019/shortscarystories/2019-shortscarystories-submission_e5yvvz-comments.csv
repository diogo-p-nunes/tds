f9orf03,t3_e5yvvz,"Wait, did she put the bully in a cage or something?",t3_e5yvvz
f9n8xio,t3_e5yvvz,"I made the mistake of giggling at the term “looper”, because it sounded so cute—like “goober” or “fruit loop”. On the other hand, dear God—take her away! This is why kids shouldn’t have super-powers. D: Althooough, this kid in particular would be a Dementor’s worst enemy.",t3_e5yvvz
f9ncch7,t3_e5yvvz,"> to escape small animal cage

f9oiugv,t3_e5yvvz,What a satisfying twist,t3_e5yvvz
fcvyy4q,t3_e5yvvz,Am I the only one who read this as if it was from a dog's POV?,t3_e5yvvz
f9p3stc,t3_e5yvvz,"I liked the short story but I would’ve end it differently, erase the last two lines and end it with the first two . Great short story OP (;",t3_e5yvvz

f9na72o,t1_f9n40cd,Seen the movie,t3_e5yvvz
f9py26f,t1_f9n40cd,Yup although the last part was not out yet and I kinda forgot about the whole plot and to lazy to read up again.,t3_e5yvvz
f9n9xdf,t1_f9mqps6,Yess i immediately thought of that movie when they said emma was a looper,t3_e5yvvz
f9nc8op,t1_f9mqps6,Oh ye gods that movie STILL has me slightly paranoid I'm going to suddenly see parts of me disappearing T____T,t3_e5yvvz

f9pxprm,t1_f9p3stc,I completly agree with you...damn missed chance,t3_e5yvvz
f9nwkix,t1_f9na72o,"not to derail the post or anything, but you should read the books too! they’re so much better/different to the movie",t3_e5yvvz
f9nedr8,t1_f9na72o,Kinda reminds me of that. Girl named Emma in a day-long loop that cycles at the end of every day.,t3_e5yvvz
f9q21ju,t1_f9py26f,Lol same!!,t3_e5yvvz
f9nia4k,t1_f9nc8op,"That part was COOL but didn't make any sense, if it is the same you, and you lose a part of you body years ago, you would still remember that, because already happen and it happen to you, not to another version of you. So confusing.",t3_e5yvvz
fcxmxna,t1_fcxkfax,"Haha, I understand the plot now, I just originally thought it was from a dog's point of view because of it being an 11 year old girl's birthday, the cage, etc. Good story though!",t3_e5yvvz
f9op19y,t1_f9nwkix,"Yes!! I read the books first years ago, definitely ruined the movie for me though. They are so much better!",t3_e5yvvz
f9nz547,t1_f9nwkix,I did with Stephen King’s Pet Sematary good book I seen the movie as well,t3_e5yvvz
f9nwqfj,t1_f9nia4k,"Dont forget its a paradox. There are more paradoxal things happening in that scene. There is a possibility this is how the paradox fixes itself.

Because if you lost your arm. Your looper self would have never travelled to the past in the first place. 

So how the paradox fixes itself is that it re arranges itself in a way that you could be there and have those things happen to you.

Edit: Man I love Looper, I saw it on a first date, in my teens. The date worked out, but I didnt do any making out(which is odd for teens) I was so enticed by that movie.",t3_e5yvvz
