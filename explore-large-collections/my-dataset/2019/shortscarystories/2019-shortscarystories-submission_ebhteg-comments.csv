fb5xemr,t3_ebhteg,"But remember, kids! A good submissive will be honest and let the master/mistress know when to stop.

A doormat is not a good submissive.

Also, don't play with knives at home! Do it somewhere else.",t3_ebhteg
fb58imr,t3_ebhteg,Nice work! Got a chill on the last sentence:),t3_ebhteg
fb71iy2,t3_ebhteg,The fact that Alvin squeaked made me think of Alvin and the Chipmunks.,t3_ebhteg
fb59o3a,t3_ebhteg,That was fantastic. Well done :-),t3_ebhteg
fb6corv,t3_ebhteg,"Ugh this is such bad bdsm!!!!! You never leave the room while your sub is restrained!!!!!!! Ever!!!!!!!!!!! Like this is the cardinal rule of rope play/restraint play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rant aside, this was a very good short story! I got chills when the lights were turned on",t3_ebhteg
fb71lha,t3_ebhteg,My dick is so confused,t3_ebhteg
fb5r7vf,t3_ebhteg,"Fuuuck

fb5z0uv,t3_ebhteg,This was so good!!,t3_ebhteg
fb5z1a6,t3_ebhteg,"Couldn’t get Bittaker out of my mind reading this.  Ughhh. Heard he died today, cheers!",t3_ebhteg
fb79c8m,t3_ebhteg,Can someone explain the ending? The story was good though.,t3_ebhteg
fb6ejpe,t3_ebhteg,This is weirder considering the description and name exactly matches lawrence from dangerous fellows lmao. It's good though!,t3_ebhteg
fb5pe9g,t3_ebhteg,What?,t3_ebhteg
fb5n0lt,t3_ebhteg,Damn!,t3_ebhteg
fb6a1hc,t3_ebhteg,I'm a little dumb.. Does the ending mean she just liked the pain that much?,t3_ebhteg
fb61z57,t3_ebhteg,this was so good.,t3_ebhteg
fbd86dj,t3_ebhteg,twisted ... wish i had that kind of control of my emotions,t3_ebhteg
fb7g3jr,t3_ebhteg,This was truly terrifying...yikes,t3_ebhteg
fb7ki0q,t3_ebhteg,"This is pretty good, it was clear where it was going but still good.",t3_ebhteg
fbic9mw,t3_ebhteg,:(,t3_ebhteg
fdi78r3,t3_ebhteg,Holy shit this was incredible,t3_ebhteg
fb61i3j,t1_fb5xemr,Yeah like at the other persons home,t3_ebhteg
fb6e11g,t1_fb5xemr,Your friendly bdsm PSA for the day,t3_ebhteg
fb6gubg,t1_fb6corv,"okay so just out of curiosity, why are you not supposed to leave the room?",t3_ebhteg
fb75ybe,t1_fb6corv,I don't think it was BDSM at that stage...,t3_ebhteg
fb5sugj,t1_fb5r7vf,Good as in scary? Or good as in..,t3_ebhteg
fb7tlc0,t1_fb5r7vf,Same like...the twist is really good and all but inside I'm turning into a lenny face,t3_ebhteg
fb7ktk6,t1_fb79c8m,"I took it to mean they wanted her to say the safe word anyway, but they weren’t going to stop torturing her. Like it’s not as fun to torture someone who’s not resisting.",t3_ebhteg
fb7tq0n,t1_fb6ejpe,"Jeez, I didn't even think of him while reading this, haha. I saw the name ""Lawrence"" and immediately thought of Lawrence from Boyfriend To Death",t3_ebhteg
fb702c2,t1_fb6a1hc,"I take it as, she's become so obsessed with achieving that ultimate submissive sexual high that she's willing to die for it.",t3_ebhteg
fb702kz,t1_fb6a1hc,"I don't think you're dumb. The ending is slightly confusing and hard to understand if you don't know bdsm culture. As far as I can tell, your explanation makes sense!",t3_ebhteg
fb73a2o,t1_fb61i3j,Like in their eye sockets,t3_ebhteg
fb6hh2j,t1_fb6gubg,Safety. If something goes wrong you need to be there to untie them quickly.,t3_ebhteg
fb6mf2h,t1_fb6gubg,"Safety is an issue, but psychological damage via abandonment syndrome can be just as bad or worse. Most good Doms will not leave a sub that's bound in anyway, unless abandonment is part of the subs kink.",t3_ebhteg
fb6hf9l,t1_fb6gubg,They could get hurt and be unable to free themselves. They could die.,t3_ebhteg
fb5tfhl,t1_fb5sugj,I dont find it scary but it's a good twist! But also...some people are into kidnap scenes and stuff like that so this could be framed in that light too lol,t3_ebhteg
fb7tj3k,t1_fb5sugj,"Both, both is good.",t3_ebhteg
fb7mq1q,t1_fb7ktk6,Woah that just blew my mind,t3_ebhteg
fb7a7m4,t1_fb702c2,"Damn, kind of a bummer for the Dom lol.",t3_ebhteg
fb7a71w,t1_fb702kz,"Thank you! Yes, that's what I thought.",t3_ebhteg
fb6phxa,t1_fb6mf2h,"And even so they're usually somewhere very close by, and the sub has ways of releasing themselves if necessary",t3_ebhteg
fb75fki,t1_fb6mf2h,"Ah, that totally makes sense. Thanks for explaining!

Side note: I love it when reddit gives me random knowledge I will probably never make use of in my life.",t3_ebhteg
fb7khjp,t1_fb6mf2h,I feel like....is there some kind of manual out there or something?  lol.,t3_ebhteg
fb7pcpa,t1_fb7khjp,I believe Google is what your after fellow redditor,t3_ebhteg
fe2lpwx,t1_fb7khjp,"There are a lot of books on the subject, but the internet, as always, is a good resource also.",t3_ebhteg
fe8hmci,t1_fe2lpwx,See idk I think the internet would be really dangerous to get answers for this....since there's probably a lot of misinformation given by people who really don't know what they are doing.,t3_ebhteg
