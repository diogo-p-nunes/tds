f8403du,t3_dyijpz,"While not bad, the main problem with this isn't scary. It's interesting and cool, but 'dude with precognition and a creepy hobby' isn't actually frightening, as he- at least from what I can tell- is still, ultimately, not a threat. He saved OP's life.",t3_dyijpz

f840cu8,t1_f8403du,"I see your point. To me I think the scary part was more being threatened like that by a stranger but then it turns out to be a scarily accurate precursor to a significant event 5 years down the line. I got the inspiration just listening to a song though haha, I get what youâ€™re sayin though",t3_dyijpz
f840pzt,t1_f840cu8,"I mean, yes that's scary- but not scary _enough_. What you've got is a side character or outsider's pov of a novel protagonist- someone creepy but ultimately benevolent, and benevolence is rarely ever truly frightening. 

I like the idea of you trying to put a spin/twist on it, but it just doesn't work for trying to be fear inducing. If you wanted to keep the twist but make it creepier or more ominous, something like : 

""I told you I'd rip out your heart."" He said, a slow grin spreading over his face- away from his too-sharp teeth- as he winked one bright, amber eye at me. 

Still not GREAT, but it leaves a bit more of the 'dun dun DUUUUN' feel and implies the surgeon isn't human, leaving his motivations a bit more up in the air.",t3_dyijpz
f842wdm,t1_f840pzt,"Gotcha, so the problem is more that thereâ€™s ultimately nothing evil about the situation?",t3_dyijpz
f85n4ku,t1_f842wdm,"I don't know why I didn't see this- sorry!  


Yeah, short answer- pretty much that. There's no real threat to the protagonist- nothing evil about the situation, as you say.  Your writing itself is...pretty solid, if not the most poetic, though, so props on that one. :)",t3_dyijpz
