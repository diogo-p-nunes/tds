f9wswxd,t3_e79xa8,"Damn you, ice cream man. 

Some of the best horror stories take a seemingly innocent thing, and change it's normal environment. Then with a little tweaking, the mundane, becomes terrifying.  Good one OP.",t3_e79xa8
f9xokel,t3_e79xa8,"I would change the last line- it just sounds awkward to me. Something like ‚ÄúI knew it was too late‚Äù or something along those lines would sound better, in my humble opinion.",t3_e79xa8
fa1u57f,t3_e79xa8,Wow love it üòç,t3_e79xa8
fa38uco,t3_e79xa8,This story reminds me of that one charmed episode about the Ice cream man that would snatch demonic kids with that ice cream truck jingle and the kids would basically be vanquished in the truck,t3_e79xa8
fa0650y,t3_e79xa8,"Brilliant story. Could have ended it with ""everything instantly clicked together in my mind"" without the other exposition though.",t3_e79xa8
