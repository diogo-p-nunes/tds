f7aeluy,t3_durzpk,"I like it.  I read through your comment chain to fully get it (wish I spoke better Spanish).  I think it could be really good with a little tweaking.  For example, a simple mention of bad weather (""The kids'll be waiting in the rain if I don't leave now."") could build some unpleasant thoughts for the reader.

Would you have other work that features Spanish?  I would like to read it.",t3_durzpk
f77vipe,t3_durzpk,"Sorry, I didn't get it. And I'm spanish",t3_durzpk
f7aepsh,t1_f7aeluy,"Thank you for liking it. Thank you for the advice. Unfortunately, no, I don’t have other stories with Spanish. Hopefully that changes soon!",t3_durzpk

f7aghl5,t1_f7aepsh,"I apologize.  I could have worded my recommendations better.  I know that was unsolicited.  I hope I didn't offend you.

I will be looking forward to it if it does.  I followed you so hopefully I'll catch a Spanish story if you ever post another one.

EDIT

Thanks for sharing the story.  I do like it.  It's got me thinking of how else it might play out.",t3_durzpk
f7827h7,t1_f77vl91,"That doesn't really make any sense tough. The computer is literally saying ""help them"" and ""eliminate this, eliminate us"", I don't see how that relates to her kids.",t3_durzpk
f7agjlv,t1_f7aghl5,"No need to apologize. It’s alright. 

I’m glad! I hope so too.",t3_durzpk
f782jk0,t1_f7827h7,"“Them” refers to her children. 

“Eliminate this” means “Eliminate this program”. The system wants her to delete the program, since an unknown interference is messing with its programming.",t3_durzpk
f782pdd,t1_f782jk0,"I understand that ""Them"" meant her children, but how would the program know that the kids are in danger? How would eliminating the program help? How come someone who regularly works with an AI that teaches spanish doesn't know the language?",t3_durzpk
f782vf8,t1_f782pdd,"The program is being affected by a paranormal entity. 

Deleting the program would stop the interference. 

She doesn’t know much Spanish.",t3_durzpk
f782yoe,t1_f782vf8,Is said entity also threatening her kids?,t3_durzpk
f782zye,t1_f782yoe,No. It’s just being paranoid.,t3_durzpk
f7831yf,t1_f782zye,"Oh, that makes sense then.",t3_durzpk
f78337h,t1_f7831yf,Good. I’m sorry if I came off defensive.,t3_durzpk
f7835d4,t1_f78337h,"Nah, it's all good. Sorry for being a little agressive at first.",t3_durzpk
f7836uu,t1_f7835d4,No. No. It’s okay.,t3_durzpk
