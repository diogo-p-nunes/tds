fai2ww6,t3_e9b140,Wow that was really good. But I hated that cliff hanger,t3_e9b140
fahn8nu,t3_e9b140,Thanks for taking the time reading my little story. Here's my subreddit if you're interested in more stories: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd\_directions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/),t3_e9b140
fajrqvj,t3_e9b140,How did you get from your crush convincing you to sneak away and holding your hand to holding godknowswhats hand on a Ferris wheel? It still shook me but that part was confusing. Was it like a house of horrors or something? Seems like a lot of time to turn your head: going from walking up to a Ferris wheel; past the operator; climbing into the seat; getting latched in; to being at the top of it. Still creepy though,t3_e9b140
fajems3,t1_fai2ww6,"Thanks! And yes, I'm sorry about the cliffhanger but I'm bad at showing the monster without it being anti-climatic.",t3_e9b140
fajsed4,t1_fajrqvj,"Thanks. I imagined it was a doppelgänger, and at the moment of realisation facing the ""fake"" crush was terrifying, knowing it was something not human.",t3_e9b140
fak8n0w,t1_fajsed4,Yes. This is awesome.,t3_e9b140
fak98du,t1_fajsed4,"Ok, this is much creepier than I imagined. And that is a hell of a monster btw. Just “your crush” sitting there, staring at you, silent, expressionless",t3_e9b140
faler05,t1_fak8n0w,Thank you! :),t3_e9b140
falesof,t1_fak98du,Exactly. :),t3_e9b140
