fcoamp4,t3_ei7dg1,"Hello! Here’s some constructive feedback: 

1)  There are a few typos and some sentencing that can be clearer. We all make these mistakes, even I do. I find reading aloud helps me catch more of them (then having a friend read afterwards to be sure). 

2)  Describe a bit more. It’s clear the character is in space and that their device is alerting them to a threat. Set the scene to really create that sense of terror for the reader. Start with the 5 senses: what does the narrator see or not see? Hear? Smell? etc. Have fun, don’t worry about the turn out. The most important thing is to just keep writing and honing your skills. 

3) Describe the creature in more detail if your narrator got a good look at it (which it seems they did). If you prefer to leave something to the imagination, pick one or two senses instead. This will help you create an effect of paranoia, and drum up some fear too. 
      For example: “In the darkness, I could barely make out the shape of something abnormally too tall to be human, before it vanished into the tunnel. The ship stank of blood and excrement.” 

4) Fact check. This makes the story more believable, even in the times we might make something up using real info. The ISS is not run by NATO (an intergovernmental military alliance between 29 countries). The ISS is a partnership between multiple countries, including China, Japan, and Canada amongst others. Since some countries affiliated with NATO also take part in the ISS program, this means that most if not all of your characters would be murdering one another on the ship almost indiscriminately. This eliminates/minimizes the need for a monster to begin with. But hey, maybe now you have a story about homicidal astronauts in space, which can also be scary (and cool!). 

If any of the above facts are different/changed to match your story, that’s OK. Happens in writing all the time. But you have to let the reader know *why* in a way that seems plausible (for example, let’s say the story is set 100 years in the future and global alliances have since been restructured). 

5) The introduction and descriptions by the narrator were well done. You could feel the loneliness and isolation that accompanies space travel but also that the character has a strong sense of duty; they’re waiting patiently for further instructions instead of whining about their colleagues or going home. I also liked the visuals you painted with the lights on Earth flickering. 

I know this is a short story sub but feel like if you extended this a bit (let’s say minimum 500 words) it’ll help your piece build more depth. It’s already there, it just needs a bit more room for development. 

I hope you find this feedback useful in some way. Personally, I think there’s no point in being mean-spirited when making critiques because no one learns anything and if we can’t learn, we can’t improve. 

Writing is tough, but keep at it. The main thing is to have fun and explore. Keep practicing and you’ll be amazed at the progress you’ll make. Be absolutely relentless, just keep writing :) 

Thank you for sharing, best wishes on your future works.",t3_ei7dg1

I made a few revisions to my comment a moment ago (Sorry, I’m constantly revising what I write, bad habit, lol). I think I may understand where you’re going but: all the astronauts on the ship are part of the exact same alliance (ISS programme). It’s like shooting oneself in the foot unless you’re setting up a scenario of betrayal/double-cross, in which case it works well. 

Or, do you mean that their respective countries are asking them to kill their colleagues from other countries? 

In which case, why would they be doing that and what do they hope to achieve/contain (virus, AI gone wrong, other alien threat?)? Did a breakdown in Alliances occur and now it’s an “every man for himself” scenario? What political/social conditions caused this breakdown and why did anyone go into space if the alliance was strained/weak to begin with (maybe astronauts are looking for a cure/water?etc.)? 

Overall, it’s still a good story and has a lot of potential.",t3_ei7dg1
