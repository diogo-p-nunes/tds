f9kn35n,t1_f9kmjc0,Funny you mention birds/Griffins I actually named my hunter Owl pet both on Classic/Retail WoW Hedwig. I was going to dismiss Hedwig on classic but I won't now.,t3_e5cr66

f9knt9r,t1_f9kn5il,"Funny you mention Time Travel because I had a dream of the late Doris Day and I was like her daughter lol and there were a bunch of daisies I was trampling on. Anyway, I'm not sure if you like old movies but I remember her movie 'Glass Bottom Boat' which also starred the late Rod Taylor who was also in the original version of The Time Machine. So funny you mentioned it I think it was a premonition for this comment lol",t3_e5cr66
