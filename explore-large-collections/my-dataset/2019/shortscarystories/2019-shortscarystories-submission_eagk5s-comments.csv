fawctgv,t1_farf0f8,"It’s based on a dream I had, where a man was walking home to his cabin with a friend but got separated from the friend and got caught in a storm in the snow and died of hypothermia, and when his friend told the guy’s pregnant wife what happened, she went to the woods and found his body, and died of grief along with the “soon child” in her womb.
