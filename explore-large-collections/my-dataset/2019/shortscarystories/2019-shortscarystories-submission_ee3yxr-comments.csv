John Mayer aside, good story. Emotional, and scary at the same time. Mistakes can happen to everyone, but it can be horrifying if those mistake can make you and your loved one become mashed potato on the ground.

Edit: I just realize they were expecting a baby too. Why are you making me sad?",t3_ee3yxr

fbpewu9,t1_fbpc5hx,"Why thank you! I'm just glad I don't have the pressure of being a parachute rigger where mistakes cost lives. Also, you should check out Tom Petty's Free Fallin'. John Mayer's cover is good but the OG is way better imo.",t3_ee3yxr

Thanks for the recommendation! Never heard the OG before because I'm dumb. I'd probably like it more. Thank you!",t3_ee3yxr
