f9p88i2,t3_e6bl1a,"Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but is the story that they have kids just to kill them?",t3_e6bl1a
f9p2m9g,t3_e6bl1a,Well done. I can often predict the direction of these things but I didnâ€™t see this one coming!,t3_e6bl1a
f9p5nok,t3_e6bl1a,"Eh OP, I don't think its a good idea to kill another one, the police may actually hone in, a lot were cracked because the murderers kept killing people close to them.

Anyway, good story! I actually figured OP killed the first Brian, but I didn't expect Ted to be in it as well, I thought he genuinely didn't know how his first son died.",t3_e6bl1a
f9p7s8c,t3_e6bl1a,"I figured out the twist kind of, However I more so aimed for the mom to be crazy and the one doing it and the dad not knowing.",t3_e6bl1a
f9p4fzg,t3_e6bl1a,Loved the twist!,t3_e6bl1a
f9p8k28,t3_e6bl1a,Woooooooooowww!! The title primes you to read the story in a certain way and you think the story is building in a certain direction until theast sentence. Great job!! Loved it!,t3_e6bl1a
f9pbejb,t3_e6bl1a,Do they eat their own children? Or did my mind just make that up.,t3_e6bl1a
f9p5yus,t3_e6bl1a,That's seriously creepy. Well done!,t3_e6bl1a
f9p85vl,t3_e6bl1a,"Good story. Great twist--I didn't see this coming at all. (If it had been a girl, I wonder what they would have named her.) Well done indeed!",t3_e6bl1a
f9pbo4c,t3_e6bl1a,This was bloody brilliant.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pgvn9,t3_e6bl1a,Yeah parents eating their kids is fucked up but this twist made me like happy ish just because of how dark it could have gotten eg: OPs husband leaves her so she kills herself with baby.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pik7j,t3_e6bl1a,Can't believe I didn't think of that. Thanks.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pn6or,t3_e6bl1a,Why though?,t3_e6bl1a
f9pqn8o,t3_e6bl1a,"And that, children, is how I met your mother.",t3_e6bl1a
f9r6aqc,t3_e6bl1a,I thought it was gonna turn out that the narrator was a guy with an alien embryo in him! Lol,t3_e6bl1a
f9r9tob,t3_e6bl1a,May your ritual go well and our dark Lord Satan gift you all your black heart desires.,t3_e6bl1a
f9sevet,t3_e6bl1a,Nice twist at the end. Would you mind if I narrated this on my channel?,t3_e6bl1a
f9suhhq,t3_e6bl1a,"How long was this woman pregnant? From early December to next September? I liked the story anyway though, good job",t3_e6bl1a
f9ppdu5,t3_e6bl1a,"I saw the twist coming but that's not even what made it not connect, for me it that we have no idea why they're waiting until a year in or why in the first place. There needs to be some hint as to why they're doing whatever they do or what they do. I'd suggest they're putting him up for sale, a cult ritual or a sacrifice for unrealistic reasons.",t3_e6bl1a
f9p7njj,t3_e6bl1a,September 13th is my birthday too! Awesome story!,t3_e6bl1a
f9p8ver,t3_e6bl1a,So they have kids just to kill em?,t3_e6bl1a
f9q1vvf,t3_e6bl1a,i thought Ted was the killer! nice story,t3_e6bl1a
f9q5af4,t3_e6bl1a,Please what is the meaning of OP?,t3_e6bl1a
f9qeciv,t3_e6bl1a,"The tone of all the paragraphs.. the way you bait the reader to get hooked is *literally perfect*. Very well done sir, hats off.",t3_e6bl1a
faxoetr,t3_e6bl1a,"This was your first posting here? I can't wait for the next one. 

This story was good. What creepy people!",t3_e6bl1a
fbepe74,t3_e6bl1a,Lil Brian Bundy and his dad Ted,t3_e6bl1a
f9pjz8v,t3_e6bl1a,"Fuuuuuck nice one. I thought it was mean Ted all along, but the wife's into it as well. Gave me the chills.",t3_e6bl1a
f9pnkw5,t3_e6bl1a,This will need an origin story and a follow through. Honestly very good. Gg OP,t3_e6bl1a
f9rvgyz,t3_e6bl1a,TosssssesesjaÂ£*#,t3_e6bl1a
f9sqy5q,t3_e6bl1a,[deleted],t3_e6bl1a
f9svtf8,t3_e6bl1a,"great story! I was a bit trown off by the police finding a clue as big as the killing weapon and then dropping the case three days after, I'm assuming it wasn't the actual weapon, but if so that part of the story feels a little irrelevant, either way, very nice story!",t3_e6bl1a
f9sw7xe,t3_e6bl1a,I regret reading this,t3_e6bl1a
f9t4aju,t3_e6bl1a,Okay thanks.,t3_e6bl1a
f9ti3ji,t3_e6bl1a,"Welp, that's enough reddit for today.",t3_e6bl1a
f9ylae8,t3_e6bl1a,We need a movie,t3_e6bl1a
f9yt2on,t3_e6bl1a,Didn't see that one coming... Well written!,t3_e6bl1a
fa9vf2b,t3_e6bl1a,"Only issue I have with this story is why would the police contact you to say they have potentially found the murder weapon used in the murder of your child, and then close the case 3 days later? Those timings seem a bit off",t3_e6bl1a
fc788aq,t3_e6bl1a,THIS IS CREEEEPY I GOT CHILLS AT THE ENDING,t3_e6bl1a
f9pvuya,t3_e6bl1a,This was very Well made!,t3_e6bl1a
f9q17cx,t3_e6bl1a,First post I read on this sub and bravo! This was great - didn't expect the twist at all!,t3_e6bl1a
f9py8g4,t3_e6bl1a,Brilliant story. Well done,t3_e6bl1a
f9pd766,t1_f9p88i2,Yup,t3_e6bl1a
f9p3i4y,t1_f9p2m9g,Omg! Thank you so much! This is my first post on here so I was a little nervous but this honestly made my day!,t3_e6bl1a
f9p7gp0,t1_f9p5nok,I was expecting the opposite - Ted was the killer and OP had no clue what would happen to this new child.,t3_e6bl1a
f9rb121,t1_f9p7s8c,Same.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pdcuc,t1_f9pbejb,Maybe they'll step it up on the next child,t3_e6bl1a
f9pddok,t1_f9p85vl,Brianne.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pf24w,t1_f9pbo4c,I really liked this.  Iâ€™d be interested in the why... human sacrifice? Sociopaths? Very good!,t3_e6bl1a
f9rb9nn,t1_f9pn6or,Some people are crazy. :(,t3_e6bl1a
f9sgfct,t1_f9sevet,Go ahead! But please give me credit. And can I have the name of your channel so I can watch the video when it comes out? I really appreciate it!,t3_e6bl1a
f9qg1ng,t1_f9ppdu5,"Thanks for your feedback, I really appreciate it. I was thinking the reason they waited a year was because that time was spent planning everything to make sure they don't get caught or suspected. Other than that, I'll leave it to your imagination to find out why they kill the babies.",t3_e6bl1a
f9q23ji,t1_f9p8ver,Is OP a dad?? Yikessss.,t3_e6bl1a
f9sa08h,t1_f9q5af4,Original poster. People in the comments mean by that the pregnant mom who is telling the story,t3_e6bl1a
f9qhh9f,t1_f9q5af4,"Basically, they have babies just to kill them.",t3_e6bl1a
f9srvmf,t1_f9sqy5q,I'm glad you enjoyed it! It was supposed to mean that he was scared of being caught by the police because the police might suspect them,t3_e6bl1a
faabjx0,t1_fa9vf2b,"Thank you for your feedback! Since I was trying to keep the story short, I couldn't go into the details but basically, they found a potential murder weapon but it ended up being nothing.",t3_e6bl1a
f9ph6ow,t1_f9pd766,Are they like eating them or sacrificing them to demonic god or is it just how they entertain themselves?,t3_e6bl1a
f9pvttq,t1_f9pd766,"Admittedly, I thought they were kidnapping the kids from other parents, and the first Brian was a fuck-up that left the kid dead in a botched attempt at taking him. And they waited for the year to make sure this new baby would be old enough to not get killed in the scuffle this time.",t3_e6bl1a
f9pkptd,t1_f9p7gp0,"I also thought the mother was the only killer because she kept mentioning how upset Ted was from Brianâ€™s death.

After a re-read though, I noticed a different tone to the motherâ€™s thoughts and didnâ€™t see Ted as just an innocent anymore. Well done OP! Such a well executed lil story!",t3_e6bl1a
f9r5ehx,t1_f9p7gp0,"I as well, was surprised see this.
Also, I'm new to Reddit and have no idea what OP stands for can someone tell meðŸ˜‚",t3_e6bl1a
f9w85si,t1_f9p7gp0,Same!!,t3_e6bl1a
f9t11zi,t1_f9sgfct,Of course! Heres my channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQoMWy55g46JQlIYYsUjbSA,t3_e6bl1a
f9t127p,t1_f9sgfct,Of course! Heres my channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQoMWy55g46JQlIYYsUjbSA,t3_e6bl1a
f9sady3,t1_f9qg1ng,Really good! I saw a forensic files episode similar to this and there is no explanation- theyâ€™re sick people so leaving it open was realistic and chilling for me :),t3_e6bl1a
f9q26nl,t1_f9q23ji,No,t3_e6bl1a
f9sgifn,t1_f9q23ji,"nope, OP is the one doing the pregnancy tests so she must be a mother",t3_e6bl1a
faacx7l,t1_faabjx0,"Yeah no totally get that, but it seems a bit off timing wise to me to have them find a potential murder weapon almost a year after the crime and then close the investigation 3 days later, if they found a potential murder weapon Iâ€™d assume that would mean they are still very involved in the investigation, so it didnâ€™t make sense to me for them to then end the investigation 3 days after is all.

Love the story though and thanks for replying! Itâ€™s always great when the author replies cause you can get a proper insight into what they were thinking",t3_e6bl1a
f9ph9gk,t1_f9ph6ow,"To be honest, I just thought about them killing the kids but now that everyone is mentioning the eating part and stuff, I'll just leave it to your imagination",t3_e6bl1a
f9r63u1,t1_f9r5ehx,OP means original poster. But in this context i think he means the narrator? i.e mom,t3_e6bl1a
f9phdzf,t1_f9ph9gk,The big enough comment in the end made me think they are eating them.,t3_e6bl1a
f9pphsm,t1_f9ph9gk,I think this is what's missing from resonating with people more. There's a level of openness that never should be left to the reader,t3_e6bl1a
fbbsz5q,t1_f9ph9gk,"I'm late, but I thought they moved town to town every so often killing their child and taking up a new home after x number of years.

Then one day one of them falls in love with their prey...",t3_e6bl1a
f9r6f7h,t1_f9r63u1,Thanks! That helps a lot,t3_e6bl1a
f9seou7,t1_f9pphsm,"Ambiguity can make good stories great, I think it's better that they left it open to the reader

> I can't wait to eat another kid

Just doesn't have the same effect imo",t3_e6bl1a
fbbsztx,t1_fbbsz5q," Hi late,, I'm Dad!",t3_e6bl1a
