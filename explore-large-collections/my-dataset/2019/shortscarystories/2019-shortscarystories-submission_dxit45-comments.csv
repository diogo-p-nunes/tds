f7qv12t,t3_dxit45,"Due to the rut, all of the highway signs in the area just say ""watch for deer"". While doing errands earlier, I jokingly pointed out that that would sound pretty ominous if you had no idea what a deer was. That inspired me to write my first short story for you all!

Good luck to everyone going out this month to try and fill your Creature tags.",t3_dxit45
f7r5p31,t3_dxit45,Bravo!! I had created an image in my head of the creature and it was definitely not a deer!!,t3_dxit45
f7y8yyu,t3_dxit45,Moved from a city to northern Maine and had to learn the “just hit it if you can’t slow down fast enough” thing the hard way earlier this year. Just last week there were four in the road and I had to give one a light tap when it jumped in front of me for some stupid deer reason,t3_dxit45
f7qzygc,t3_dxit45,love the concept ! absolutely fantastic!,t3_dxit45

f7z6hca,t1_f7y8yyu,"I've heard people from the city describe them as these majestic, beautiful creatures... nah, they're dumb as shit.",t3_dxit45
f7wkln3,t1_f7w8aa9,"I've made more venison than I can remember, the Creatures are pretty tasty with garlic and herbs on a roast.",t3_dxit45
