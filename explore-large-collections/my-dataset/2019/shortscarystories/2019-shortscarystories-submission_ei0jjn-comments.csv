fcmo37f,t3_ei0jjn,"Damn, that plot twist made me stop for a second there, just like that baby.

Jokes about dead baby aside, nice one. Very straight forward and that plot twist came out of nowhere. I like how in the first few paragraph, the reader would be wondering what kind of memory is this. Is it abuse? Is she seeing a monster? Nope, she's killing a baby. I also love how the first paragraph also hint the twist at us, talking about ""welcome silence"". Good story.",t3_ei0jjn

fcnlpkk,t1_fcn42wz,It can help in some circumstances. If somebody figures out whatâ€™s going to happen there are two reactions. There the one where the reader becomes more interested or read it so that they can just get done with it.,t3_ei0jjn
