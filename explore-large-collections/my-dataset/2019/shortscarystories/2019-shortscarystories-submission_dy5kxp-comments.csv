f7zhxmm,t3_dy5kxp,Good story. Great imagination,t3_dy5kxp
f7zpndz,t3_dy5kxp,"Good example of the quieter horrors of war. 

Also, you pluck a turkey. 

Thanks for writing!",t3_dy5kxp
f7z2iva,t3_dy5kxp,"“...then for the children!” not “...than for the children!” Just an FYI. Good story, though I’m not sure why the turn turkey meat into teddy bears. That threw me off. Fun read though",t3_dy5kxp
f814kf8,t3_dy5kxp,"Okay but... I literally just saw someone post something on Facebook about advertising their services in reconstructing raw thanksgiving turkeys into teddy bears, complete with a--to say the least--grotesque picture. I have no idea if you saw it or not, but the fact that it came up in this story gave me a double take. *shivers*",t3_dy5kxp
f7yzcvs,t1_f7yyq7w,"The ending is that the whole town had died because of the poisoned food/turkeys and that the war, which the townspeople thought of as outside of their lives came to destroy everything right beneath their nose. There is no greater horror than the one which sneaks right up to you and with a whisper burns everything you have ever known away and leaves nothing but death and silence behind.",t3_dy5kxp
f7zijbm,t1_f7zhxmm,Thank you! :),t3_dy5kxp
f7z2rgj,t1_f7z2iva,"First off, brb eating some poisoned turkey for that grammar mistake haha but second that was just a bit of world building that I wanted to leave open to the reader to make them feel more immersed in a custom they have no background with if that makes sense? 

Thanks for reading and the correction :)",t3_dy5kxp
f816cft,t1_f814kf8,"Good eye! That borderline horrific advert was my inspiration for sure but I felt it just needed a little twist, all in all whether you found this story before or after I think really adds to the idea of not knowing whats behind the things we see and potentially eat. 

Glad to give you some shivers at least :,)",t3_dy5kxp
f7zjifl,t1_f7zijbm,You’re welcome. I hope you write more,t3_dy5kxp
f7z3hmy,t1_f7z2rgj,"Yeah I get it, and maybe the ripping away of a society I didn’t get a chance to know is the real horror intended?",t3_dy5kxp
f7z3wro,t1_f7z3hmy,"Yup! I’m glad you found that extra layer to the story as it is relevant to the real world as well, like how many times have we seen a face on the television or a place we have never been to but understand that when the buildings are destroyed something is invariably lost and potentially never to be regained? 

It’s a potent mix of tragedy and horror indeed.",t3_dy5kxp
