fbsyfz1,t3_eecuds,"That's why you don't investigate screams in the forest without 10 more people backing you up, you might end up dying because an owl is being a dickhead toward a drunk person.

Troll Owl aside, I like the story. The way it's written is good, but the ""falling on his ass"" part is a little bit weird :p The description of the beast is good too, and the twist was nice, seeing as there's no monster, just the darkness and drunkness creating one for him. Scary too, since you never know if the thing in the dark is just a creepy illusion created by things going together well, or really something waiting to harm you. Good story.",t3_eecuds
