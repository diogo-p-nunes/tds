fa92rvq,t3_e7k1ln,"I'm guessing this was a much longer story that was whittled down to less than 500 words?

I enjoyed it and the idea behind it, but having to keep track of all the different characters kind of took me out of the story.",t3_e7k1ln
fa1e2jz,t3_e7k1ln,Can someone explain what happened?,t3_e7k1ln
fa9tyyz,t1_fa92rvq,"Not much longer. If I kept everything I wanted to put in it, it would run to maybe 650 words. But I see how it might work better as a slower story of more regular length. Thanks for the feedback!",t3_e7k1ln
fa1ia8e,t1_fa1e2jz,"I think they are vampires who have just figured out that all of the things that humans are supposed to be able to use to stop them (can’t come in without an invite, can’t cross running water, can’t stand garlic) don’t have an effect on them.",t3_e7k1ln
fa1mf57,t1_fa1ia8e,"Without meaning to impose my headcanon when perhaps I should've made it more explicit, they do *generally* have an effect (the dog and either Doman or Zavid don't survive the river) but it gets complicated when a vampire religion enters the picture. The most consistent explanation is that the collective human belief in things that protect them from vampires becomes a physical/mystical force in its own right, and then is nullified by the vampires' own belief that they have a god who protects them. A kind of reverse *Blade* with a touch of Melisandre.

(I didn't plan any of it; I just wrote the sentence, ""This is as far as we go"", let it grow from there, and ended up not even using that sentence.)",t3_e7k1ln
fa2h9rq,t1_fa1mf57,"I understood the religion part, I was just trying to give a basic explanation for the ask-er to think about in the assumption that they would now reread... and now that I’m saying this, it’s clear I may have been in Teacher Mode on the weekend lol 

Really cool story btw! Are you thinking of expanding it into something longer?",t3_e7k1ln
fa2knwf,t1_fa2h9rq,"Thank you!

Regarding expanding... maybe just a little, to add more detail in a few places. Other than that, it feels complete and I'm already looking forward to writing the next one. Word limits magically make my perpetual writer's block go away, it's almost therapeutic.",t3_e7k1ln
