fauahh0,t3_eajziq,Maybe I'm just dumb but I don't get it.,t3_eajziq
faun440,t3_eajziq,Could someone explain?,t3_eajziq
fauykkv,t3_eajziq,I’m not sure I understand this story,t3_eajziq
faszyrz,t3_eajziq,Interesting......,t3_eajziq
fawg5z3,t3_eajziq,Very vivid without over explaining.  I really like it.,t3_eajziq
favij03,t3_eajziq,"The ending is kinda confusing... I would have liked to read more of how he killed him, like what *really* traumatised him! :-)",t3_eajziq
fb16kmm,t3_eajziq,Why did asshole Jared get sent to the loony bin instead of prison?,t3_eajziq
fci45qx,t3_eajziq,"Nice! Having read the comments I see that I came to a slightly incorrect conclusion but I'd like to share my theory anyways. 

It was my belief that OP has multiple personality disorder. He and Jared are the same person. Loony bin could also mean hospital, 'taking too much' I took as in prescribed pills, we always seem to see 'Jared' & OP in the same place. 

Also the last sentence. I pictured OP as being 'Jared' kicking Bobby (blood on the shoes) and taking the pills helps him control this crazy personality.",t3_eajziq
fayk0zr,t3_eajziq,"I found the line “me, the fucking asshole...” to be really awkward. I feel like I have to point that out because, other than that hiccup, the work you did writing a character was brilliant. A full length story or even a book written to this standard would be a pleasure to read. Very well done.",t3_eajziq
fauu12n,t1_fauahh0,"I maybe read it wrong but I think he is taking drugs to try to forget how his friend killed the boy they were bullying. He's taken an overdose and so he's at the hospital, but he's going to take more drugs to try to forget again. PTSD I guess.",t3_eajziq
faug0ax,t1_fauahh0,Same,t3_eajziq
fauly3q,t1_fauahh0,Schizophrenia or DID,t3_eajziq
favz41x,t1_faun440,"Narrator's best friend Jared was a bully, and narrator egged him on whenever he targetted a kid called Bobby. The narrator has ODed on the drugs he uses to forget the day Jared kicked Bobby to death.",t3_eajziq
faxrw84,t1_fauykkv,No twist huh,t3_eajziq
favmm5i,t1_favij03,"I think the last line says all you need to know, really. Jared literally kicked Bobby to death in front of the narrator, who had been egging Jared's violent behaviour on. I think that's traumatising enough for a teenager, don't you?",t3_eajziq
fav54wn,t1_fauu12n,"That's how I read it. Coping with his involvement in the murder of Bobby with drugs, OD'd (on purpose or on accident), and is either vegetative or has severe neurological damage and is in the hospital hooked up to tubes.",t3_eajziq
fav8t3x,t1_fauu12n,Right on all counts.,t3_eajziq
fauk43m,t1_faug0ax,Same,t3_eajziq
fb3ze57,t1_favmm5i,"I agree. Don't need to spell everything out, seriously.",t3_eajziq
