What, you never seen Santa Claus take a break before? Union rules must be adhered to if Santa in to complete his ever increasing task overnight. You thought UPS had it tough, nobody feels the weight of overpopulation more than the world's favorite fat bastard.
Next time you feel like increasing the number of great unwashed in the world by one or more, consider this:
 
""Don't be a dick, think of Ole Saint Nick""

Wonderfully creepy and long reaching as it puts a hell of a dent in everyone's childhood memories.
