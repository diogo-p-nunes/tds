f7vxw9x,t3_dxptnc,"How used to it must her mum be to react so calm and collected! This is scary and sad, I really liked it.",t3_dxptnc
f7wtw0b,t3_dxptnc,"At this point I would abandon the idea of a grave in favor of a tomb.
There is a high water table level where I live so our graves have a concrete slab over the casket. To keep the casket from rising. 
Seriously, though, humoring her is not helping her. It may be time to consider a caretaker or even mental hospital admittance. As delusional as she is, and the lengths she is going to could indicate dangerous behavioral change.",t3_dxptnc
f7xp7t1,t3_dxptnc,Thanks for the great feedback everyone,t3_dxptnc
f7xaftl,t3_dxptnc,"I really enjoyed this story, however I wanted to let you know for the first time you tried to say ‚Äúvows‚Äù you actually said ‚Äúvowels‚Äù

Edit: finish ‚Äúvowels‚Äù",t3_dxptnc
f7zgzn4,t1_f7yt8vf,I've edited. But my word count at home said 500 words. Can you re-approve please.,t3_dxptnc
fag5zhy,t1_f7wtw0b,I love the amount of knowledge and assistance here. Take my up vote. üòÄ,t3_dxptnc
f7xhh2t,t1_f7xaftl,Silly typo lol,t3_dxptnc
f7zp2gw,t1_f7zgzn4,"Yeah that‚Äôs what I hate about word counters.  When I write stories, I first go by what MS word says and it‚Äôll be like 496! and then I copy/paste to Grammarly to correct any grammar, sentence structure,etc, mainly I just use the word counter available to use here in this subreddit (it‚Äôs considered the official word counter but I think it‚Äôs only available for mods to use. Yours came up with 509 words. Usually I let 501-510, but I gotta enforce the rules every now and then.",t3_dxptnc
f7zp51z,t1_f7zp2gw,No problems... I've trimmed it.,t3_dxptnc
f7zquab,t1_f7zp51z,"In the future I would check MS Word and 2-3 online word countering sits. Worst case scenario, it messes up again and you get the story removed by another mid until you fix it. If I come across it first and it‚Äôs like 10 words over I‚Äôll let it slide and leave you a comment letting you know haha",t3_dxptnc
