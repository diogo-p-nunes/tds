f73him5,t3_du9qku,"I was gripped from the very first sentence. Very, very well written.

My only complaint is the confusing sudden switch in POV near the end (from 2nd person to 3rd person).",t3_du9qku
f73o1mv,t1_f73him5,"Thanks! The first sentence is framed to be an eyeball grabber, I'm glad it served the purpose. The POV switch intends to create an air of finality and conclusion, like an epilogue, if you may.",t3_du9qku
