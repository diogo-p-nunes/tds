fc3ytg3,t3_eg24o5,"Atleast there's a woman in my life that's always by my side, so that's a plus, although she is ""growing"" inside of me so I'm not sure about that.

Weird jokes aside, good story. Though the premise of """"something"" lingering around you but it actually is depression/other emotion"" has kinda made its' way around, the story is still beautiful and real, since millions of people suffer from it. I suffer from it myself too, so this is relatable, and the best kind of horror is the one that can be real, and you have experienced it before.

Although maybe ""Her"" is not actually depression or emotions, but something else more terrifying. Maybe a parasitic alien being. It's probably just student loan.",t3_eg24o5
fc3vrtl,t3_eg24o5,That was beautiful.,t3_eg24o5
fc4r9s5,t3_eg24o5,"""Do you see her?""

Yes, I do. We are one and the same since I was 12. She's in every thought, in every word, in every breath I take. Because of her, I'm gloomy even when I'm happy. Because of her, I almost left this world twice. But here we are. Me and her. And everyday we fight to see which one of us is the strongest",t3_eg24o5
fc4wf6r,t3_eg24o5,"Forgive my weebness, bht this really reminds me of the  Ayakashi in noragami. Such a cool concept, 10/10",t3_eg24o5
fc6kvac,t3_eg24o5,"I don't see her very often, but I'm well aquainted with her brother rage. He's an asshole.",t3_eg24o5

fc3w0y2,t1_fc3vrtl,Thank you! That means a lot to me!,t3_eg24o5
fcq1xtj,t1_fc4wf6r,Its around the same concept. Basically depression but made into an actual thing. Tho ayakashi has many forms(in noragami).,t3_eg24o5
fc40sgy,t1_fc3z26h,"Yay, thank god it was actually depression, or I would've cursed myself for being dumb!

Good story, keep writing! I'd love to see more!",t3_eg24o5
