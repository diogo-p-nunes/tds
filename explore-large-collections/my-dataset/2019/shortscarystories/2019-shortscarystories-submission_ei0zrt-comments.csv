fcmrc6b,t3_ei0zrt,"Is it beastiality if someone had sexual intercourse with a werewolf in human form?

Semi-beastiality aside, good story. The whole ""he kept his calm"" makes the reader anxious on what is going to happen that'll make him lose it. 

The last few line about the sky humming and calming him is really beautiful and creepy too, since the whole Werewolf shtick can just be prevented by not looking up, but by making the Moon hums and attracting the narrator to look at it is a very good idea, and a very nice way to reveal the twist to us. Nice one.",t3_ei0zrt
