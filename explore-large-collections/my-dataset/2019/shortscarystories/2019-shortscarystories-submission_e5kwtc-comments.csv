f9lbuo6,t3_e5kwtc,"Jesus... At first it makes you chuckle, then you really start thinking about it.

Celebrities in that moment, trapped in their minds, possibly for decades as they live through every single instance.

Kids suddenly assaulted by visions they can't understand, finding out a truth about adults they thought they could trust or complete strangers they never noticed had been watching them.

And all the victims of foot fetishists...

This is truly horrifying!",t3_e5kwtc

f9l0agt,t3_e5kwtc,"Wild concept, beautifully written! I love that it allows for complete moral interpretation based on the reader, rather than forcing a single perspective. Would love more information on the Vision. Did it last longer for some than others? Do you remain aware of every new incident, or is it only a revelation of what has come before?",t3_e5kwtc

f9o9335,t1_f9mfr5x,"That's the implication, though the way it is written leaves it very open to interpretation. Similarly, the implication is that this was a one-time Vision and not an alteration to the status quo but rather a ""gift"" given once and then done. Yet again, completely open to interpretation.

I think the real magic of this piece is not the concept of knowing who looks at you in a sexual manner, but rather the enigma behind the mechanics of where this knowledge came from, how it was done, and why. The invasion of privacy and moral implications are pretty standard. Time dilation, impure thoughts, lasciviousness, secret perversions, these are all concepts we are familiar with and are detailed clearly within the story. But the hidden implications are what really draw the reader in. The questions that arise in the aftermath.",t3_e5kwtc

f9yvuke,t1_f9o9335,"I only really thought of it as a magic realist thing, more interested in the human consequences of the Vision on a wide scale.

For all I care, the agency causing the Vision could be: God, psychic aliens, dimensional turbulence, someone put the silverware back in the wrong drawer, Santa Claus coming to town, etc.",t3_e5kwtc
fa5h132,t1_f9yz0o2,"It's been a while since I watched NGE, so I don't think it was an active influence.
