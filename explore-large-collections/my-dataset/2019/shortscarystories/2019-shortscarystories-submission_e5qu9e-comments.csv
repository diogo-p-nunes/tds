f9lzts3,t3_e5qu9e,"The narrator had a lot of possibilities when he was young. He met a beautiful girl who he ended up marrying. As time flew by, his mother passed away and his wife took away all of his opportunities and ambitions. He tried to end his life, but ultimately failed.",t3_e5qu9e
f9mr4hi,t3_e5qu9e,"This is hands down the best short story I ever read.

I first read the door as a gateway which brings you lots of adventure. Until the bronze key door makes me realise that ""the door"" actually means time. Omg at that point I am overwhelmingly strucked with this realization.

And you know what, rereading it bring more depth each time like peeling the onion into its core. I am reading this at the fourth time and see how you use ""gold key"" to represent the best time of the life, followed by bronze and colourless.

Thanks for this greatness.",t3_e5qu9e
f9lwyix,t3_e5qu9e,"My guess is that the narrator is insane and that’s why her final key reveals a hospital ward.

And the princess becoming more assertive is like a nurse becoming impatient with someone?",t3_e5qu9e

f9t2z7e,t3_e5qu9e,"I love this. Initial conclusion after first read-through = the only way to ""escape"" back to reality away from Princess is to accept reality: the hospital setting leads to their mother, in the same condition as shown by the bronze key",t3_e5qu9e
