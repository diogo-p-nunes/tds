f8ve8ho,t1_f8v33yk,Thanks for your feedback ðŸ™‚ and he couldn't destroy it because he wanted to be normal,t3_e2ci70
f8vkbi1,t1_f8ve8ho,Nah I liked the surprise twist. Giving hints would have just ruined it. The way you wrote it works perfect.,t3_e2ci70
fdokxtc,t1_f8vkbi1,"I second the surprise twist. And I like that you take some chances with your writing. I would look at some of the wording, as it comes across more funny than tense or scary.",t3_e2ci70
f8weh0q,t1_f8vkbi1,Glad you liked it! Comments like yours are what inspires me to keep writing.,t3_e2ci70
