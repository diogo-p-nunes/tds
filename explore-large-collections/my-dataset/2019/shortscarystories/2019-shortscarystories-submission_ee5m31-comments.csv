fbr4nmp,t3_ee5m31,She was teaching you a lesson. Treasure what you have ..but you used and abused them for your own gain. She took them away to be free of you. Dont let this lesson be lost boy. Become a good man and work hard. Earn your hearts desires instead of stealing and cheating and their deaths wont be in vain,t3_ee5m31
fbpzjqz,t3_ee5m31,"No worries about it, Death was just asking them for parental advice, seeing that they are both an amazing parents, and Death jr. is becoming a rebel.

Rebellious teenager aside, sad and scary at the same time. I've felt like this once, where I'm just useless and a burden to my parent, and I still don't think that I deserved my parents, just like the narrator here. No addiction or smoking or stealing though, just a lot of procrastination. I'd fight Death to death if she's trying to take my parent's life. Good story.",t3_ee5m31
