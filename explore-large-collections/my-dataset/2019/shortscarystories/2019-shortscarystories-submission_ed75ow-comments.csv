fbg0vnd,t3_ed75ow,"This is my first story here, so please go easy on me.

I thought of this a few nights ago. I was discussing the 27 Club with my boyfriend and about Robert Johnson being the first 'inducted' into it, along with the legend that he sold his soul to the Devil. My boyfriend made a comment about maybe that's when the Devil collects his dues and it hit me.",t3_ed75ow
fbg8l16,t3_ed75ow,"The Devil Went Down To Georgia to collect Johnny soul when he turns 27.

Song aside, cool and interesting premise. The ending is a bit lackluster though, since the 'Devil always collect his debt."" idea have been spreaded throughout the story a lot. But sometime straightforward ending is good too!",t3_ed75ow
fbgmgv5,t3_ed75ow,"I liked how sure the protagonist was, or how hopeful? that the devil wasn't going to get him, but as he talked about the rest it slowly dawned into him that he was a part of the 27 club. 
Loved it!",t3_ed75ow

fbh7ter,t1_fbh7oi2,"Don't get me wrong though, it's a really good story, especially the buildup towards whether or not the main character will survive or not!",t3_ed75ow
fbh928l,t1_fbh7ter,"It was hard to keep under 500 words near the end too, which is why there wasn't as much buildup. If I ever expand on it I'll try to fix that.",t3_ed75ow
