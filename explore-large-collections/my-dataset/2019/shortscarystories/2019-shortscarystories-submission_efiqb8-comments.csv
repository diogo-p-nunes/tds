fc313f5,t3_efiqb8,"Love the new take on some classic ideas, but your grammar could use a little work",t3_efiqb8
fc3mn6j,t3_efiqb8,Yeah. I have 4 dogs in my house rn and close my door so they can't get in. That would be super creepy.. Love the story though!,t3_efiqb8
fcbr2ag,t3_efiqb8,Good doggy,t3_efiqb8
fc0v1k2,t1_fc0klbg,"Protip: work on your punctuations, it makes your story easier to read.",t3_efiqb8
fc1c493,t1_fc1at8i,"Eh, can't really think about a joke on this one. It's a combination of the old ""humans can lick hands too"" and ""I know you're awake"" story from the old days. Though, the dream parts are pretty spooky, so it's cool.

Though I do have to say, the narrator is going to have a pretty ruff night! Sorry not sorry for the dog pun!",t3_efiqb8
fc3mvxs,t1_fc313f5,Thanks for the tip.,t3_efiqb8

fc0vk5g,t1_fc0v1k2,Ok thank you.,t3_efiqb8
fc1pwqa,t1_fc1c493,"I remember this girl in primary school who for our assessment in our English class, when being told to write a story... she practically wrote that humans lick too story and it was literally the same thing and I'd never heard of it back then. She got praised for her amazing story so much and she even got made to present it in front of the whole school. Then a year or so later I realised that It just wasnt actually her story Idea and it mustve been so awkward for her when she got praised xD (sorry for bad grammar its 2am and i cba)",t3_efiqb8
fc1xju0,t1_fc1pwqa,"Ah, I can feel the awkwardness of presenting a story widely known around the internet and claiming it's yours :p

 Your story reminds me of my own time in school, where people literally copy each other assigment, but forgot to change the name that they're suppose to create. So there's like, 5 assigment with ""RepairTech"" in it, even though each person have to do different names haha.",t3_efiqb8
