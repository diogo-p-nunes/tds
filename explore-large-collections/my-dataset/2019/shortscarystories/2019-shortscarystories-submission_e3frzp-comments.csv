f93fntm,t3_e3frzp,"Wow you excelled at making this suspenseful. Also, fantastic beginning! I love the description of the sun, “fabulously social.” 

Small critique, I too was confused a bit by the ending—I think I might’ve been thrown off because his own “growling and grinding teeth” made me suspect him, and something about the logistics of the creature going from balcony to behind him and then on his desk also confused me, and so there the suspense lost its effect for me. A suggestion, (if he is indeed the victim) maybe the last thing he hears is the ‘drip drip’ of his own blood? (Mauled by creature) 

Anyway great job, it was an excellent read!",t3_e3frzp
f930vex,t3_e3frzp,"This is a great story, but can someone explain the ending please?",t3_e3frzp
f93fqz1,t1_f93fntm,"Thanks for the kind words and the criticism! 

The creature/entity can teleport if you look at your balcony. It always plays this game with its victims.",t3_e3frzp
f931dgu,t1_f930vex,Whatever was standing on the balcony is now standing on his desk.,t3_e3frzp
f981v4p,t1_f931dgu,How was the balcony completely dry then? Wouldn't the thing have left footprints or something?,t3_e3frzp
f981yba,t1_f981v4p,Nope.,t3_e3frzp
