f877llm,t3_dzehhr,Ugh I hate this (but in a good way of course! Really creeps me out),t3_dzehhr
f87ybah,t3_dzehhr,She uses scissors to open presents? That IS scary.,t3_dzehhr

f87nv21,t3_dzehhr,What what’s an abacus,t3_dzehhr
f880asi,t3_dzehhr,So who is going to die then?,t3_dzehhr
f884ck7,t3_dzehhr,"Well, what did you do after that?.. Also did the figure vanish?",t3_dzehhr
f88r6ma,t3_dzehhr,Did you invite the reaper to partake in the festivities or offer a slice of cake by chance?,t3_dzehhr

f88lfxt,t3_dzehhr,Good story and l love the ending.,t3_dzehhr
f87npgn,t1_f877z8i,"Look, when's the last time _you_ saw an abacus? And a well-used one at that? Death just saw it, was all ""holy shit, I love these things"" and had to save face by trying to be scary. And it's hard when everyone's in good heart health and the birthday girl is going to see the 2090s",t3_dzehhr
f87c4r4,t1_f877z8i,"Hmm, you've got a point there.",t3_dzehhr

f8akfdm,t1_f87faec,"How about a cat-Food can? 

I could use the roughage.",t3_dzehhr
f89zs51,t1_f87ybah,Have you ever bought the more expensive shiny kind of wrapping paper? Its super thick and plasticy. It doesn't rip you have to cut it. I bought it one time for christmas years ago and will never buy it again. Every one used scissors since I put too much tape on it like a dummy.,t3_dzehhr
f87r3nc,t1_f87nv21,It's an ancient type of calculator. You know those with the beads on wooden sticks in a frame.,t3_dzehhr

f886gx3,t1_f87npgn,"r/wholesome right here. Seriously, good stuff. I can definitely feel it fitting right in the story’s vibe. And it makes everything a gazillion times better.",t3_dzehhr
f88qopu,t1_f87npgn,"It’s a pretty common kids toy and IKEA sells them for that purpose.

f87vr99,t1_f87ofm5,"No need to be disrespectful . Not everyone knows what it’s called,  let’s not forget there are tons of people who arent native english speakers",t3_dzehhr
f8852bg,t1_f881lbg,but she will live till 80plus years old. so there must be someone on that party who is going to die since the reaper is there....,t3_dzehhr

f88t14z,t1_f886pw7,"Sorry that, some of the best writers leave things to the reader’s imagination...I guess you wouldn’t understand that especially since your story ain’t scary. You just told a story about a girl living to 85, that’s a good thing!",t3_dzehhr
f894dgc,t1_f88db20,Try r/nosleep if you wanna expand on this,t3_dzehhr
