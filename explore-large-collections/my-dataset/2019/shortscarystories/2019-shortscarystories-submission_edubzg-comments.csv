fbl6njv,t3_edubzg,"Death is very kind to let people say goodbye to each other. You'd think he's busy reaping souls, but looks like he had time to create a site. Probably filled it with ads too to get money.

Site aside, I like the story. Mysteriousness and hopelessness and there's no telling who created the site, and no stopping whatever the site predict. Good story.",t3_edubzg

America, Southern Africa, Asia and Australia mainly use periods for decimal separation (and thus logically assumed commas for large number notation), while Europe, Russia, South America and the rest of Africa mainly use the inverse.

fbrbt3l,t1_fbqbun6,"I can't say for sure if you'll like this one or not, but I recently found an anime called ""Inuyashiki"". It's only 11 episodes long, and I feel like it is one of those anime shows that have a perfect mix of natural and supernatural. Its plot goes like this—

>Inuyashiki Ichiro is a middle-aged, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.

>However, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.

>The series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.

At times it becomes really gory, like in one episode the antagonist Hiro goes around a neighborhood, randomly chooses a house, goes in and kills all of the family members in cold blood. It's honestly kinda messed up. Here's the [scene](https://youtu.be/3rMmec_BPUE) if you wanna watch it for yourself.

It might not be as thrilling as Death Note, but it certainly has its gripping moments. I hope this helps!",t3_edubzg

It was not because a few days ago a new site named “dateDeath.org” appeared out of nowhere.

It was not because the site contained a list of names from people all over the world with their Death date.

People were not panicking because the site predicted over 18.757 dates that happened in the following days while the people were carefully observed and seen dating at the moment the site predicted.

People were not panicking because the site was impossible to take down and impossible to track.

People were panicking because 89% of the people shared the same Death date.
