Good story. Abuse type of stories are plentiful, but they are really good at firing up the scare meter, since these kinds of stories happen in real life, a lot. Sad, and at the same time, terrifying. At the time of writing this comment, who knows how many abuse victims are crying, wishing for something to happen, and imagining situations like this, just waiting for themselves to snap? Really good story.",t3_ef7met
