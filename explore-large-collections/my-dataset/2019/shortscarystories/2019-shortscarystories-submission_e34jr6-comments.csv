f90vp54,t3_e34jr6,This is really good! Took me a second read through to fully understand the twist,t3_e34jr6
f91ty9o,t3_e34jr6,"Stories that necessitate a second read are like a two for one bonus. Great job, OP.",t3_e34jr6
f917tt9,t3_e34jr6,I think this is one of the best short stories I have ever read. So creative and surprising. Thank you for making me have to reread every word over again immediately when I'd finished. I wanted to. What a great idea and clear clean execution. Standing O.,t3_e34jr6
f918769,t3_e34jr6,"Creepy, a great unexpected twist, well written. This is the POINT of this subreddit. Thank you for sharing!",t3_e34jr6
f90rdln,t3_e34jr6,"On mobile, sorry for any typos.",t3_e34jr6
f91tovc,t3_e34jr6,"""Would have killed for some turkey"" nice foreshadowing!",t3_e34jr6
f914o00,t3_e34jr6,terrifying,t3_e34jr6
f920wro,t3_e34jr6,"Omg for a second I thought Mike ate a dog thigh, I‚Äôm so relieved !

I hope they didn‚Äôt put Tom down :(",t3_e34jr6
f91fprs,t3_e34jr6,Looks like Tom does a heckin' good job when it comes to survival. Other doggo is suprised. Either way both good boys with a rare taste of human flesshies. It did me a frighten. 13/10.,t3_e34jr6
f91erzl,t3_e34jr6,Wow. Loved it,t3_e34jr6
f91jzfc,t3_e34jr6,"Short, but sweet!",t3_e34jr6
f91l1wf,t3_e34jr6,Brilliant twist! Nicely done.,t3_e34jr6
f9231yo,t3_e34jr6,"Very good story. This is the kind of content that got me hooked on shortscarystories in the first place.

Nicely done!",t3_e34jr6
f91fvy5,t3_e34jr6,Bruh this is good,t3_e34jr6
f91rvgo,t3_e34jr6,Took a second read for me too!  Chilling,t3_e34jr6
f91wyfe,t3_e34jr6,Wow. This is nothing like any story I've read here. I had to read it again to grasp it fully. Well done!,t3_e34jr6
f92f9x0,t3_e34jr6,Bad doggo,t3_e34jr6
f94eh9z,t3_e34jr6,"I got a hint of it when you mentioned Kate was the one that fed them, but overall unexpected! Good job!",t3_e34jr6
f91nhe2,t3_e34jr6,"Great read! 

If I may, though, two critiques:  


1) How would a dog know what a phone is? and 

2) You give the game away too early IMO. Short story twists tend to function better in the last line or two, which you already accomplished with your line from the EMT. If you cut the obvious references to the narrator being a dog, I think the twist would hit harder, which also ties this back to point 1. 

Like I said, great read. I look forward to more submissions!",t3_e34jr6
f92a9u1,t3_e34jr6,"Took a while to click, but damn that's a great twist! Thank you for sharing!",t3_e34jr6
f92gltv,t3_e34jr6,The thing I can't get over is the constant switching between past and present tense. Major pet peeve,t3_e34jr6
f925h8a,t3_e34jr6,Incredible!,t3_e34jr6
f926b2p,t3_e34jr6,Refreshingly unexpected! Nice job!,t3_e34jr6
f927s10,t3_e34jr6,What a treat!  Great twist and great change in perspective!,t3_e34jr6

f93khgm,t3_e34jr6,"i was confused at first, read it again. The line where he has the red on his gold coat really put it all together, i loved it",t3_e34jr6
f93wpi4,t3_e34jr6,"This is one of the best stories I‚Äôve read in awhile. Fairly new to this sub but so glad I found it. Great job, OP. Hope to see more from you.",t3_e34jr6
f94qs0e,t3_e34jr6,"henlo kate, i and my fren Tom doin a heckin eat",t3_e34jr6
f953d0c,t3_e34jr6,"I realised the twist as soon as it said ""fed us breakfast"". That kinda gave it away for me. Also, it says ""and leaving us with Tom."", shouldn't it be Mike?

Regardless, I really enjoyed the story and it's overall well done! :)",t3_e34jr6
f9plees,t3_e34jr6,"This was awesome! Loved the twist, and I genuinely didn't see it coming! Great job. Especially with such a short story!",t3_e34jr6

f91i4g8,t1_f91hxrf,"Mike and his wife had a fight, she leaves, their dogs start eating him RIP.",t3_e34jr6
f91u9tr,t1_f91rx99,I was trying to imply the human choked to death when his wife stormed off. Thanks for reading!,t3_e34jr6
f95tko9,t1_f951d9v,"Tom and the narrator are dogs, Mike has a fight with his wife and she leaves. He chokes on a bone and the dogs eat him. Now they‚Äôre hungry!",t3_e34jr6
fb5qm2c,t1_fb5memz,Thank you!,t3_e34jr6
f92c16r,t1_f91u74k,"I thought it was great üòÅ! The only thing I would change is to delete ‚Äúmy tail wagging‚Äù, as then it leaves the twist right to the very end, rather than almost the very end.

More please!",t3_e34jr6
f91vggh,t1_f91u74k,"Well, keep it up. You‚Äôre good at it. That being said don‚Äôt take to heart too much the eventual hard boiled critique except what you can gain from it.",t3_e34jr6
f92z4vw,t1_f91u7rh,Love it. However my dog didn‚Äôt. :)   And this is why you feed your pets. Love the twist.,t3_e34jr6
f93d1gp,t1_f93c882,r/todayilearned. Poor doggos :(,t3_e34jr6
f93wuvo,t1_f93c882,I was thinking the same thing. So unfair since it‚Äôs the owners fault for not feeding them. Poor doggos.,t3_e34jr6
f91v0d1,t1_f91rtxd,I see Sollux‚Äôs first point though  [certain pooches](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog/comments/dugwzd/bruh_sometimes_i_just_catch_him_chillin_and/) outright undercut what some of us might consider an unintelligent good boy consensus. His second point I addressed in my other comment though I still think this is one of this sub‚Äôs best earned reveals in a while.,t3_e34jr6
f931x7r,t1_f91rtxd,"I know that feeling. As writers, it's sometimes hard to gauge what an audience is capable of interpreting from the work, but most readers are quite perceptive about that sort of stuff.",t3_e34jr6
f93cfxg,t1_f91rtxd,"I disagree with the above commenter. I didn't get the twist until the end and I re-read it with a cackle of understandings. Great reveal, don't change a thing.",t3_e34jr6

Thank you!",t3_e34jr6
f91z4lc,t1_f91u9tr,Ahhh ok,t3_e34jr6
f94wo7n,t1_f93wuvo,Or it's noones fault that the owner died and was a dog owner. That was my first thought.,t3_e34jr6
f931s3e,t1_f91v0d1,"Oh yeah, I didn't mean to imply dogs are dumb. My GF's Border Collie is insanely smart. It just seems a little weird to have it know the appliance by name.",t3_e34jr6
f91jdnw,t1_f91j2cf,Of course! Thank you for reading.,t3_e34jr6
f95qahd,t1_f94wo7n,"That‚Äôs true but I feel like a dog would only eat the owner if it was really starving, which means it wasn‚Äôt being fed enough. I could be wrong though.",t3_e34jr6
f93h7cu,t1_f931s3e,I got what you meant. I just like to think that dogs are absurdly intelligent despite all evidence to the contrary lol.,t3_e34jr6
