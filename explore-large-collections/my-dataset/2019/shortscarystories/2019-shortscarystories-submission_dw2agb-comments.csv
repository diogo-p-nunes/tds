f7m0nf9,t1_f7gemo1,"At least she didn't friendzone him. It's one thing to say ""I love you. And then the friendship suddenly dies right then and there. Being weak or strong with the gay-dar is one thing, risking a life long friendship by saying ""I love you"" is another thing. You could fuck up something good with that.",t3_dw2agb
f7hlpb3,t1_f7gl6ex,Thanks!  I was wondering why that was so but decided to go with it.  My first time posting here.,t3_dw2agb
