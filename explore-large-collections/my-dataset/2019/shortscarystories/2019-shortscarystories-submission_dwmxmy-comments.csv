f7kvakc,t3_dwmxmy,I can read the Korean and I’m still hella confused.,t3_dwmxmy
f7kw5ye,t3_dwmxmy,"Anyone want to find those coordinate points for me?

f7mt57b,t1_f7kvakc,"Could you correct my grammar? I used Google translate sorry! 

Every night a man is forcibly teleported to a random location on earth by unknown means. He does his best to survive in each place never knowing where he will end up tomorrow. In the last entry in his journal he writes the GPS coordinates for a nuclear testing site in North Korea. The Korean at the top should have explained that the man was shot, they found his journal but his body vanished at midnight. The implication being that despite being dead his body would never cease endlessly jumping all over the world.

My idea was ok but I think I messed up the execution.",t3_dwmxmy
f7n5ysu,t1_f7mt57b,"first sentence's rather ambiguous. problemic part is '경찰을 타는'. which means 'while riding a policeman'. so.. a foreign spy who rides a policeman has been shot? it's hard to guess what you really meant.

'시체는 자정에 사라지는' is supposed to be a comeplete sentence. but it's more like 'the body that disappears in midnight.' so you better change it into '시체는 자정에 사라졌다.'

'일기를 찾았습니다' is active form. so it means '(we, or with context north koreans) found a journal'. but... i don't know. isn't it more natural 'a journal was found?' in this case proper sentence would be '일기가 발견되었다'",t3_dwmxmy
f7n9wue,t1_f7n5ysu,"Wow! Thanks so much! 
In the first sentence I wanted to say, ""A foreign spy was shot climbing the fence."" I don't know how it became policeman Lol.
I'm more familiar with Japanese (currently studying for N3) so I understand how hard it is to learn a another language. Much respect and appreciation to you!",t3_dwmxmy
f7nb2dm,t1_f7n9wue,"in that case proper sentence would be '철책을 기어오르던 외국 스파이를 사살했다'

it's an active form. i guess first paragraph is north koreans saying their daily report or something. if you want to maintain passive form '철책을 기어오르던 외국 스파이가 사살되었다' would suit.

glad to be help. hope meet another time in this subreddit with more interesting story.",t3_dwmxmy
