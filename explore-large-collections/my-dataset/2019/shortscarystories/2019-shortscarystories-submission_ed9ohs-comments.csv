fbhjkvr,t3_ed9ohs,I remember I was a little kid watching tv shows at night. The channel was on WB. Around 2 or 3 am the channel play a new show about ghost story. I’m thinking to myself why they broadcast a ghost story tv show late at night. The screen flash to a ghastly woman just staring at a mirror and she was looking at me.  I freak out and turn off the tv. Went straight to sleep. I tried to search for the show. It never exist.,t3_ed9ohs
