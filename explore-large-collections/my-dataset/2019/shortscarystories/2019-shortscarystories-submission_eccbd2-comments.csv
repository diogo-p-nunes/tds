fbftj56,t3_eccbd2,"Well, if she didn't like it ... out ... there, then why did she go there to make out with Jeffrey? It would seem that she placed herself needlessly in danger and did not properly warned her companion. 
Then, when the shit hit the fan, (or should I say the front seat) she just abandoned old blue balled Jeffery. 
Yes, she suggested they go, but when had she done so, while they were still in relative safety? Hell no, she had this ephipheny much too late to be of any real use, at least to Jeffery. Hell, she'd sounded off practically during the final moments (and bowel movement) of Jeffery's all too short, pathetic, sexually frustrated life. 
I'm very disappointed in Stacy and her lack of sensible precaution.

That said, good read and spooky as hell.",t3_eccbd2
