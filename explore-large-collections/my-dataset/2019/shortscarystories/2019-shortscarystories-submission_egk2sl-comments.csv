fc7i0u1,t3_egk2sl,"I can't imagine the terror felt by people who suffer from schizophrenia or some other delusional illness. Nothing worse than feeling like the entire world's gone mad, but you're being treated like the crazy one.",t3_egk2sl
fc732n0,t3_egk2sl,"I haven't written anything since my creative writing class in college, going on about 5 years or so ago. Please feel free to critique me. This just happened to come to me when my own loofah felt weird and I decided to give this a go :)",t3_egk2sl
fc7a6a4,t3_egk2sl,Good story,t3_egk2sl
fcayg0m,t3_egk2sl,"This is about Alzheimer’s, right? Right.",t3_egk2sl
fc8lgon,t3_egk2sl,"Very cool. I hope nobody takes offense to this, but I love a lot of these short stories because they remind me of tales from the crypt, and others like it.",t3_egk2sl
fc7jjqe,t3_egk2sl,"I could make some awesome jokes about genital from the title alone, but I'm a mature man.

Jokes aside, good story. The story itself could portrays someone with mental illness, seeing everything changing around them, yet no one would believe what they're saying, and would rather put the person in hospital than listening to him. Reading this makes me wonder, how horrifying is it if you see something change right in front of your eyes, but nobody will believe you? Nice story, left me satisfied.",t3_egk2sl
fcb841m,t3_egk2sl,"I gotta admit, this one was horrifying good.

Also I need to get more tissues.",t3_egk2sl
fccw3zj,t3_egk2sl,One of my biggest fears is losing my mind. Very scary idea.,t3_egk2sl
fc8yb93,t1_fc7i0u1,One of my biggest fears,t3_egk2sl
fc74f37,t1_fc732n0,Edit- wording.,t3_egk2sl
fc7akhq,t1_fc7a6a4,Thanks! I really whipped this up as I was going with no real plan in place so I’m feeling ok with how it turned out!,t3_egk2sl
fcs79m6,t1_fcayg0m,I was more thinking it was about maybe a form of schizophrenia or maybe these changes were actually happening and it wasn't all in their head! I think you can maybe apply this to Alzheimer's as well! Take it as you wish.,t3_egk2sl
fc8xyy7,t1_fc8lgon,Maybe that’s where it subconsciously came from because I definitely watched a lot of that as a child lol. I want to check that back out actually.,t3_egk2sl
fc8y3n0,t1_fc7jjqe,Thanks! I was kind of going back and forth of is it a mental illness or is everything actually changing? Either way I still don’t know and letting everyone take it as they want to,t3_egk2sl
fc7n4j3,t1_fc74f37,How’s you get loofa from wording? Lol either way it’s an incredible story. Great job!,t3_egk2sl
fc9utm9,t1_fc8xyy7,"It was also a comic. I used to have a bunch as a kid. Re-prints, but I loved the stories.",t3_egk2sl
fc8ydyc,t1_fc7n4j3,"Honestly idk what I’m doing ever on this site, but thank you! Definitely am rusty but looking forward to getting back into the swing of things.",t3_egk2sl
