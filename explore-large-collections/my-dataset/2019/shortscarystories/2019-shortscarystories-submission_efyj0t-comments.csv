fc3719x,t3_efyj0t,This story is based on my childhood of abuse. The incident with the mother and my brother actually happened.,t3_efyj0t
fc3a99b,t3_efyj0t,"Huh.

Huh aside, sad and horrifying story. Abuse happen in real life sadly, and reading the comment and seeing you're a victim of abuse makes the story more realistic and scary. I hope you're doing okay now OP, and are having a good day. A good story, one that makes the reader feel emotional and scared. Good one.",t3_efyj0t
fc3z20t,t3_efyj0t,I am so sorry this happened to you. It was never your fault.,t3_efyj0t
fc4bclk,t3_efyj0t,It makes me so angry that someone could do that to their own child. You are never to blame.,t3_efyj0t
fc4adba,t3_efyj0t,Tears. I’m sorry you had to grow up like this and hope you’re in a better place now.,t3_efyj0t
fc7cyow,t3_efyj0t,"OP, I am sorry for what you went though. Based off your replies to others, I know you are doing much better and I am so happy for that. How are your siblings?",t3_efyj0t
fc4qvey,t3_efyj0t,"I'm really sorry you had to go through this, OP. No child should ever be abused, this makes my blood boil. I hope you're doing well in life and I wish you all the happiness in this world. Best wishes!",t3_efyj0t
fc4hn2x,t3_efyj0t,"Tbh I can't say I liked this story, because I'm not a big fan of child abuse being used as a horror story device. It was well-written, though.",t3_efyj0t
fc4bxef,t3_efyj0t,r/nosleep,t3_efyj0t
fc4rxp2,t3_efyj0t,"So glad you are in a better place! It can help sometimes to write about these things and I appreciate your bravery. Good job getting out of there. I hope you enjoyed your holidays - negativity free! These can be the toughest times, because if you're like me, you find yourself missing the family you wish you had growing up, even though you are much better off without them and the abuse now. Sending lots of love!",t3_efyj0t
fc6flxu,t3_efyj0t,This is heartbreaking.,t3_efyj0t
fca3iyb,t3_efyj0t,Please add this to r/sad.,t3_efyj0t
fc3ekbq,t1_fc3719x,"That is terrible. I’m so sorry.


Written beautifully, however.",t3_efyj0t
fc4jim0,t1_fc3719x,"I am so sorry. 

As a kid, I have taken quite a few beatings with spatulas made of steel (sometimes they were hot), and brooms and slippers. 
This is fairly normal in my country, to discipline the child and is done out of love. I once went to school with a black eye because my mother had hit me over the most stupid reason 
Point is, this is so normalized in my culture that I kinda felt meh over the story and immediately was consumed by guilt. 

I do hope you're in a better position now op!",t3_efyj0t
fc470om,t1_fc3719x,Sounds like my late mom’s life. I’m sorry that you had a life like that,t3_efyj0t
fc3amqv,t1_fc3a99b,I’m in a much better place now. Glad you enjoyed!,t3_efyj0t
fc4bgpi,t1_fc3z20t,"Thank you for the kind words, it means a lot.",t3_efyj0t
fc4bg1f,t1_fc4bclk,"I agree, took me a while to realize that though!",t3_efyj0t
fc4bhh4,t1_fc4adba,"A much better place, thanks for the kind words!",t3_efyj0t
fc7d0kk,t1_fc7cyow,"Sadly I was kicked out a year and a half ago, but my siblings still live with my parents, so I don’t know how they are",t3_efyj0t
fc57iib,t1_fc4jim0,"Oh no. Abuse is never done out of love, and those who insist it is to justify the abuse they inflict upon others tend not to understand the meaning of the word, which stands to reason that they are inherently incapable of truly giving or feeling real love, especially toward their victims. They don’t deserve excuses, pity or acceptance. People who psychologically devastate the children they have a responsibility to protect are absolute fucking monsters. It’s not you who should feel guilty for believing the abusive parts of your childhood were normal.",t3_efyj0t
fc4jm0i,t1_fc4jim0,"Much better position, hope you’re doing okay as well!",t3_efyj0t
fc7d48c,t1_fc7d0kk,It’s unfortunate you don’t know how they are. I’m really sorry for what you have all endured. Have you tried contacting them?,t3_efyj0t
fc7d5nu,t1_fc7d48c,"I have, but to no success",t3_efyj0t
fc7db09,t1_fc7d5nu,"I hope they are OK. If you’re able, please keep us updated. Kudos to you for having the strength to share your story. Keep your head up, OP! You’ve got this.",t3_efyj0t
fcguj0q,t1_fc7d5nu,Have you tried calling social services on them? (Or whatever it's called where you live) Get your siblings into foster care.,t3_efyj0t
