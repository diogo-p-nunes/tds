fajm7fy,t3_e9d9sf,"Hum, a little grammatical mistakes, the idea is good. But you need to split this into multiple paragraphs. And I would recommend using this→ ' instead of these→ ‘’, they makes the story a little hard to read. The build-up of the story needs improvement, and a more detailed description of the dream might help. Make the first part longer, make the readers anticipate for what is to come, make them tense and waiting for it, then strike and bring down all those built-up emotions.",t3_e9d9sf
