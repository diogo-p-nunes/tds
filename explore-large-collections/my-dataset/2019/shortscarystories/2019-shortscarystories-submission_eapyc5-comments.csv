fb4zbj8,t3_eapyc5,"This concept is fantastic! And this is truly a great story. The transition was a little confusing though. I'm only trying to be helpful, so take it or leave it, but here's what I see.

It wasn't clear that you were feeling something unusual since it's all been auditory before this. Maybe ""I stop spinning. I feel something, electric? Like licking a nine-volt."" would resolve that.

The part about base being a few yards away was also difficult to figure out what feeling you were trying to convey. I'm still not sure. Maybe something about stealing base would be better? Were you trying to get at a guilty/watched feeling?

The back that was facing you, where did that come from? Is that real life or your vision? Same for the branch and leaves, and black hand. They come out of nowhere and distract rather than add.
Did that come from having to cut words out of a longer version?

The rest works great, when you call it a returning feeling and repressed memory that solidifies the ending. I really did like your story. You have some really great descriptions mixed throughout. The nine-volt, the ripe peach, the frustration with automated lines. Great word choice. 

Please reply because I want to know the answers to what some of those things meant.",t3_eapyc5

fb560o5,t1_fb4zbj8,"Have you ever played hide and seek? When your so close to base but the person that’s  “it” is just a breath away. Only to make a noise and he comes for you. The dread of being caught red-handed kind of thing. I see left a a few chunks out. I probably left out em to meet the 500 word limit, then forgot to fix em.

Also seen I forgot to leave out a few words here and there, which I can see why it’s a little jarring. 

But thank you so much for the detailed comment. I’m glad you liked it.",t3_eapyc5
