fc8yyoq,t3_egr38b,"I'm going to contact the police because of the exact description of me on the first few paragraph.

My anger issues aside, spooky story. The twist of him being the evil one is predictable, though that Great Depression twist has some clue scattered around. I really like the idea of contacting a spirit, but instead of the present, you're spirit-calling him from the past. Also I like the idea of someone getting so pissed that they become Scorpion and shoots fireball from their mouth. Nice one Bakn.",t3_egr38b
fc9cvu9,t3_egr38b,"Oddly, and in spite of the year, I did not take this as a reference to the Great Depression of the 1930s. The word ""depression"" was not capitalized in the last sentence, therefore I took it as a mental illness depression which would be the cause of his murdering his family the next day. I see this story from inside the deep well of depression. I don't know what your intent was but grammar does matter , but in spite of that, it works both ways.",t3_egr38b

fc93n71,t1_fc8yyoq,"Nice! I had a bit of inspiration this morning for that section!

This concept is a well traveled road in literature and movies. I tried to put my touches on it without re-inventing the wheel. 

I had a lot of fun writing it! I never thought about Scorpion... maybe my next ghost can freeze them like Sub Zero!!",t3_egr38b
fc9fd6b,t1_fc9cvu9,"Very insightful! I ""hopefully"" am coming out of another bout with depression myself. Thank you sharing your insight! I hope that you're able to see some experiences as positive and that this is one of them. I hated it when people would tell me lines like that so I'm sorry if it came off wrong.

 It was a play on the word as the formal noun and the medical condition as it fit, like you picked up. 

I also considered when they would have referred to it as a formal noun, 1952 from what I could tell in quick research. Because he thinks he's alive still and thinks it's 1931, he wouldn't know the formal name for the historical period yet. Similar to a WWI character, he wouldn't refer to the war as WWI.",t3_egr38b
fcb84cq,t1_fcb4xok,Thank you! Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_egr38b
fciw8jw,t1_fc9fd6b,"That was really very thorough and insightful of you. Details like that definitely can make or break a story. Maybe not every story, but they can definitely take you out of the story if it has you really engrossed. I didn't see the Depression era setting coming. I thought only of fairly modern times with unemployment and such. I too guessed ""The Others""  style mock twist as in they were the ghosts all along but the real twist being the future dictating the past and the Great Depression era setting made for a better story. More original. Great job on a great story.",t3_egr38b
fcizgmr,t1_fciw8jw,"Thank you! Appreciate the feedback! 

I debated about using more period appropriate language in the dialogue, but tried to stay vague enough to apply to each timeline.

The question I wanted to leave the reader with  is “How many times have the current timeline occupants had a seance asking the question that dictates the outcome?”",t3_egr38b
fcjag47,t1_fcizgmr,That is such an original thought. I like when an author can make me ponder a question ive never thought to ask. And I don't get that very often in no way is this a brag on myself I just have a very active imagination and I wonder so many things and ask questions others rarely or never do. So this was that much more enjoyment for me. Im new to Reddit trying to figure out how things work so I'm not sure how to find other posts or follow.  you. Have you written other stories or do you plan to?  If so how do I find them? If you don't mind answering no offense if you don't. Lol,t3_egr38b
fcjtzmg,t1_fcjag47,"Thank you, I take that as a great compliment!

I'm new here as well. No offence at all, I consider it an honor that you would like to see my other stories. The easiest way I've found to see what someone else has written is to click their username on their posts or comments. u/aye8Bakn should work as well. There is a follow button when on their/my profile page. There may be a more efficient way, but I haven't found it yet.

I hadn't wrote creatively for many years. I recently just picked it up as a hobby. Hope you enjoy some of the other stories. I'm always open to feedback!",t3_egr38b
fck3wyb,t1_fcjtzmg,Great. Thank you!,t3_egr38b
