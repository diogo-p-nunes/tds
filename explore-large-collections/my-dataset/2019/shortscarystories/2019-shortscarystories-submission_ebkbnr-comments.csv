fb6qij2,t3_ebkbnr,"This is absolutely brilliant. The concept here is *gold* dude. I could see it being some sort of dark comedy, in which the main character reluctantly fights an angelic war while dealing with other recently deceased draftees who are noticebaly irked after dying prematurely. Maybe one had a band that was about to get signed, then his drummer accidentally ran him over with their van. Maybe another was finally getting laid at the age of 24 and had an aneurism in the middle of foreplay.",t3_ebkbnr

fdufe4i,t1_fctgxnr,"The man was hit by a truck and died, ending up in heaven. But he quickly realizes the angel sent the truck to kill him so he could help fight Hell.",t3_ebkbnr
