fc1clgg,t3_efmmgs,"I'm sorry, I can't help laughing as I imagine a little boy spinning as fast as the Earth spins while Grandma Gracie is trying her best to keep up with the spinning.

That imagination aside, cool story. It's sweet, since his grandma became a zombie just to entertain him, but scary at the same because his grandma became a zombie. I think this story could very well be about how grief can damage someone's mind, especially a 12 yo like Archie here. A terrifying thought, being young and having to face with tremendous grief. Nice one.",t3_efmmgs
