f9kqavj,t3_e54khe,"Poor Carl. I thought he got lured into a child trafficking ring for a moment, but this is also a terrible outcome for him. The child doesn’t seem to want to kill, however. I hope his conscience winds up saving Carl.",t3_e54khe
f9lcraa,t1_f9kqavj,Thanks for the read. I wanted to make things a tab ambiguous. Hope you liked it.,t3_e54khe
f9lcwud,t1_f9lcraa,"You're welcome! <3 I did enjoy reading it. I binged on a whole bunch of posts on this sub as my classes concluded, which kept the wait interesting~",t3_e54khe
f9lddoc,t1_f9lcwud,"Yeah - perfect for a quick shiver, isn't it?  (the sub - not the story)

You have to kiss a lot of frogs, but there are some real gems here.  And there's a book, too - profits to charity: Horror D'oeuvres. On Amazon.  Please check it out.  Three volumes now. 

You can get all Kindle-y, or buy an actual meatspace book that you can hold in your hands.",t3_e54khe
f9lemp2,t1_f9lddoc,"Pfft, it was far from quick. I was at it for three hours, with no regrets. XD 

I love all things horror-related, but I cannot buy that book, I'm afraid. I spent way too much money enough as it is this semester on alcohol and clothes.. For what it's worth, I do have the rest of an H.P. Lovecraft anthology waiting for me to finish. <3 So, I'll take that chance.",t3_e54khe
f9lf3j4,t1_f9lemp2,"Good luck with school and all. Luckily, there's lots of good free content on r/ShortScaryStories to fill your nights with terror. 

I have also found that the more alcohol you have the less you need clothes.",t3_e54khe
f9lgy53,t1_f9lf3j4,"Before I reply to that, how old are you? XD",t3_e54khe
f9lhcy1,t1_f9lgy53,"Old enough to know better :) Let's leave it there

(52, btw) :)",t3_e54khe
f9lhmt4,t1_f9lhcy1,"I see. Well, in that case, thank you--and I slightly agree. XD I like a good bathrobe, Winter or Summer.",t3_e54khe
f9lhrr4,t1_f9lhmt4,Let's not forget the fuzzy slippers and a slightly warm glass of Courvoisier.  Hopefully with a nice fire.,t3_e54khe
f9lhwi5,t1_f9lhrr4,"My Dad likes that stuff~ You’re about his age, actually. XD I just turned 23, and I am trying to try as much as possible while I can. So far, I seem to be a whiskey-gal. I prefer to go barefoot, but the fire sounds nice regardless. <3",t3_e54khe
f9lihdj,t1_f9lhwi5,"Well - enjoy life and try no to be too serious. That sounds like it is not a problem. :) 

Bourbon is my mainstay - I don't know why, but a whisky-swilling-woman always gets a few extra cool points, all other things being equal.",t3_e54khe
f9lk8h5,t1_f9lihdj,"Bourbon is also nice. <3 Basic wine and vodka are pretty high up there as well, which peg them as my usuals for the time being. 

As of now, I must be going to bed. I hope to send you a message sometime, if we can discuss more drinks and horror~ Or horror over drinks.",t3_e54khe
f9lkgac,t1_f9lk8h5,Have a good evening.  Nice talking with you and enjoy the horror you find.,t3_e54khe
f9lks01,t1_f9lkgac,I hope you have a nice evening as well~ And I probably will. n.n,t3_e54khe
