fbeacc0,t3_ecxi46,"To anyone who might be offended >!the mom never killed the fiancee and his ex was still living. His mom is mentally ill. She ruins every relationship that he has by telling them all of his perversions, bad stories, etc. He copes by stuffing dolls of his exes to try to keep the love alive and not feel alone, but he never quite gets it right. Each time he falls in love, he knows it's inevitable that it will be ruined, but each time he stays hopeful that he might be able to make the next doll realistic enough that it will replace a living human. Sorry also if you clicked and this ruined the necrophiliac vibe of the original story.!<",t3_ecxi46
fbegl4e,t3_ecxi46,"Damn taxidermy shop feeding into people fetishes.

Fetish asides, I was really getting tired of necrophilia stories, but reading the comment really gives new look towards the story. Good one.",t3_ecxi46
fbgp235,t3_ecxi46,Very Norman Bates. I like it.,t3_ecxi46
fbfh2ut,t1_fbeacc0,"The real mystery is why somebody would take a sharppie and censor your comment like it appears someone has. It makes no sense, if you reply the text becomes readable also if you copy to your clipboard the text is readable. They have censored nothing! Viva la revolucion!",t3_ecxi46
fbehu8c,t1_fbegl4e,"You can find anything online if you look hard enough!

Maybe that’s the real scary story... what ones brain assumes vs the reality. I didn’t want to offend any victims of necrophilia!

Thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed it!",t3_ecxi46

fbfhr3a,t1_fbfh2ut,It’s a spoiler tag. Click the block to show the text. You can set it up using the spoiler block below the post on desktop or by bracket of less than exclamation point on mobile. Just learned it today. That way if some didn’t want the less offensive version they could keep the imagery from the original in their head.,t3_ecxi46
fbeichs,t1_fbehu8c,"Wouldn't call them victims, since if they were a victim of necrophilia, they'd be dead enough to not be offended.

Jokes aside, yeah, story that have a bit of reality sprinkled within them is scary and horrifying. Hope you'll keep writing stories!",t3_ecxi46
fbeimlp,t1_fbeichs,"You... you still think you’re alive... I’m sorry...

Jokes aside also. Thank you again! Agreed on the reality bits making the story better. I plan on it!",t3_ecxi46
