f7lge10,t3_dwt2iq,I really feel like you should expand on this and turn it into an SCP. This would fit in quite well. Very well done.,t3_dwt2iq

f7nc61z,t3_dwt2iq,"Plot twist: the Mexican labs get a step wrong and the new drug makes everyone empathetic and kind. Nobody buys it. 

Slight nitpick: As a former lab rat, for initial human trials they keep you sequestered in a lab dorm and closely monitored so that you can’t just pocket the doses like that one dude in the story did. In one trial, I was given a pill and then they shined a flashlight in my mouth to make sure I had actually swallowed it and wasn’t hiding it under my tongue.",t3_dwt2iq
