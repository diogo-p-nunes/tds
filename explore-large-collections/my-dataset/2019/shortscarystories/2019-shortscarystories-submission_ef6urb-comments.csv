fbyvgch,t3_ef6urb,"I'm driving home for Christmas  
Oh, I think I can see faces  
I'm driving home for Christmas, yea  
I ain't moving down the line

And it's been so long  
But I will get there  
I sing this song  
To pass the time away  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time  
But I'll get there  
Top to toe in snow flakes  
Oh, I see faces in the snow  
But soon there'll be a freeway yeah  
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get through  
And feel you near me  
Driving in my car  
I'm driving home for Christmas  
Driving home for Christmas  
With a twisted memory

I take look out the window next to me  
It's just the same  
Still the same

Top to toe in snow flakes  
Oh, whiteness all around  
I'm driving home for Christmas, yea  
Think I need some holy ground

So I scream for you  
Though you can't hear me  
When I get through  
Oh I feel them near me  
Driving in my car  
Driving home for Christmas  
Driving home for Christmas  
With no more memories

I take look out the window next to me  
The scenery is still the same  
I ain't driving home, driving home  
Driving home for Christmas
