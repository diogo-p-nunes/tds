fbo8lym,t3_ee2r7o,"Pet Sematery except TinTin is the goodest of boy.

Good boy aside, the story feels more sad than scary. But I like it, especially the part with the weird texture. You'd think that ""oh no, it's not Tintin, it's a monster!"" but no, it really is Tintin, just dead and covered in dirt. Cool one.",t3_ee2r7o
fbqfr32,t3_ee2r7o,I‚Äôd give anything to have one last night of cuddles with my baby girl.,t3_ee2r7o
fbpphk0,t3_ee2r7o,Why would you leave the good boy? He was resurrected for you,t3_ee2r7o
fbqps8c,t3_ee2r7o,I thought this was a rip-off of the ‚ÄúPeople kick too‚Äù creepypasta but this was very unexpected and original! Nice work op,t3_ee2r7o
fbt9zn2,t3_ee2r7o,"My heart is broken... üíî I lost my good girl this past July, just after my birthday. She was my best friend, my daughter and my therapy pup. She was only 3. Every day I go back and forth with whether or not I believe she's gone, and even after convincing myself that she is, in fact, gone, I can't help wishing and hoping I'll hear her scamper into my room, even if I could bring it about myself by ""less acceptable"" means.
Take my upvote, Sir, and do as you will with it.",t3_ee2r7o
fbqy1sa,t3_ee2r7o,"This reminds me of a story my mom used to tell me. It was my favorite of hers so this brought back a lot of old memories. This is so cute and sad, so good job OP. I'll never understand why he left his good boy though.",t3_ee2r7o
fbs4xmk,t3_ee2r7o,I thought it was gonna be a person......or a demon......but nope....a ghost dog.....yay.....,t3_ee2r7o
fbqyj56,t3_ee2r7o,"I enjoyed it, and I don't want to be one of those guys, but try not to start most of the sentences with ""I did this, I did that, then I did this.""",t3_ee2r7o

fbtb15m,t1_fbo8lym,"Damn you are really trying to get that karma bro I've seen you comment on literally every single story that was posted within the last 24 with similar sounding comments ""----, ----- aside (insert comment regarding the story)"" not hating on you, just an observation",t3_ee2r7o
fbpxnig,t1_fbpphk0,I love my dogs more than I love myself (including ones that have passed) but if they came out of the ground I'd do my best to put them back.,t3_ee2r7o
