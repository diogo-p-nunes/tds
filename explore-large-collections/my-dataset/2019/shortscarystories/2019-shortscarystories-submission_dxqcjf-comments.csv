f7urgis,t3_dxqcjf,This was really great. Wow. Short but sweet. Well written. Knew exactly what was going on and could picture it in my mindâ€™s eye. Well done.,t3_dxqcjf
f7uke0n,t3_dxqcjf,First time writing in a while. Any and all feedback appreciated.,t3_dxqcjf
f7w3b6x,t3_dxqcjf,"Great story. But all Ryan and the cheating wife has to do is tell the police the truth, that is if the woman doesnt want Ryan to go to prison.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wn46m,t3_dxqcjf,"Very nice. I was expecting Will to shoot his wife, blaming it on Ryan.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wj7si,t3_dxqcjf,"OK, this is going to be biased because I'm your dad 'n stuff, but that was pretty awesome.",t3_dxqcjf
f7xndkj,t3_dxqcjf,Does William have three hands?,t3_dxqcjf
f7v2y7a,t3_dxqcjf,Very well done ðŸ‘Œ,t3_dxqcjf
f7wokia,t3_dxqcjf,Not where I thought it would go.,t3_dxqcjf
f7wtnx4,t3_dxqcjf,"Excellent. Really enjoyed the ending, it tells us a lot about the character without really using that many words. Wonderfully dark",t3_dxqcjf
f7wrkuz,t3_dxqcjf,"It felt really rushed, it was kind of jarring to read.

However, I liked the premise.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wpzhk,t3_dxqcjf,Damn love the twist at the end! good writing!,t3_dxqcjf
f7xgeeh,t3_dxqcjf,I was expecting him to shoot his wife.,t3_dxqcjf
f7xkcu2,t3_dxqcjf,"Good SSS content without paranormality or general weirdness is pretty rare. And it's even rarer to see it executed good. You did well, dear sir/madame!",t3_dxqcjf
f7wu84v,t3_dxqcjf,"I liked it. Although I think it's pretty fast forward to solve the situation, if Ryan is clever enough to not touch or hold the gun after Will kills himself. Fingerprints would only be Will's. Anyway nice story!! I enjoyed it :)",t3_dxqcjf
f7x1z31,t3_dxqcjf,Wow that's not what I expected in a good way.,t3_dxqcjf
f7xd8yv,t3_dxqcjf,"Not that scary, but an extremely great plit twist nonetheless! Good job!",t3_dxqcjf
f7xmnqc,t3_dxqcjf,Good concept and execution.,t3_dxqcjf
f7xu2kz,t3_dxqcjf,Loved it!,t3_dxqcjf
f7xy20l,t3_dxqcjf,"You....made me think he was gonna kill Ryan but I thought he was gonna turn and kill his wife last second. Oh, wow, this is interesting",t3_dxqcjf
f7xygwp,t3_dxqcjf,Very well written! Description of what is going on is fabulous! Good job!,t3_dxqcjf
f7y4xse,t3_dxqcjf,"This is great! I'm curious how this would go down legally after the fact. 

He should have put Ryan's fingerprints on the gun somehow first. 

Regardless, it's gonna be a pretty traumatic experience lol.",t3_dxqcjf
f7y978f,t3_dxqcjf,"Fantastic writing, captivating. Great poignancy. Twist is perfect. Please write things on r/nosleep. Pretty, pretty please.",t3_dxqcjf
f7ydypl,t3_dxqcjf,I was picturing everything and for a short time I thought ryan was a dwarf or a child,t3_dxqcjf
f7yqra7,t3_dxqcjf,You really made a lot happen in a very brief story. You are very skilled.,t3_dxqcjf
f7yrdu4,t3_dxqcjf,"This was well written and had pretty good suspense, but the ending was predictable.  I knew Will was going to shoot himself because of the way he calmly grabs the gun, whistles and loads it.  Something about that gave away the ending.  Good job though!  


I know it's fiction, but this wouldn't work in real life.  The police and the coroner would be able to tell from the position and angle of the gun, entry wound, etc. that Will shot himself.  Plus, Ryan and the wife's fingerprints wouldn't be on the gun, only Will's fingerprints.   A good way that would have made this more believable is if Ryan and Will had a struggle and both kept trying to grab the gun so Ryan's fingerprints would be there too.  Still, I liked it a lot.",t3_dxqcjf
f83x9or,t3_dxqcjf,"I thought there were some cliche elements.. Like ""honey, I'm home'but otherwise a nice read.",t3_dxqcjf
f89w7it,t3_dxqcjf,Amazing writing and a great way to end it. Would you mind if I narrate it in a video tomorrow?,t3_dxqcjf
f9l3udf,t3_dxqcjf,Welp. That's one way to deal with a cheater. I guess?,t3_dxqcjf
fcal489,t3_dxqcjf,"This is very well written, and realistic. This is the almost exact scenario that happened to my friend's parents (sadly), so this was spooky to read for several reasons! Amazing writing and I really liked this one.",t3_dxqcjf
f7xbhs9,t3_dxqcjf,explanation?,t3_dxqcjf
f7vf4fc,t1_f7urgis,"Thanks, appreciate it.",t3_dxqcjf
f7w2661,t1_f7uke0n,This is really good. It took me a minute to get what was going on in the end but holy fucking shit. Very twisted and I'm honestly interested to hear where you got the idea from,t3_dxqcjf
f7x4usd,t1_f7uke0n,"the plot was unexpected, you did great!",t3_dxqcjf
f7xis6l,t1_f7uke0n,You did good. Nice job!,t3_dxqcjf
f7w8r4z,t1_f7w3b6x,"Oh, yeah. I kinda left the story there for everyone to think their own ending. There's still the horror of William shooting himself in the bedroom, tho. That's nasty.",t3_dxqcjf
f7xk1at,t1_f7w3b6x,"I donâ€™t know. It would be pretty heard to explain that to the police. If anything, they might think that the wife was an accomplice. I mean, why would someone call the police just to kill them selves?",t3_dxqcjf
f7yrv2k,t1_f7w3b6x,"Yeah, in real life this wouldn't work.  Forensics and detectives are very good at their job and the coroner would be able to tell from the angle of the gun and the position/angle the bullet went in that Will shot himself and wasn't executed by Ryan or his wife.  There also wouldn't be any fingerprints from Ryan or his wife on the gun, only Will's fresh fingerprints.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wornu,t1_f7wn46m,"It's written so that you think he'll hurt one of them! In a way I guess he did, it's a pretty bad situation.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wk8g3,t1_f7wj7si,Don't,t3_dxqcjf
f7y1637,t1_f7xndkj,Haha I was actually thinking that as I was writing it. The part where he shushes when calling the police is weird. I just imagine him doing that with the phone hand.,t3_dxqcjf
f7vf5xj,t1_f7v2y7a,Appreciated.,t3_dxqcjf
f7wov59,t1_f7wokia,May I ask what you thought would happen? Thanks for commenting!,t3_dxqcjf
f7wuueg,t1_f7wtnx4,"Oh, yes. I tried to keep the dialogue just short enough. The pacing's weird sometimes, though. I'm glad you liked it!",t3_dxqcjf
f7wsyfv,t1_f7wrkuz,"I see what you mean. Now that I re read it, I can tell some parts have weird pacing. Thanks for the feedback!",t3_dxqcjf
f7wuq45,t1_f7wpzhk,Thanks! Glad you liked it!,t3_dxqcjf
f7ysnlk,t1_f7xgeeh,"I don't know why, but when he calmly grabbed his gun, I knew he was just going to shoot himself.  Maybe because that's what I would do if I came home and my wife was with another man.  I wouldn't shoot them, I'd just shoot myself to avoid the years old suffering that will follow.",t3_dxqcjf
f7xnnjm,t1_f7xgeeh,Same,t3_dxqcjf
f7wuik5,t1_f7wu84v,"I'm glad you enjoyed! I like that you're thinking your own ending, it's open to interpretation. Thanks!",t3_dxqcjf
f8a3e59,t1_f89w7it,Please do! Sounds good!,t3_dxqcjf
f7xwbjm,t1_f7xbhs9,Husband took a revenge by making it look like the wife's affaire is an intruder that shot him dead.,t3_dxqcjf
f7y0f70,t1_f7xbhs9,And she wont get the insurance because it was suicide!,t3_dxqcjf
f7wuozr,t1_f7w2661,Thanks man! The idea just kinda came to my head from nowhere lol. I've a lot of ideas but I rarely write them down. Maybe I should do it more often!,t3_dxqcjf
f7xxjfk,t1_f7xk1at,"Except the gunpowder residue is on Wills hands, this would be tested for and its a really quick test. The will then test Ryan and seeing he didnt have any his story would check out.",t3_dxqcjf
f7y5kr1,t1_f7xk1at,"Yeah... no. Gunpowder residue. The fact that the gun is Will's, too.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wp9pq,t1_f7wov59,That he was have shot both of them but I love the way you ended it. And youâ€™re welcome. Still itâ€™s a really good story,t3_dxqcjf
f7ww20d,t1_f7wuueg,"I appreciate stories like this, in that they are realistic and completely plausible. Nothing supernatural or crazy; it just plays on human emotion in a very common scenario.",t3_dxqcjf
f7wt5x7,t1_f7wsyfv,"Any time, lol.

And I'd like to add that it is a good idea and I liked reading it.",t3_dxqcjf
f8e7d48,t1_f8a3e59,Video's up. Hope you like it. I was sick so my voice isn't the best. https://youtu.be/EtuAkXTQPSk,t3_dxqcjf
f7wxtnj,t1_f7ww20d,Thanks! I intended to make it as human as possible. Appreciate it!,t3_dxqcjf
f8e7ur8,t1_f8e7d48,Love it! I like the work you did with William's voice when he first shows up. Really good!,t3_dxqcjf
