f9wbloj,t3_e5dgcn,"I fucking knew it. I fucking knew you'd be a damn good horror writer. Peeping Tom was disturbing- but this? This is TERRIFYING.

Edit: Just realized Peeping Tom got taken down. Kind of a shame, but I understand why the mods did it, I guess.",t3_e5dgcn
f9x5vep,t1_f9wbloj,"Thank you u/Temborb! I'm thrilled you liked it! Being possessed is one of my biggest fears so it was really fun to write a story about it.

And yeah, kinda sucks about Peeping Tom. But I guess I'm more proud of it for the controversy it created. I hope to write more stories that get banned in the future!",t3_e5dgcn
f9xckqp,t1_f9x5vep,"The controversy and shock value is what gives it that extra flavor. Also, you really know how to pull off a twist, which is quite refreshing for the horror side of reddit. You've definitely gained a follower. Keep doing you, my dude!",t3_e5dgcn
