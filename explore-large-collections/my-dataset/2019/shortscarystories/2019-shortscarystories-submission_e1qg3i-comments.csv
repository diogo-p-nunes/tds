f8tzyrg,t3_e1qg3i,The word “theatre” being repeated 8 time’s in the first paragraph was a bit of a turn off.,t3_e1qg3i
f8r4pjh,t3_e1qg3i,"I would like to give thanks to everyone that read this story. It is my first story I've ever written and posted on this subreddit. I had to cut alot of words, sentences and information from the story as it made the story go over the 500 word limit so if it feels that some content is missing or that more information could've been added that was why. Feedback is appreciated and....thats about it so thanks for reading (idk how to end this).",t3_e1qg3i
f8u0hy3,t1_f8tzyrg,Yeah I didn't really notice that next time I'll have to make sure have repetition of single words or phrases as much thanks for the feedback too,t3_e1qg3i
