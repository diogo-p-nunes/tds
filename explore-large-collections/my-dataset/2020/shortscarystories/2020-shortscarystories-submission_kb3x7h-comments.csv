gffq9af,t1_gffn1td,"Hey there, I‚Äôm sorry if this story seemed too long for your liking.

At the top of the r/shortscarystories page you‚Äôll find that it explicitly states, ‚ÄúA place for Horror and Thrills in 500 words or less.‚Äù 

I can assure you that this story does meet that criteria. 

Thanks for reading :)",t3_kb3x7h

gfh027b,t1_gfgz851,No problem.  Thanks for the compliments!,t3_kb3x7h
gfl1q0e,t1_gfl1436,"No no.  The Russian heritage is only relevant as to show that when Max got his DNA results, they did NOT align with what he believed to was his DNA Genealogy.  They did not kidnap/murder because they were Russian, they were murderers and kidnappers that happen to have believed Russian ancestry.

It was more or less the first, ‚Äúclue,‚Äù or foreshadow that something about his family situation was very wrong",t3_kb3x7h
