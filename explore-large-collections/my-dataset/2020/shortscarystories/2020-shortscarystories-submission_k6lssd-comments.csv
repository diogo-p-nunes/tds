genh29t,t1_gen951g,"In my original plan the pancakes were a kind of last meal. Once the narrator finished them the waitress used magic to suck out the narrator's life force and fuse their corpse with the upholstery. That said, I ran out of words so I decided to axe that idea and go with an ambiguous escape instead. 

In the end though what would've happened is up to the reader's imagination. Thank you for reading!",t3_k6lssd
