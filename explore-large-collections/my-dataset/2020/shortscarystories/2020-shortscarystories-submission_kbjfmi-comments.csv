gfht1ph,t3_kbjfmi,"My stories arenâ€™t limited to extremely depressing stuff, promise. Iâ€™m actually pretty hopeful about the future of humankind if we can just chill the f*** out and be nicer to each other.

In any case, check out [WestCoastDerry](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestCoastDerry/) for more thrills and chills!",t3_kbjfmi
gfi1xtw,t3_kbjfmi,"I should have seen that twist coming haha, but either way I liked this a lot! :)",t3_kbjfmi
gfkev3b,t3_kbjfmi,Awesome story!,t3_kbjfmi

gfkw6ki,t3_kbjfmi,I thought the people that fled their planet would take control of earth and kill the humans so that they don't destroy the planet.,t3_kbjfmi

>This new world is an evil place. The species here is self-devouring. They kill each other without remorse, standing atop the corpses with pride. They gleefully deprive each other of resources. Knowing better, they destroy the land. Knowing better, they take more than what they need and watch with indifference as others suffer.Â 

This is where I saw it coming. But it still kept me hooked because your wordsmithing. Great story!",t3_kbjfmi
gfnfxnb,t3_kbjfmi,"I thought maybe they were fleeing earth only to discover that every planet destroyed itself the way they did. I thought it was being described in such a destructive and savage way because they were seeing it from an outsiders perspective, rather than their own. Either way, cool story!",t3_kbjfmi
gfn8umi,t3_kbjfmi,Predictable tbh,t3_kbjfmi
gfjpf4o,t1_gfi1xtw,"Glad you liked it! Iâ€™m working on not telegraphing twists quite as much, so itâ€™s cool to see Iâ€™m getting better. Slowly but surely â€” not my best skill as a writer ðŸ™Œ",t3_kbjfmi
gfknvkr,t1_gfkev3b,Thanks so much for reading!,t3_kbjfmi
gfjvwzq,t1_gfjvjwe,Damnnnnn honored. Maybe Iâ€™ll roll the dice!!!,t3_kbjfmi
gfl12ew,t1_gfkw6ki,Ooooo thatâ€™s a rad idea.,t3_kbjfmi
gfmv4mq,t1_gfmtycu,"Haha yeah that was pretty heavy handed, a lot of the author coming through there. Twists are the hardest! 

Thanks for reading, I love hearing what people think and knowing where I can keep working as a writer.",t3_kbjfmi
gfnh76l,t1_gfnfxnb,"Whoa that would be cool! Like some sort of rot is permeating the galaxy, destroying everything the same way. Put it in the perspective of humans who are leading earth, only to realize that the same problem is happening elsewhere. 

That would be effing terrifying because so many sci-fi movies have us believe that human problems wouldnâ€™t exist elsewhere.",t3_kbjfmi
gfniliy,t1_gfnh76l,Yeah! Exactly!,t3_kbjfmi
