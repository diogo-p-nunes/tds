Thanks for reading! This has been another submission to the somewhat weekendly series where I use a random word generator for a story topic. This weekend’s word was, you guessed it: horseshoe. 

All criticism is welcome. Do you dislike my story? Are you offended by my story? Are you confused by my story? Are you feeling any existential dread that may or may not be related to my story? Feel free to let me know. 

Make sure you check out my archive at r/SleepfullyAwake, where dreams become reality. 

I’ve rambled long enough, so remember...
