ggcxwm1,t1_ggcxett,"Oh I see, thanks! May I ask what it means when the mom said “you can be whatever you wish, as long as you don’t complain along the way”?",t3_kg29ed
ggcyeim,t1_ggcxwm1,"Sure! The last line implies that the children died because of normal childhood complaints. The parents are barely getting by (implied in the father’s 9-5 job and the mother being jobless.) Children don’t understand the struggle adults face, which is why the protagonist thought everything was fine. Because of the complaining, the parents eventually snapped, leading to the premature demise of the protagonist and his brother.",t3_kg29ed
