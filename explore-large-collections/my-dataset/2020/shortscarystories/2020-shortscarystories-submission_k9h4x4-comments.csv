gf55cp3,t3_k9h4x4,Congratulations! You have angered the void,t3_k9h4x4
gf61qvv,t3_k9h4x4,"Great story, but quick question- what are you orbiting if the gravitational mass of Earth is gone? Wouldn't that cause the moon and anything orbiting to spin off into the void?",t3_k9h4x4
gf5jmkw,t3_k9h4x4,That dark matter sucks...,t3_k9h4x4

gf5r0pm,t3_k9h4x4,"I really love Sci-fi horror, And my guy you definitely nailed it",t3_k9h4x4
gf6jcgz,t3_k9h4x4,"I love it when a sci-fi story is scientifically plausible and the fictional part stays logical (at least as far as I can tell. I'm not a physicist)
Also nice nod to dust (if that is where you got the inspiration)",t3_k9h4x4
gf5038n,t3_k9h4x4,I really like this concept :),t3_k9h4x4

gf6hk0o,t3_k9h4x4,Wow! I love that the story has more than one layer of horror. Congrats!,t3_k9h4x4
gfmwlu7,t3_k9h4x4,"If  you’re walking home from the park half mile away, and don’t arrive  within the hour, it’s clear something out of the ordinary happened.  Maybe you ran into a friend, or a car ran into you 😂 That’s the essence  of the paradox. I recently wrote a quite well received article on the  subject:

You should do one about a “false vacuum” event.",t3_k9h4x4
gfccjhc,t3_k9h4x4,"The dark mass is keeping you tethered to Earth. A great irony! You try to leave, and by leaving, you will remain in place for eternity, or until you die.",t3_k9h4x4
gf6kw0j,t3_k9h4x4,Might be my favorite so far. Good work,t3_k9h4x4
gf6x1vw,t3_k9h4x4,"I didn't know till that I'm missing a story like this so badly. Thank you, it's in the top5 I ever read here!",t3_k9h4x4
gf750ih,t3_k9h4x4,This gives me hope about intetstellar travel. Dont pls:{,t3_k9h4x4

gfnl8p7,t3_k9h4x4,Love the Wow reference in one of your other stories.,t3_k9h4x4
gftgh2v,t3_k9h4x4,"Superb story, reminds me a bit of Interstellar.",t3_k9h4x4
gfsdfyu,t3_k9h4x4,">We can’t leave. We can’t travel faster, because the dark matter will wipe us out. We can’t fly away, because we don’t have a reasonable destination to go to.

You could still move with STl speeds, nothing prohibeting amat boosted fusion drives or lightsails.",t3_k9h4x4

gf6qxur,t1_gf61qvv,"F. You're right.

Lets just say the dark matter mass allows the ship to orbit it and call it even",t3_k9h4x4
gf6blrn,t1_gf61qvv,"It sounds like the mass wasn't destroyed, just compressed, which means it would still have the same gravitational pull as the Earth.",t3_k9h4x4

In this case, it isn't.",t3_k9h4x4
gf6hw7c,t1_gf63if3,100% that’s exactly how it happened,t3_k9h4x4
gfnluqt,t1_gfnl8p7,I'm glad someone picked up on that haha. Little subtle easter egg but hard not to do with space stories,t3_k9h4x4
gf6rycm,t1_gf6qxur,"Even it is then, especially because otherwise it is a great story. If you get it published though, maybe the remaining crew is simply tumbling through space, praying that they don't collide with an object and wipe out humanity in a small, high pressure 'pop'. 

I hope my comment didn't come off as too critical, I was sure there was something I just didn't understand.",t3_k9h4x4

gf6sbqb,t1_gf6rycm,"Nah you're good. I post these shorts on reddit for practice/feedback anyway. 

Since its dark matter and we don't know a ton about it I'd say its plasuable to have it still have a gravitational pull, but I like your idea much better of them just drifting. Maybe have them orbit the moon while the moon floats away.

I put a bunch of my shorts in one document and hope to get that published someday, but that also means I won't be limited to 500 words, so I can have more details like the ones were talking about.",t3_k9h4x4
gf793bk,t1_gf78u9i,Space wizards. It's what this story needs,t3_k9h4x4
gf742m7,t1_gf6sbqb,"Actually, I’ve been saving a select few of these short short stories to pitch to my own literary agent as an anthology; no idea when, so go ahead with your own plans, but this is one I saved, FYI. Nice work.

EDIT: (for clarity) An anthology of multiple authors",t3_k9h4x4
gf6ue46,t1_gf6sbqb,"Or they're in a constant drift orbiting the moon, trying not to collide with the moon and its pieces as they get thrown through the asteroid belt. I know the asteroids out there are far enough apart for a ship to pass through easily, but imagine the moon getting eviscerated and that's their biggest  threat- pieces of the moon that they're orbiting threatening to destroy them.


But hey, you're doing a great job of writing this story, not me.",t3_k9h4x4

*every story*",t3_k9h4x4
gf75302,t1_gf742m7,I mean this is my story so I wouldn't go ahead with pitching it to someone and passing it off as your own.,t3_k9h4x4
gf7qdti,t1_gf6ue46,"If they are (or were) orbiting the Earth then we're talking about an LEO velocity of 7km/s or so.  The Moon having an escape velocity of 2.4km/s from its surface (let alone for something 380,000km away), either through crazy random happenstance they are on a collision course with the Moon or else they escape from its gravitational influence.",t3_k9h4x4

""What does Lord of the Rings need?""
Space.

""What does Dune need?""
Orks.

""What does Star Wars need?""
Gratuitous violence.

""What do Catholics need?""
To go to space.


Each of those is already arguably great, *with wizards*.",t3_k9h4x4

Ughhh",t3_k9h4x4
gf75q4i,t1_gf75302,"Noooo. Absolutely no worries. I just wanted to mention it to give you some encouragement, that’s all. Sorry to scare you. 

That’s why I said it would take a long time. I’d have to contact every author, get permissions, arrange royalty payments, etc. 

Professionals don’t steal. If they do, they don’t stay in the business for long. I mean... I get this is Reddit, & why you’d be worried... but you don’t need to be. If I had nefarious plans, it’d be pretty stupid for me to (a) confess right here out in the comments, and (b) steal a story that’s so easily Googled.

EDIT: Looking back at my OG comment, I can see how it might have been taken the wrong way.",t3_k9h4x4

I'm new to all this (I don't even lnow how one goes about getting sonething published) so it's easy to get defensive. I see what you mean now so no worries :)",t3_k9h4x4
gf7731y,t1_gf76sws,"Oh, I get you. I actually edited my own comment before posting, lol. It wasn’t angry—just SHOCKED, ha ha... then I realized I myself had done a lot of assuming, & realized: oh, probably is going by Reddit. Tell you what: DM me anytime; this convo probably would be better there, lol",t3_k9h4x4
