gfdm8wk,t3_kazbzv,"Wow. I've always thought multiple life sentences were a waste, but this is horrifying.",t3_kazbzv
gfebltl,t3_kazbzv,"I didn’t expect that ending at all, this is super creative and well written",t3_kazbzv
gffbq5r,t3_kazbzv,This is beautifully horrific and horrifyingly beautiful. Too bad only one-shots are allowed in this sub.,t3_kazbzv
gfel9bv,t3_kazbzv,Impressive.  You have a new fan!,t3_kazbzv
gff11oo,t3_kazbzv,Can you explain what’s happening to the prisoner? I don’t understand,t3_kazbzv
gfef0nb,t3_kazbzv,I like this. Great work,t3_kazbzv
gfeo3lf,t3_kazbzv,"1,600 years? Sheesh. What we need would be humane prisons that focus on rehabilitation, such as Halden Prison in Halden, Norway.",t3_kazbzv
gfepswq,t3_kazbzv,"Holy shit, that ending was awesome!!!",t3_kazbzv

gfh2ugh,t3_kazbzv,This is really good :),t3_kazbzv
gfhh0g8,t3_kazbzv,Oh this was tooo good !,t3_kazbzv
gfhtpml,t3_kazbzv,this is great! but 3rd degree murder is like manslaughter or something. sounds like this guy killed on purpose and premeditated so that would make it 1st degree murder!,t3_kazbzv
gfl08hn,t3_kazbzv,"Damn! I had to go find my husband and read this to him, he's a horror fanatic so I share the really good ones I find. This concept just fk'd with our heads big time. I'd watch this as a movie or series for sure!",t3_kazbzv
gfhufp9,t3_kazbzv,great story! this reminds me of that one black mirror episode,t3_kazbzv
gfhwgws,t3_kazbzv,I did not see that coming. Great story!,t3_kazbzv
gfhz60l,t3_kazbzv,I don’t get it,t3_kazbzv
gfi5r2e,t3_kazbzv,The only thing that threw me off is the 3rd degree murder part? That typically means the person had no intent to kill and/or it was non violent?,t3_kazbzv
gfi71t0,t3_kazbzv,If only this were possible! 👍👍,t3_kazbzv
gfk6mgo,t3_kazbzv,Super original! I love this!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,t3_kazbzv
gfh36oq,t1_gfdm8wk,"Yeah, I would bet that if this were possible, it would only happen to one prisoner. I can't think anyone else would have the balls to commit crime anymore after that!

gffbfi1,t1_gff11oo,"Kill one person, get a life sentence. Kill multiple people, get multiple life sentences.

Prisoner 1106, formerly known as Thomas Blake, killed 26 people and got 26 consecutive life sentences. Purple Tie is making him grow young so he can serve all of them. 10 down, 16 to go.",t3_kazbzv
