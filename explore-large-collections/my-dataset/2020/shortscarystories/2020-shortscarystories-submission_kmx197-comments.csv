ghhg74y,t3_kmx197,Ooooo. That's sad. Love it.,t3_kmx197
ghhvny8,t3_kmx197,wait i‚Äôm kinda confused can somebody explain,t3_kmx197
ghhc043,t3_kmx197,"I‚Äôd love to see this continued! Does Margaret become suspicious enough to take action? What does she know about the missing girl? 

I feel like we‚Äôve been left hanging here lol.

Good job though. üëç",t3_kmx197
ghmlbca,t3_kmx197,"this is one of the better ways i've seen this kind of prompt written, good on you! the devolution into paranoia was pretty fast, but you only have do many words
this is really well-written!",t3_kmx197
ghhywpw,t1_ghhvny8,My understanding is the detective IS the missing girl and she lost her memory in the accident. Margaret is a nurse and her friends and family have been coming to visit her in the hospital but she doesn't remember them.,t3_kmx197
ghhllod,t1_ghhc043,"i think the missing girl is the detective, so i doubt we‚Äôve really been left hanging",t3_kmx197

ghiv08l,t1_ghhywpw,oh !! that makes sense and it‚Äôs a cool concept,t3_kmx197

I thought that the detective and Margaret were the same person i.e double personality",t3_kmx197
