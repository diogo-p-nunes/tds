gh74ubr,t3_kl6pbm,This is hauntingly beautiful...,t3_kl6pbm
gh76fng,t3_kl6pbm,"What a well written story! Such lush language used to convey terrible sorrow. The ending was a visceral punch in the heart. Damn, great job.",t3_kl6pbm
gh7uhgd,t3_kl6pbm,"*Albert*

*I killed a child today.*

*He's dead.*

This is ironically funny out of context.",t3_kl6pbm
gh85145,t3_kl6pbm,"Bravo. 

This reminds me of what I often hear about nature being neutral: how destructive events like storms and floods are tragic and destructive, but not *evil*. And a field of flowers can be peaceful and beautiful, but not *good*. Nature is both nurturing and cruel, but neither out of benevolence or malice; it simply *is.*

But this story here, turning the sea into ancient being one who regrets at the lives they've taken and feels neglected and abused by humanity... damn. Again, bravo.",t3_kl6pbm
gh7b7e1,t3_kl6pbm,"I'm in awe, your writing is superb. I got goosebumps reading it.",t3_kl6pbm
gh7zofm,t3_kl6pbm,"“I rock him back and forth until he disintegrates into the earth once more” 

After the reveal, I read it again and this line is so beautiful and comforting.",t3_kl6pbm
gh7vahj,t3_kl6pbm,Fuck you for making me like this piece of art so much!,t3_kl6pbm
gh7jvog,t3_kl6pbm," 

""I am deeply alone, but never lonely."" this line is one of the most beautiful things i have heard",t3_kl6pbm
gh7i0zx,t3_kl6pbm,One of the rare wholesome contents.,t3_kl6pbm
gh7dml2,t3_kl6pbm,Dang,t3_kl6pbm
gh7n8am,t3_kl6pbm,Your writing and slow reveal were perfectly timed. Gave me goosebumps. Great story!,t3_kl6pbm
gh7met4,t3_kl6pbm,"Sorry to say that. You wrote it perfectly. 

I am sorry ‘cause **I** didn’t write this story",t3_kl6pbm
gh7k235,t3_kl6pbm,I'd buy this if it were in a book. Great writing!,t3_kl6pbm
gh7x8b0,t3_kl6pbm,"Well. This was creepy in a beautiful way. And in a horrible way as well. As if I needed yet another reason to dislike the ocean. I mean, the beach is good for building cool stuff out of wet sand and then watching as the tides come in and flood your little sand kingdom, but otherwise I’m not a huge fan. Though I kinda want to see what condition my dad’s glasses are in now; they were swept away like two years ago and he was pretty much blind on the drive home, I had to help him with navigating. It’d be cool to have them back, though it’s not like they would be usable.",t3_kl6pbm
gh8ht4l,t3_kl6pbm,The last 8 lines (‘I squeeze’ to ‘I am the sea.’) would make an amazing poem all on their own.,t3_kl6pbm
gh8opj9,t3_kl6pbm,If this isn't famous later I'm going to be mad. I shared it with all of my friends lol,t3_kl6pbm
gh7ui2u,t3_kl6pbm,This makes me think of one of those poems written by famous writers you hear about everywhere.,t3_kl6pbm
gh7swxq,t3_kl6pbm,Beautiful. Great work.,t3_kl6pbm
gh7zdfe,t3_kl6pbm,"This makes me have a little sympathy for the sea, rather than the usual r/thalassophobia.",t3_kl6pbm
gh7zr4c,t3_kl6pbm,"I love that. I just had to upvote the story AND every comment here, because this one really got me and regarding the comments: Nearly everything is said here already. So haunting, so beautiful, so sad and so overwhelming.

Drowning in the this unknown depth of the sea, maybe not even been recognized, was always one of my worst nightmares, but somehow your story is comforting the fright.

Which makes it both: veeerry scary, but also extremely well written and thoughtful.

I love it!",t3_kl6pbm
gh80akq,t3_kl6pbm,Very beautiful story. Very sorrowful as well. Not scary though.,t3_kl6pbm
gh848p8,t3_kl6pbm,"Jesus fucking christ, this shit always shows after a few confessions and I panick.",t3_kl6pbm

gkq6nt7,t3_kl6pbm,"this hit hard. my brother drowned when he was 3, so this hit in a whole different way. damn",t3_kl6pbm

gh8hq4l,t3_kl6pbm,"I don't understand why it would say he's the youngest?
Edit: other than that it's great and I loved it!! I just couldn't stop thinking about that part because I was thinking it was something to do with nature but then it said that the 4 year old was the youngest. I dunno I might have missed something.",t3_kl6pbm

gh8mmsl,t3_kl6pbm,"My fear of the ocean just spiked more. Thank you kind sir, but also fuck you",t3_kl6pbm
gh8sq18,t3_kl6pbm,"Wow beautiful and tragic. One catch: in the paragraph about once being an emperor, you put ""but those people are are dwindling"". I assume you meant ""are all"" or just one ""are"". 

Great story OP",t3_kl6pbm
gh8wse5,t3_kl6pbm,Wow. This piece is incredible! Thank you!,t3_kl6pbm
gh8xc3v,t3_kl6pbm,"As someone who almost drowned in the sea when I was young, this one got to me.",t3_kl6pbm
gh8xtnj,t3_kl6pbm,This feels like poetry. It feels like something that would be translated into several languages and distributed in a college English class as and example of show don’t tell. This is stunningly beautiful and honestly I think you have a future as a writer.,t3_kl6pbm
gh8xtvz,t3_kl6pbm,"In the wise words of Bill Wurtz. “You could make a religion out of this!”, wise words.

gh96rt1,t3_kl6pbm,This was fantastic! Great work!,t3_kl6pbm
gh98hge,t3_kl6pbm,Waters don’t weep for those who lie in the deep. ( Really good story. I like the slow reveal of being from the prospective of the ocean. ),t3_kl6pbm
gh7i7bm,t3_kl6pbm,"Excellent writing, excellent story...",t3_kl6pbm
gh846wu,t3_kl6pbm,"Was not expecting the sea at all, I was expecting a more general take on mother nature or Life. A beautiful story either way.",t3_kl6pbm
gh863dh,t3_kl6pbm,"Your language is so good and such different perspective. I used feel like that when see any forts or palaces that they have seen so much history if you only they have a voice, but this., This post really gave me haunting realization that sea has witnessed so much evolution or changes, in n out. Thanks for keeping me awake with this existential crisis.",t3_kl6pbm
gh86lie,t3_kl6pbm,Wow i had to read this twice for the foreshadowing. Great story man,t3_kl6pbm
gh8d9by,t3_kl6pbm,"The sea’s one of my favorite places, but it almost took me and my dad out once. We were living in Hawaii at the time and my family and I went out to the Banzai pipeline. Dad and I went looking for puka shells while Mom and my sister hung back. We got too close to the shore- mind you I’m an excellent swimmer and my dad’s a huge soldier in the Army- and we almost got swept out. Poor mom nearly had a heart attack watching us and never let us by the water there again.",t3_kl6pbm

gh92ew3,t3_kl6pbm,"This is one of the few well-written pieces I’ve seen on here. It’s a tight little piece and there’s some good writing within.  I’d lose the penultimate last line, it’s not needed. It’s a smart enough story that people who appreciate it won’t need that line. The last line is ok though. Well done thanks for posting!",t3_kl6pbm
gh9c1a5,t3_kl6pbm,"Woo, so many mixed emotions reading this.  Damn....well done!",t3_kl6pbm
gh9chry,t3_kl6pbm,"Very well done!  I thought that perhaps it was a virus, but couldn’t figure it out because they have claimed much younger children, unfortunately.

h0pqvgj,t3_kl6pbm,"This reminds me of the poem [Dover Beach](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43588/dover-beach), by Matthew Arnold.

>…for the world, which seems / To lie before us like a land of dreams, / So various, so beautiful, so new, / Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, / Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; / And we are here as on a darkling plain / Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, / Where ignorant armies clash by night.",t3_kl6pbm

gh9vexy,t3_kl6pbm,"This is absolute perfection. When I went back to re-read it, the sea references are obvious but certainly not during the first read. I LOVE these types of stories. You are incredibly talented, please keep writing and posting your stories (and approach publishers!)",t3_kl6pbm
gh9w3ag,t3_kl6pbm,"That was really beautiful. When I first read it, I thought it was some higher being who was angry for being neglected. Which I guess can be applied to the Ocean considering how we treat it and it’s permanence in this world. Overall, I really liked it!",t3_kl6pbm

I just come across this and I think it's BRILLIANT! It gives me a chill and also fills me with some kind of unexplanable melancholy. I'll be thrilled to read more stories of yours!

I'm planning to make a Vietnamese translation for this. I DO NOT make the translation for any kind of profit, of course, I just want to translate and post them on a private group by a non-profit fanpage RVN on Facebook for Vietnamese people. I will include the link to the original post as well.

I am looking forward to your permission. Thank you!

Your sincerely,
