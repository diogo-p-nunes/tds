ghbs5t8,t3_klsjfd,"What an absolute dick! Oh I wanted to know what it was like to shag my high school crush and I've taken up 25 years of your life but actually, I'm off now, thx for the memories and all that! 

It was a good story and elicited a really angry response so that's a job well done!",t3_klsjfd
ghaylb8,t3_klsjfd,I donâ€™t understand,t3_klsjfd
ghb7tf9,t1_ghaylb8,"If I'm not mistaken her husband has jumped back in time at the age of 42 to his teenage years after wishing he could be with his highschool crush. He retained his knowledge but either due to some time travel shenanigans (him going back creating a set point in time where he does that effectively creating a loop) or maybe a curse because of a deal with the devil kind of thing.
Unsure, but either way it's an interesting concept.",t3_klsjfd
ghb8625,t1_ghaylb8,Seems like he had a life before and made a wish to go back and be with his high school crush (the woman in the story) and regretted it because his life before was real and the woman loved him as he was pre-wish. He's telling her he's made the wish to go back to his old life.,t3_klsjfd
