gee6omf,t3_k5cvy0,Thank you for this.,t3_k5cvy0
gegcgeb,t3_k5cvy0,"Tbh, I‚Äôm a writer/illustrator for kids IRL (& sometimes comics.) As a longtime professional, news columnist & journalism teacher (SUNY), THIS is the sub to be if you wanna hone your craft well enough to get paid. 

The challenges for ANY writer to stick to the 500-word length, to stay on-topic, & stay original are exactly what the creative part of a writer‚Äôs brain needs to pressurize the juice. The more limits you place on the challenge, the more unique a solution your imagination comes up with to get out of the ‚Äúescape room.‚Äù 

The upvote whoring teaches you: gotta grab those eyeballs FAST. 

Life lessons count, but all the feedback in comments here is nothing but supportive; it‚Äôs like the world‚Äôs best writer‚Äôs group, lol. 

(Sorry I took so long to compliment your ‚Äúmodding.‚Äù Paraphrasing Blaise Pascal: I didn‚Äôt have time for shorter babbling.)",t3_k5cvy0
geemvqd,t3_k5cvy0,"Ah, this is the kind of sensible decision from a Mod you just can't find on a huge sub like No~~Original ideas~~ Sleep",t3_k5cvy0
geffnud,t3_k5cvy0,"Sorry about that man, I only post what the people in my basement write on the off chance that they might see their families again. I'll cut back on their rations and make sure they work more in-line with the rules from hereon!",t3_k5cvy0
geeaeea,t3_k5cvy0,Thank you,t3_k5cvy0
geesesd,t3_k5cvy0,Honest to God I do try my best to be original and scary and at the same time I want to entertain the crowd with something new. It's a difficult thing to do but when I do manage to do it sometimes everything feels amazing.,t3_k5cvy0
geh0cy7,t3_k5cvy0,"You are so right HG, this site is for the scary/ horror genre. Sad/ depressing etc have their sites, but this site is for spooky/ ghosts/ and things that go bump in the night. I suffer from certain mental health probs, but wouldn‚Äôt post anything like that here. I hope I have worded this properly because I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone. Everyone take care out there, and if you feel sad or depressed, Reddit and it‚Äôs sites CAN help you. Stay safe, ‚ù§Ô∏èüá¨üáß",t3_k5cvy0
geekw85,t3_k5cvy0,Makes sense.,t3_k5cvy0
geeekzu,t3_k5cvy0,"The one thing that concerns me is that if a sensitive theme is used, it might be perceived as dominating the story even if it isn't necessarily (just my opinion).",t3_k5cvy0
gegwkm4,t3_k5cvy0,"Guilty of this with my latest (on a different account). Felt like it was solid, but reading it back I think it just gives adrenaline rather than being actually scary",t3_k5cvy0
gef89cv,t3_k5cvy0,Would it be ok to make a story in which a persons depression takes on physical form? There by affecting all.,t3_k5cvy0
gefs4pq,t3_k5cvy0,Anybody got an example of such a story that isn't primarily scary and got in the hot section?,t3_k5cvy0
gefbkco,t3_k5cvy0,"Fair point, though I personally find mental illness far scarier than things which which don't exist, like Ghosts and Skinwalkers and covid-19

(Sorry, this joke is in very poor taste. I'm a real sicko)",t3_k5cvy0
gin6btk,t3_k5cvy0,"Depression and animosity are things of nightmares, just ask your subconscious.",t3_k5cvy0
gegtmi4,t1_gee6omf,"Yeah, that was a scary one.",t3_k5cvy0
geeujc0,t1_geemvqd,"Haha, I used to be a NoSleep mod. It's a tough gig handling so many people, and keeping track of a novella's worth of various rules. I give them credit though. They're doing the best they can with that beast.",t3_k5cvy0
gefr9qs,t1_geemvqd,"I love a nosleep but I really hate how most are series now. 

Also does ANYONE use the word ‚Äúanyways‚Äù as often as nosleep writers think they do?",t3_k5cvy0
gesrzm7,t1_geemvqd,*accidentally insults mod,t3_k5cvy0
gefgx6x,t1_geffnud,No sun light for them for two weeks. That‚Äôll get them in line! Vitamin D deficiency ain‚Äôt no joke!,t3_k5cvy0
geeuai9,t1_geesesd,That's what keeps me writing.,t3_k5cvy0
geirgbp,t1_geh0cy7,"Yeah, there's /r/ShortSadStories available for those who wish to post stories dealing with those subject matters.",t3_k5cvy0
geefwgl,t1_geeekzu,"As I said, I'm not going to be holding these stories under a microscope and making judgements on how balanced the horror is compared to the rest of the story. This post was only a reminder that authors should be focused on stories which are meant to scare rather than to evoke sadness or any other emotion other than chills and fear.",t3_k5cvy0
gff1lnc,t1_gegwkm4,The post does say that Thriller is acceptable,t3_k5cvy0
gef9r50,t1_gef89cv,"That‚Äôs totally fine. If the story was just about a depressed person, it wouldn‚Äôt be. Bonus points for blood and guts.",t3_k5cvy0
geg91qs,t1_gefs4pq,"I‚Äôm sure there are a few in there but like I said, I‚Äôm not putting them under a microscope. This was just a polite reminder so that authors are more aware of this moving forward with their posts.",t3_k5cvy0

gefgs9b,t1_gefbkco,Whomp whomp.,t3_k5cvy0
ggl8wna,t1_gegtmi4,What happened?,t3_k5cvy0
gh6gpgd,t1_geeujc0,"I'm glad you made this rule,  there's way too many wholesome stories on that site.  i appreciate the stories if they Are good.  but not when I'm on a sub looking to be scared.",t3_k5cvy0
gh5aj2s,t1_geeujc0,Is there a sci-fi version of this stuff? I‚Äôm new to finding this reading material and stumbled upon this subreddit by looking into an authors background and the subs she‚Äôs a part of. Sorry for the word vomit,t3_k5cvy0
gefsjzp,t1_gefr9qs,"Omg finally someone said it! I love the stories but it's so annoying that every other story is a series or some kind of sequel/prequel of another story. It ruins the nosleep feel for me tbh.

Since they're doing so well I thought this was a very unpopular opinion on my part.",t3_k5cvy0
gefxz7h,t1_gefr9qs,"I quit reading nosleep stories when they started doing the ""I'm a xxx, and xxx blah blah something terrible is going on blah blah"" titles.",t3_k5cvy0

geegm4x,t1_geefwgl,Fair enough. :),t3_k5cvy0

geg3kub,t1_gefl753,Ha ha ha!,t3_k5cvy0
gfcy9zi,t1_gefl753,"Boom, Roasted!",t3_k5cvy0
gh6iael,t1_gh6gpgd,"Never understood the whole wholesome NoSleep stuff that happened but I guess if people enjoy them that‚Äôs all well and good for them. I think as long as the protagonist of the story is scared and there‚Äôs a strong tone of horror, wholesome is okay. Still not my thing.",t3_k5cvy0
gh6i0nh,t1_gh5aj2s,There‚Äôs /r/ShortSciFiStories and /r/cryosleep. The former being almost the same as here and the latter being the NoSleep branch for science fiction.,t3_k5cvy0
gefy258,t1_gefxz7h,"I‚Äôm a therapist, and if a man with antlers takes one step closer to you every week, delete your Reddit app.",t3_k5cvy0
geg8497,t1_gefxz7h,Titles like that were banned right around the time the Search and Rescue series was posted since so many people were trying to copy that formula. I guess this was reversed at some point.,t3_k5cvy0
gegmnyi,t1_gefxz7h,"It seems like almost all of them are that way now! It‚Äôs maddening. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a therapist for demons. Today I officiated an unholy union.‚Äù Part 1 of 14.",t3_k5cvy0
geh1no7,t1_gefxz7h,I‚Äôve noticed that trend spill over here in SSS the past couple months which is a shame. I‚Äôve always hated those titles.,t3_k5cvy0
geukqd7,t1_geuiwls,"You aren‚Äôt banned. If you were, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to respond to this comment or even see inside the subreddit. I‚Äôll see what‚Äôs going on. I see you left mod messages but I haven‚Äôt seen them as they don‚Äôt show up in the Reddit app. Give me an hour or less to see what‚Äôs happened. You may be shadowbanned or our spam filter is acting up.",t3_k5cvy0

geita2z,t1_gefy258,The antlers story was pretty good though. The other one was really bad. Lol,t3_k5cvy0
gegg3b9,t1_geg8497,"About a year after, IIRC. I think that was also around when Ila stopped posting. *That* one was a huge shame.",t3_k5cvy0
gegsvt8,t1_gegmnyi,Ikr?,t3_k5cvy0
geunglv,t1_geukqd7,Oh ok no worries sorry for comment,t3_k5cvy0
gefy54x,t1_gefy3bx,Good bot,t3_k5cvy0
gessqd8,t1_gefy3bx,"Another dad bot should reply to this with, ‚ÄúHi, Hi a therapist, and if a man with antlers takes one step closer to you every week, delete your Reddit app.,I‚Äôm dad., I‚Äôm dad.‚Äù

Then it will cause a paradox and make an infinite comment string of dad bots which glitches Reddit whenever someone reads it. Then we can send a link to this post to Russia and when the Russians read it all their computers will blow up and there won‚Äôt be any more Russian trolls wandering the internet anymore.",t3_k5cvy0
geitg0y,t1_geita2z,"Oh yeah. Nothing against the plot or content, but that title trend is fully wild lmao.",t3_k5cvy0
geiqi3n,t1_gegg3b9,"Yeah, iia wrote some twisted shit. It's a shame he stopped. Though, I think it was because he was having his work stolen all the time.",t3_k5cvy0

gf8f2c8,t1_geitg0y,Do you remember the story with the rules? I really liked those but it seems they aren't that popular. Lol,t3_k5cvy0
