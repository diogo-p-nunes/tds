gfhpne3,t3_kbi1mn,This was hilarious,t3_kbi1mn
gfi2w8z,t3_kbi1mn,"I live in the shadow of Mt Rainier and if she ever blows her top we will have lahars (boiling mudslides basically) so in the valley every Monday at noon they sound the lahar siren as a test. I'm just picturing some kid using it as the perfect opportunity to freak out his sister. 

It sounds eerily similar to the siren in the Silent Hill movies so even if you didn't think water was going to dissolve your skin, it's still fairly unnerving.",t3_kbi1mn
gfhvjcd,t3_kbi1mn,"This isn't scary, this is just cute. I'm not afraid at all. To prove it I will go take a bath right now. Or maybe in a week. or a month.",t3_kbi1mn
gfhv8t0,t3_kbi1mn,I really like this one honestly. It's pretty great,t3_kbi1mn
gfj6tiy,t3_kbi1mn,"Nice story! For some constructive feedback, every time the speaker changes, it should be a new paragraph. 
Also, some of the sentences are a bit choppy and could use a comma instead of a period.
Other than that what a nice little spooky story to scare a little kid üòÇ",t3_kbi1mn
gfi4oza,t3_kbi1mn,"I love this story, I generally love stories within stories, and this is really very creative. 

If you are open to some constructive feedback- I felt there was an overuse of ‚Äúsaid‚Äù and ‚Äúsays‚Äù, especially at the start. Sometimes they can left out once the flow of conversation is established, when they are required to show who is speaking [there are plenty of alternatives, which also give context to how the words are said. ](https://www.proofreadingservices.com/pages/said)
There is also a typo on the stammered ‚ÄúY-your‚Äôre‚Äù it should be ‚ÄúY-you‚Äôre‚Äù. 

But overall a great story! Thanks for sharing.",t3_kbi1mn
gfi9o4r,t3_kbi1mn,what confuses me here is the speech marks.,t3_kbi1mn
gfiq2a5,t3_kbi1mn,My best friend and I convinced my little sister that we were vampires. She believed us for three years.,t3_kbi1mn
gfi0b63,t3_kbi1mn,lol I used such n more horrible stories to prank my elder brother. I  am younger one,t3_kbi1mn
gfj3ki1,t3_kbi1mn,"Ok I didn‚Äôt read it yet but I read the title as ‚Äúonly walter‚Äù so I know this is going to be good

Edit: I just finished it and I love it thank you",t3_kbi1mn
gfixkw3,t3_kbi1mn,This was EXCELLENT! I had so much fun reading this. That was a terrifying story though. :),t3_kbi1mn
gfi725m,t3_kbi1mn,Lovede it!,t3_kbi1mn
gfjmfdx,t3_kbi1mn,"YEEESSS!!  As the eldest of four kids, this has me in stitches.",t3_kbi1mn
gfkipmw,t3_kbi1mn,it's an awesome concept but the writing could use some improvement... I found it kind of confusing and offputting.,t3_kbi1mn
gfkopci,t3_kbi1mn,I convinced my little cousins I was fireproof... there's twelve of them and you wouldn't believe the burns now. Worth it.,t3_kbi1mn
gfq092u,t3_kbi1mn,Cool stuff! And the laugh we needed.,t3_kbi1mn
gfmq1pg,t3_kbi1mn,"Heh. That was a nice little prank. I hope the girl moves on from this, soon.",t3_kbi1mn
grbl52k,t3_kbi1mn,That was me as a big sister. It's no wonder my baby sister's scared of damn near everything even as an adult. Whoops,t3_kbi1mn
gfhpsbk,t1_gfhpne3,I always see a dark stories. I wanted to see some fun in the dark.,t3_kbi1mn
gfjljz8,t1_gfi2w8z,"Wow that's a bit scary on its own. I live near a train depot and a whistle blows every time at 8 a.m., 12 p.m. and 5 p.m. we always say you can tell the non locals by the way they jump when the whistle goes off. You can hear that sucker for miles.",t3_kbi1mn
gfhvnh9,t1_gfhvjcd,Oh no! Did I forget to mention about the tears.,t3_kbi1mn
gfhvf5n,t1_gfhv8t0,Oh why thank you. I hoped it would make people remember being messed with as a child.,t3_kbi1mn
gfjq3mk,t1_gfj6tiy,Thank you. I'll work on it. It's only been three months since I started writing stories here. I'm still learning.,t3_kbi1mn
gfjoq9f,t1_gfi4oza,"Ah, thank you for the that. I'm still learning how to put things together. I see it play out in my head and write what I see. I did notice the say/ said things after I posted it.",t3_kbi1mn
gfjkvps,t1_gfi4oza,"There's also the weird jarring effect of using so many incomplete phrases, tbh.",t3_kbi1mn
gfjnq54,t1_gfi9o4r,"Well I'm not perfect, but I'm trying. Maybe I'll get better. Maybe.",t3_kbi1mn
gfjp7p2,t1_gfiq2a5,That must have been fun.,t3_kbi1mn
gfi0g56,t1_gfi0b63,I could never get them to believe me. Unless I had a witness.,t3_kbi1mn

gfjnuv0,t1_gfi725m,I'm glad you liked it.,t3_kbi1mn
gfjmx1q,t1_gfjmfdx,Oh thank you. I'm happy it brought a smile to your face.,t3_kbi1mn
gfkk8zz,t1_gfkipmw,Well I tried. I guess I should spend more time on them then just a night before. I'll work on it.,t3_kbi1mn
gfkqc9c,t1_gfkopci,So evil.,t3_kbi1mn
gfhpvfr,t1_gfhpsbk,I love stories of sibling pranks. My brother and I are close.,t3_kbi1mn
gfi22re,t1_gfhvnh9,"Excuse me, what?",t3_kbi1mn
gfjtzze,t1_gfjq3mk,Only way to get better is to keep writing :),t3_kbi1mn
gfknn90,t1_gfjoq9f,I look forward to reading more from you!,t3_kbi1mn
gfjpqxd,t1_gfjkvps,Well nobody's perfect. I'll keep trying to get better.,t3_kbi1mn
gfi13ic,t1_gfi0g56,my brother is abit gullible and I was good story teller.. trying to improve again,t3_kbi1mn
gfhq82g,t1_gfhpvfr,"I have three older brothers. I was pranked, lied to and threaten with violence on the daily. I'm lucky I'm alive. But there were fun times of me tagging along as the little brother. Crushing their cool.",t3_kbi1mn
gfjui97,t1_gfjtzze,"Even Monday, Wednesday and Friday.",t3_kbi1mn
gg0oxv4,t1_gfjpqxd,"Oh for sure, you have a great concept. It's just an advice you can choose to take or leave but using the incomplete phrases to make a point sparingly, when used correctly is very impactful. Hope you write more!",t3_kbi1mn
gfhqdex,t1_gfhq82g,"I'm the older sibling. I'd say we both did some torturing, but if you messed with one you had us both to deal with. üòÅ",t3_kbi1mn
gfjw6wa,t1_gfhqdex,"Quick serious question:. Why?  Why do some older siblings treat their younger siblings horribly?  Do you have a mean streak in you?  Did you treat other younger children the same way?  Did it make you happy when you were being so cruel?  I'm honestly curious because I'm the youngest and my older siblings never treated me that way. Also, my friends siblings never did yet I read a lot about siblings being so cruel with each other.
Thanks for letting me know.",t3_kbi1mn
gfk0zvl,t1_gfjw6wa,"Oh no, my brother and I are very close. I wasn't mean. We played together even though I'm 6 years older. I pranked him, playfully, and he got me back. If someone (other kids) messed with him, I was very protective of him. I think some siblings don't get along because you're in the same house, day in and out, and if your personalities don't mesh, you're stuck with each other. Different friends, different hobbies, different tastes in music, etc.",t3_kbi1mn
