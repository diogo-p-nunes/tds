gg6mrlk,t3_kf19hc,Bruh I JUST put up glow in the dark stars :/,t3_kf19hc
gg6f0h7,t3_kf19hc,In space no one can hear you scream,t3_kf19hc
gg664bc,t3_kf19hc,Brilliant story. This one gave anxiety.,t3_kf19hc
gg6xn0h,t3_kf19hc,"Two touches I thought worked especially well:

‚Ä¢ The use of an ordinary item‚Äî glow-in-the-dark stars‚Äî that most people have either owned, seen, or coveted...

‚Ä¢ The concise-but-vivid physical description of the gravitational pull: ‚Äúlike two magnets‚Äù... I don‚Äôt know if this metaphor was deliberate, but it‚Äôs an effective choice because it keeps us in the kid‚Äôs bedroom, ‚Äúplaying‚Äù with the toys. Idk how many adults (lol: probably EVERYONE here, but not many others) still try to make their opposite magnets ‚Äútouch,‚Äù but it‚Äôs DEF something a kid with ceiling stars does with HIS magnets. 

The whole thing is good‚Äîthe extras vault it above. Well done.",t3_kf19hc

gg6o6kw,t3_kf19hc,I love that I found this sub. The writing quality is miles beyond r/nosleep and obviously the stories are short and sweet,t3_kf19hc
gg6uzrq,t3_kf19hc,"This was phenomenal!! at first I was expecting the red stars to be like spider eyes or something and having hundreds of spiders on your ceiling, but this absolutely blew me away. Just the right amount of mystery to keep us wondering and keep us afraid.",t3_kf19hc
gg75r4e,t3_kf19hc,"Oh god, my ceiling and walls have glow-in-the-dark stars on them...

gg7gq5q,t3_kf19hc,The sun is a deadly lazer!,t3_kf19hc
gg7pvm7,t3_kf19hc,"This was awesome, I loved the beginning most (until 'until it was gone') that really drew me into the story.

When I read the part with the eye I thought your story might have been a processing a nightmare.

What I think you could have written better are:

1. 'had panic attacks whenever my parents tried to make me'I'm not a native speaker so I'm not sure about this one, but I guess I would replace 'had' with 'got' or change the sentence towards something less passive. It just gives me a vibe of the panic attacks just happened to him and he let it happen, instead of him being actually struck by an attacking panic. If that makes sense?
2. 'a few thousand therapy sessions', this does not sound hard or long enough for me to really feel the effort and work that went into overcoming the trauma from the eye. Because sessions are short and it might have been more powerful to use wording that described more the effort instead of the time/amount. (maybe something like 'years of draining therapy' - without the years of course, because you used that already :D maybe replace twenty years with two decades)

As mentioned before I really, really enjoy this one! Please write more :)",t3_kf19hc
