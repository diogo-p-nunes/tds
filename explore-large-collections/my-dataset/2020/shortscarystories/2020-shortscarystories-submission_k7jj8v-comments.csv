gez7vcj,t3_k7jj8v,"Saw it coming. Loved it, though. Very well done. When I was growing up, we didn't have video games. Kids were still violent sometimes. There was this 10yo little psycho down the street who would throw rocks at kids on bikes. If he knocked you down, he would try to steal your bike. His parents did nothing about it - ""He's just playing"". One day his parent's came home and found him duct taped to to the side of the house (but otherwise unharmed) with a note that said, ""We were just playing"". I have no idea who did that, but it was hilarious!",t3_k7jj8v

geznqlx,t1_gez7vcj,Sounds like justice well deserved! Often I feel like violence can be attributed more to negligent parents rather than some video games.,t3_k7jj8v
