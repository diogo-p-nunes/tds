ggaprtp,t3_kfu825,"Okay so I know this one isn't *scary* scary but hear me out so you don't think I'm lost.


1.) Imagine every fictional character you've read about is real, and that once the story ends, they simply vanish.

2.) Imagine that you yourself might not be at the top of this hierarchy, and that once you fulfill your purpose, you'll vanish also.

Hope that explains why I posted it in this sub! If it still seems to violate the rules let me know, but I feel it plays on existential fear rather than scary fear.",t3_kfu825
ggbbm8h,t3_kfu825,"Reminds me of someoneâ€™s explanation of elder gods. Our reality is their dream, so when they wake up, our reality will simply cease to exist. They might not even remember what they were dreaming about.",t3_kfu825
ggb6ctk,t3_kfu825,"What a terrific read! 

As a Reader though, I feel the Livers keep living... I'll re-read their stories over and over. I'll treasure and remember stories that impacted me all my life!

And thank God for the Writers! They make it all possible, creating all those *life* stories and worlds.

But... what if I am a *Liver* and not a *Reader*? Then I pray I have a merciful Writer!",t3_kfu825

gge9r2v,t3_kfu825,"This was a really nice story, and it made me feel a sense of reminiscing over books I've read. Good job!",t3_kfu825
ggjbp8j,t3_kfu825,"If you don't write ""And they all lived happily ever after."" I'm going to find you, and I will kill you. Seriously! You can't break the 4th wall without fixing it!",t3_kfu825
ggbvs87,t1_ggaprtp,"Definitely think it fits.

Once upon a post I read someone's idea of writing a book where the main character falls in love with the reader, but knows that the book will end. I still think about that from time to time.

This will be another of those thoughts that haunts me a little. Now, if you'll excuse me, dear writer, I have some books I need to go reread. Poor things haven't lived in a while.",t3_kfu825
