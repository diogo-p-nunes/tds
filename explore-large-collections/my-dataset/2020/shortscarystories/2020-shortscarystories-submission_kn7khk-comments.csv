ghj3vp3,t3_kn7khk,Write a book write a book *write a book*,t3_kn7khk
ghiu71h,t3_kn7khk,good read,t3_kn7khk
ghizwxc,t3_kn7khk,What's scary here is that this story makes a LOT of sense and is very believable! I think OP is trying to warn us...,t3_kn7khk
ghj3qmm,t3_kn7khk,Guess Isaac didn't kill it after all...,t3_kn7khk
ghj7cvl,t3_kn7khk,*Christianity instead of Christinity? Great story!,t3_kn7khk
ghkhfss,t3_kn7khk,"You lost me at the ""Christian"" sect that split off 165 years (or so) before the birth of Christ. I think I understand what you're getting at (do you maybe mean Abrahamic, rather than Christian?), but from a storytelling perspective it doesn't quite make sense.",t3_kn7khk
ghjq47m,t3_kn7khk,Groetus be like.,t3_kn7khk
ghj4pnf,t1_ghj3vp3,I'm trying but it's harrrrrrrrrd,t3_kn7khk
ghkhko3,t1_ghkhfss,Yeah def more Abrahamic. Normally I try to comb those details out but I wrote this quickly at work one day haha,t3_kn7khk
ghjzj72,t1_ghj4pnf,Try downloading the “Story Planner” app. It basically tricks you into creating an entire outline; it’s very useful for getting you a lot farther than you might otherwise—even if you aren’t as anal-retentive about filling in all the blanks as the app wants you to.,t3_kn7khk
ghl2agr,t1_ghjzj72,"link? I've always had an interest in writing but as OP said, it's hard.",t3_kn7khk
ghnpja2,t1_ghl2agr,"At this point I just try to do it for fun, but I've actually had a few people pay to narrate stories on youtube and such.
Nothing worth bragging about, but a baby step is still a step",t3_kn7khk
ghnmmae,t1_ghl2agr,"It’s an app: for iPhones, look in the App Store; for Android-based users, I believe it’s in ... well, wherever you guys get your apps...? Google? (Sorry.) the name of the app is “Story Planner” (two words) and the app icon is white with a red Star Trek- esque triangle. 

Hope that helps.",t3_kn7khk
ghoo3up,t1_ghnmmae,"ah, ok. must not be on android then. didn't see anything like that in the store",t3_kn7khk
ghooaz2,t1_ghnmmae,yep. just googled the app and found their website. Mac and iOS only. :(,t3_kn7khk
ghowbov,t1_ghooaz2,"I’m so sorry. It is really helpful. I’ve been battling a migraine the past couple of days, but when I feel better, maybe I can post a screen shot or two to give you an idea. If enough people ask for it... they might consider developing it. It’s JUST text-based. Can’t be HARD.",t3_kn7khk
