ggjgi2h,t3_kh6j1j,"I once dropped acid at a halloween party. Interesting, but I wouldn't recommend. My costume was very half-assed cause I'd been smoking the devil's lettuce all day: a zombie with very sloppily applied make-up, and a little crow that I pinned to my right shoulder. I go to party, I drop acid, I go outside for a cigarette and when i look down at the faux crow, it looks back. I freak out and it flutters it's wings, flapping against my neck and cheek, so I rip it off and throw it at the night and I swear it flapped away.",t3_kh6j1j
