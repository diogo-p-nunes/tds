Dusty asked my dad if he locked the door, which my father said yes. Apparently during the night dusty saw a tall, lanky creature walk in and into the back room. Dusty check if he was asleep but he was awake. As he got up off the couch  following the creature, it was watching my dad. Just staring at him. when bubba and dad woke up dusty told them about it.",t3_k593ms
