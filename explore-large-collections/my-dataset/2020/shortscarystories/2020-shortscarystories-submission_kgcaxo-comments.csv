ggfbru4,t3_kgcaxo,Those neighbors are nice though,t3_kgcaxo
ggf26s5,t3_kgcaxo,"If you need more salt, you can find plenty of it on the internet. Lots of salty people all over the place lol.",t3_kgcaxo
ggg58av,t3_kgcaxo,"Omg I love that they're trying to warn them for real. I thought they were evil and the salt would actually hurt somehow, but they were genuinely trying to protect them while they were still lucid, aww. It was the licking her lips line that gave it away for me, so creepy haha!",t3_kgcaxo
ggfwybg,t3_kgcaxo,I think them trying to protect the family was pretty sweet honestly! Great story btw!,t3_kgcaxo
ggfurxs,t3_kgcaxo,I really thought they were gonna be slug-people,t3_kgcaxo
ggfg99g,t3_kgcaxo,"This was very good, I never saw it coming",t3_kgcaxo
ggfv01l,t3_kgcaxo,"Very eerie, but I would remove the line where the narrator explains it. I think it’s unnecessary and undercuts the scariness",t3_kgcaxo
ggfsg4e,t3_kgcaxo,So this was why my little brother asked for kosher salt at 2:39 in the morning.,t3_kgcaxo
ggfx97u,t3_kgcaxo,I did not see that twist coming! I was thinking that the neighbors were seasoning the kids so they'd be tastier when they were eaten.,t3_kgcaxo
ggg1n8y,t3_kgcaxo,Somehow both wholesome and terrifying. Love it. Great job please keep writing,t3_kgcaxo

ggx260d,t3_kgcaxo,Gives me spiderwick chronicles vibes - reminds me of when I was a kid and would pour salt all along my window sill and porch to protect us from the unseen monsters. My mom wasn’t a fan.,t3_kgcaxo
ggfy3c3,t3_kgcaxo,As a mother of four beautiful little mini lady humans this terrified me.,t3_kgcaxo
gggj0kd,t1_ggfbru4,"At day, at least.",t3_kgcaxo
ggfaips,t1_ggf26s5,Heh,t3_kgcaxo
ggfx0cd,t1_ggf26s5,Horrible joke,t3_kgcaxo
ggg1645,t1_ggfurxs,I thought they were either protecting them from slug people - since salt can kill a slug - or that they were “seasoning” the kids.,t3_kgcaxo
ggg2g4q,t1_ggfx0cd,Found one,t3_kgcaxo
ggg53y9,t1_ggfx0cd,Asshole person,t3_kgcaxo
