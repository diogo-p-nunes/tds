ghj0xi7,t3_kn711o,THE POINT I REALIZED JOY WAS A PARROT! I GASPED!,t3_kn711o
ghiupv1,t3_kn711o,so daisy saved her ?,t3_kn711o
ghjgez9,t3_kn711o,"Oh that's cute! I thought Daisy was a human too.  


Daisy's a good bird, I'll give her that.",t3_kn711o
ghiz5ed,t3_kn711o,holy shit i loved the ending! it completely caught me off guard. this was really well done!,t3_kn711o
ghjna68,t3_kn711o,Very good story! Daisy is a good bird 🦜,t3_kn711o
ghla016,t3_kn711o,I didn’t catch that she was a bird until the very end!! and the second read through with that in mind just let’s everything fall into place,t3_kn711o
ghj0em6,t3_kn711o,Very good indeed! I kind of guessed the twist but it didn't diminish the ending at all. It was so well done!,t3_kn711o
ghjpzqy,t3_kn711o,Enjoyed this,t3_kn711o
ghk2i4q,t3_kn711o,"I picked up on her being a bird early, but this was great! Well written, good job!",t3_kn711o
ghkdnyd,t3_kn711o,"I LOVE this. I must confess, you got me there. I was thinking ""dog"" or ""cat"" at the beginning, I didn't think about a parrot not even after the ""not telling lies"" bit. Have my upvote and keep the good work :)",t3_kn711o
ghlbeso,t3_kn711o,I thought Daisy was a dog and was like “this is predictable” then the ending happened lol.,t3_kn711o
ghoeyz6,t3_kn711o,"It would've been even more frightening if the parrot was only capable of repeating the most recently said words, and wanted to say ""murder joy"" but could only say ""sleep well""",t3_kn711o
ghkzy6y,t3_kn711o,"You're a good bird, thank you.",t3_kn711o
ghrvrok,t3_kn711o,Horace sounds like quite a killjoy.,t3_kn711o
gi2ka25,t3_kn711o,At first I thought Daisy was a dog. But a parrot?! Nice one Loved this,t3_kn711o
ghj1024,t1_ghj0xi7,"Hahahah! I love that, it’s so hard for it not to be obvious 😂😂",t3_kn711o
ghiuued,t1_ghiupv1,"Yeah, when joy gets home she’ll “repeat” what Horace said as she’s a parrot, and joy will hopefully phone them police!",t3_kn711o
ghj0f2f,t1_ghiz5ed,"Huzzah! Once again, the old switcharoo 😏",t3_kn711o
ghkf1nl,t1_ghkdnyd,"Oh, and reading it the second time makes it EVEN better. You've got an exquisite attention to detail",t3_kn711o
ghpoyyu,t1_ghoeyz6,Oooh I like that! Hopefully joy would’ve picked up on it 😬,t3_kn711o
ght843o,t1_ghrvrok,Ahahaha 😂 you might say he-races from one evil deal to another,t3_kn711o
ghkinqw,t1_ghj1024,I was thinking she was a dog myself.,t3_kn711o
