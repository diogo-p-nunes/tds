gf7o3i6,t3_k9y7cq,"I like that idea, but if she was blind before, would you really say she ‚Äúeyed‚Äù the pile of rocks?",t3_k9y7cq
gf7kstp,t3_k9y7cq,Wait I don‚Äôt fully understand,t3_k9y7cq
gf7nyny,t3_k9y7cq,"I'm not sure we've properly understood ‚Äì if she was blind at the start, how was she ""eyeing"" the pile of rocks?

Maybe because she chose to steal it, the rock had somehow always been a part of her, so now she's just relieved she has a good eye at all?",t3_k9y7cq
gf7nzph,t3_k9y7cq,How was she eyeing the rock pile if she was blind?,t3_k9y7cq
gf7t3rt,t3_k9y7cq,"My only criticism, if you can call it that, is that I didn't get that she was blind until I read the comments.",t3_k9y7cq
gf8x1f0,t3_k9y7cq," I was irrationally frustrated at everyone saying they didn't understand what was a very obvious story once you finished it. And then I realized it's obvious to me because I have a physical disability. Please don't repeat an explanation in the comments. The readers should read the comments if they don't understand. Nice work on ""thrashing with a stick,"" ""broken toes,"" ""oddly one-dimensional visions.""

You're minimizing what you've written when you write about how others have had similar twists, and you don't have to do that. Good job.",t3_k9y7cq
gf7gx29,t3_k9y7cq,Oh this is good!,t3_k9y7cq
gf8ynzd,t3_k9y7cq,This would be an interesting intro for a D&D adventure,t3_k9y7cq
gf7nwih,t3_k9y7cq,Now thats a twist,t3_k9y7cq
gf9n92z,t3_k9y7cq,"That was really good, and actually kind of beautiful! Well done.",t3_k9y7cq
gf9vh8e,t3_k9y7cq,I love it when the supernatural entity is the good one in the fic!nice work Op!,t3_k9y7cq
gjui5lu,t3_k9y7cq,Brilliant üòàüá¨üáß,t3_k9y7cq
gf8b7dm,t3_k9y7cq,I‚Äôm sorry but this just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Why was she screaming and stumbling if she could actually see. And how did the god not take an eye instead of giving her one. Why the blood? Why the random broken toes?,t3_k9y7cq
gf91j3z,t3_k9y7cq,I thought this was clear and interesting and a good twist. Of course you'd be terrified if you thought a river god was chasing you for any reason.,t3_k9y7cq
gf99dn8,t3_k9y7cq,Its good but gullabulla gotta be the worst name ever.,t3_k9y7cq
gf8b6si,t3_k9y7cq,I don‚Äôt understand,t3_k9y7cq
gfa3z6j,t3_k9y7cq,"I like it, it's vague enough but not too vague, because I had to think about the ending for a while, then read again, and then I got it. There is always someone saying they don't understand or that the story is confusing - it's not on the writer, it's on the reader, so I wouldn't pay a mind to them. Who would want a story that's fully explained and leaves nothing to imagination? Well done, bravo.",t3_k9y7cq
gf7qsmt,t1_gf7o3i6,"That's a great point, I shouldn't have used the word ""eyed"", thanks for pointing it out, I've changed the wording now.",t3_k9y7cq
gf7lqqa,t1_gf7kstp,"I think maybe she was blind, and the rock replaced one of her eyes, becoming her ""good"" eye and allowing her to see for the first time?",t3_k9y7cq
gf7m8nt,t1_gf7kstp,"I think she was blind,  the pebble she stole caused gullabulla to take one of her eyes as punishment,  she now lives with the pebble as her eye but it works and she can now see out of that eye.",t3_k9y7cq
gf89xv8,t1_gf7kstp,"I guess what happened is that many hundreds of years ago, people worshipped a river god, who's name is lost to time.

These people treated the god as a practical ""service"", like how we'd visit a doctor. People would leave a rock on the god's ""stack"", hoping to be cured of an ailment.

Over the centuries, such ""superstitions"" have become diluted to such a degree that the god is now seen as a silly local legend, with the god misnamed and misunderstood.

Somehow, Samantha pleased the ancient being, and was granted the ability to see.

I guess that legends linger, like in the Blair Witch Project; locals don't really believe in her anymore, but they wouldn't be crazy enough to spend a night in the woods which are her domain.

Who knows what other gods lie dormant?",t3_k9y7cq
gf7qpdw,t1_gf7nyny,"That's a very good point, that was an error and I've altered it, thank you for pointing it out! It was a poorly chosen figure of speech.",t3_k9y7cq
gf7sw3q,t1_gf7nzph,"She still had eyes, they just didn't work like they were supposed to!",t3_k9y7cq
gf8ystr,t1_gf8x1f0,"Agreed, I think there was plenty there to understand that she was blind and now could see, because her bad eye was replaced by a rock that apparently still functioned as an eye. Why that is is a mystery but it's a short story they are often somewhat vague but that's part of the charm.",t3_k9y7cq
gf7qx3j,t1_gf7nwih,"Thanks! To be honest, I'd be surprised if nobody had thought of a similar twist before. It's similar to ""The Book of Eli"" for example.",t3_k9y7cq
gf8d0nm,t1_gf8b7dm,probably because seeing for the first time is likely an overwhelming burst of colour you've never seen before,t3_k9y7cq
gf8ld26,t1_gf8b7dm,"The screams are from seeing the world in all of its terrifying glory for the first time.

The god took an eye, a useless one.

The broken toes are from her chaotic walk home, overwhelmed by her new sense",t3_k9y7cq
gfgs0r3,t1_gf99dn8,Ha ha yeah. You'd have to be Gullible to fall for it.,t3_k9y7cq
gfj9w9c,t1_gfa3z6j,I have read great stories here that weren't ambiguous in the end.. but I do appreciate a little of ambiguity in a well written story.,t3_k9y7cq
gf7ms7s,t1_gf7lqqa,Thanks,t3_k9y7cq
gf7qk02,t1_gf7m8nt,That's probably accurate. But it's left ambiguous as to whether she stole a pebble or simply ran off empty handed. I like a bit of ambiguity. Or maybe she placed a pebble there?,t3_k9y7cq
gf7msk5,t1_gf7m8nt,Thanks,t3_k9y7cq
gf8yuk9,t1_gf7m8nt,"Maybe he took the bad eye, and with it gone, she now can see out of the good eye that was dominated by the bad, blind eye...",t3_k9y7cq
gf8kje8,t1_gf7sw3q,Nah op admitted it was poor choice of words :p,t3_k9y7cq
gfgsqfv,t1_gfgs0r3,I see what you did there.,t3_k9y7cq
gf84kdh,t1_gf7qk02,"I can appreciate ambiguity, but I don‚Äôt think it works when the set up isn‚Äôt really clear.",t3_k9y7cq
gf9kqc1,t1_gf7qk02,I interpreted it as he 'took' her blindness from her,t3_k9y7cq
gf8hslu,t1_gf7qk02,I like that she would put one instead of take one,t3_k9y7cq
gf84dnn,t1_gf7qk02,What I got non of that from the story,t3_k9y7cq
gf85cn9,t1_gf7qk02,What do you mean 'probably accurate' and then end with a question. Didnt you write the story?,t3_k9y7cq
gf9085v,t1_gf84kdh,"Fair point, I guess I personally like stories that you interpret any way you wish.",t3_k9y7cq
gfd501b,t1_gf9kqc1,Same,t3_k9y7cq
gf90e16,t1_gf85cn9,"I guess I don't like to ""spell things out"".",t3_k9y7cq
gfwat9u,t1_gfd501b,Yep,t3_k9y7cq
gff7fcp,t1_gf90e16,I appreciate the ambiguity :),t3_k9y7cq
