gftp0bt,t3_kcw1nu,"well, you know what they say, you really can’t go wrong with a family recipe",t3_kcw1nu
gftxitb,t3_kcw1nu,Beef tastes nothing like human. Should be using ham or spam in most of her dishes to mask the taste. Terrible cheffing on her part.,t3_kcw1nu
gftml8x,t3_kcw1nu,It was the single most mouth watering thing I’ve ever read,t3_kcw1nu

gtff4ty,t3_kcw1nu,I had heard human was kinda tough or gamey. Not the most appealing of meats,t3_kcw1nu
gftekna,t1_gfsxxrv,I like to think he knows and just doesn't care (remember that black eye at the beginning? clearly her husband wasn't such a stand-up guy...),t3_kcw1nu
gftsdeq,t1_gfte6sz,"To be fair, that could’ve occurred in self-defense because the wife is at best a murderer and at worst a cannibal.",t3_kcw1nu

gfuzf99,t1_gftsi9l,And a great murderer!!,t3_kcw1nu
gfuj7zu,t1_gftxitb,Either that or she's so good at cooking she can make human taste like beef,t3_kcw1nu
gfurjk0,t1_gftxitb,..how do you know what human tastes like..>>,t3_kcw1nu
gfw6z53,t1_gftxitb,"1. Everything listed is heavily spiced or has enough ""stuff"" to cover for it not quite right.

2. The narrator has been living on Ramen noodles for two years. His taste buds are shot from all of the salt and he probably has kind of forgotten what beef tastes like.

3. The meat of an animal will taste like what has been fed to it. Giving fish, mushrooms, or broccoli to a chicken for a couple of weeks will make the meat and eggs taste odd. Eleanor's husband probably ate well up until the day she killed him.",t3_kcw1nu
gfv3z6h,t1_gftxitb,It’s the spices and sauces that make the dish!,t3_kcw1nu
