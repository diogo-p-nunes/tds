gh31xy9,t3_kkiqs5,"Damn. This was good and fresh. I though it would be a standard cannibalism story, but this is way better than that!",t3_kkiqs5
gh2v2i0,t3_kkiqs5,"Wow. Well done! 
I may have met this troubled soul back at university. I don‚Äôt think he got away with more than a few lines or lyrics though.",t3_kkiqs5

gh34z9p,t3_kkiqs5,I enjoyed reading this.  It made me think from the begining: what type of monster is he? I thought vampire with the hunger being insatiable and a drain on those around him...but the ending ... briliant!,t3_kkiqs5

gh3esv9,t3_kkiqs5,I liked this story. My only critique would be to change the first sentence in the second paragraph about finding a cure for his solution. Your story was great.,t3_kkiqs5
gh3jyeq,t3_kkiqs5,Psychic vampires damn that's good,t3_kkiqs5
gh3shyf,t3_kkiqs5,"Oh, I like that twist! I was expecting cannibalism, like someone else said. Very nicely done! I did not expect thought eater. Kinda creepy to think that if someone had this way of eating, no one would ever know.",t3_kkiqs5
gh3tvby,t3_kkiqs5,Great story! Reminds me of Colin Robinson from What We Do In The Shadows (TV series),t3_kkiqs5

gh49wmh,t3_kkiqs5,Nice,t3_kkiqs5
ghbawgj,t3_kkiqs5,"Really really good story, dude",t3_kkiqs5
gh4hxl5,t3_kkiqs5,"This reminds me of a story I read one time, I can't remember the name, but it was about  beings who disguised themselves as hats that humans were drawn to. Once on the heads of the people, the beings would consume their thoughts. The beings also made a noise, ""moob."" At least I think that's what it was. I really wish I could remember the name, I read it a long time ago but I remember it being really good.",t3_kkiqs5

gh44x5d,t1_gh3djel,"From my reading, it says it's completely legal so he isn't physically harming them in any way. Reads like he is siphoning their minds.",t3_kkiqs5
