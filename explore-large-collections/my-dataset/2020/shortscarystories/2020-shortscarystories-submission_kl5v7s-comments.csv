gh6yntw,t3_kl5v7s,"**Soundtrack: Jack Stauber - Gettin‚Äô My Mom On**

Based on several true stories, intermixed and intermingled and intermangled to form this interesting question. Does the eye in fact go POP?! when you jab it with a needle? And will it regain its bulbous properties given time?

Only one way to find out! (Let me know the results in the comments).

As always, feedback and critique is more than welcome!

gh75elb,t3_kl5v7s,Bruh I have intrusive thoughts about needles in eyes all the time so this was extra horrifying for me. Good job.,t3_kl5v7s

*AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOHMYGODWHATTHEACTUALFUUUUCKAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH*
oh and the pop sound is perfectly normal. I'll report in a few days if the eye inflates again, for now it's very flatly dangling and dripping down my cheek. Cheers",t3_kl5v7s
gh7rqnv,t3_kl5v7s,I mean even though this time I knew it was you and I knew it was going to be your writing it didn't make it any less amazingly disturbing great job yet again I always love to see these stories POP! up on my home page.,t3_kl5v7s
gh87sps,t3_kl5v7s,"This was an interesting experiment! 

Results:
Everyone‚Äôs different. Some pop, deflate, and then reinflate. Others pop and stay deflated. Then some just bleed.

This was gruesome lol. Love it!",t3_kl5v7s
gha6pq1,t3_kl5v7s,"Well, just tried: two if them went slimy and dangly, one popped, one popped but started inflating recently. Fifth I spared, as I still need a bit of a vision.


Btw, eyes taste awful - i ought to chew one of dangling off, as it closed the view of the remaining one",t3_kl5v7s
gh7v0r0,t3_kl5v7s,Love this. Great work.,t3_kl5v7s
gh7w4ix,t3_kl5v7s,"Yuck, I don't like the idea of needles and eyes... But you always do this to me... I kind of know what's coming, yet I have to read on! üñ§",t3_kl5v7s
gh9d59s,t3_kl5v7s,"Ok that literally made me throw up in my mouth a bit.....wtf Hyper?!?!
Always a wild ride with your stories my friend...guess I can add nauseating to your repertoire..lol

Anyway, good story, nice eyes.",t3_kl5v7s

gh7tbev,t1_gh74086,"Mine didn‚Äôt even bleed outwardly, but the gelatinous texture wasn‚Äôt disappointing. It was sort of a small, nearly inaudible pop, and I do have a small subconjuctival hemorrhage now, but no deflation was observed. it was worth it for science.",t3_kl5v7s
