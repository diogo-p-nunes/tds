ggrfvdg,t1_ggo0e15,I know just the one you're talking about lol!,t3_khodrs
ggq2qv5,t1_ggooazi,"I like to look at it the following way - our ''detective Hirsch'' here is not actually real, she's an unfulfilled dream and what actually happened is that Noelle Hirsch was the ''bad man's '' last victim (i.e. that's when the police caught the kidnapper). The other part's up to interpretation, but I assume she died and is replaying what happened to her when she was hospitalized, self-inserting her ''future self'' into the narrative.",t3_khodrs
