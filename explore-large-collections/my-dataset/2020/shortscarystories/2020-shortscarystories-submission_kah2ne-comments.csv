gffgnly,t1_gfck2cq,"Rodney, who was the bully in real life.",t3_kah2ne
gfb1ug6,t1_gfb180h,"Actually that was not really the point. It was not the game that pushed him, rather the bully. I do not want to in any way make a statement that games cause violence, because I do not believe they do.",t3_kah2ne
gfci3fo,t1_gfb1ug6,"OP, I loved it for several reasons & I immediately got that he killed himself because of his Bully.  The facts you gave us about him being a Griever in game & bullying victim in the real world were pivotal for me.  I also appreciated that you also hinted at the mother not understanding her son or giving him respect regarding his game prowess (self perceived prowess perhaps?).  All in all it ticked off a lot of cerebral boxes for me.  I don't expect to necessarily find them in these short scary offerings...for this I thank you ... please keep writing & sharing",t3_kah2ne
