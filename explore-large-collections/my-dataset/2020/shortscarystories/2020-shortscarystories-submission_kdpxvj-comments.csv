gfxwsa2,t3_kdpxvj,Holy shit what a ride... I'm not sure if I'm impressed or nauseous. I think both!,t3_kdpxvj

gfzgorr,t3_kdpxvj,Nice. Great work!,t3_kdpxvj
grvxb5x,t3_kdpxvj,I absolutely love stories written in a transcript form. This was excellent. Great work,t3_kdpxvj
gg1xe3n,t3_kdpxvj,"This felt so much like a found footage movie, and I mean that as a compliment. It felt gritty and real, and was easy to lose myself in. You conveyed RH's madness incredibly well. I enjoyed this wild little ride you took me on.",t3_kdpxvj
gfxxg0o,t1_gfxwsa2,"WHOA I just thought of something based on your comment. It's sorta set up like a carnival ride. (SIX FLAGS ARE YOU LISTENING?!) We need some animatronics, a *Pirates of the Caribbean*\-type setup to take riders on a tour of Harrington's mansion. Would be so awesome, I'd wait in line :)",t3_kdpxvj
gfyjtf1,t1_gfyhgh6,"Damn what an honor! u/hyperobscura is a big inspiration to me. Those short stories are so rad. Thanks for reading, glad you enjoyed it.",t3_kdpxvj
gfzmm32,t1_gfzgorr,Thanks for checking it out! Glad you enjoyed it!,t3_kdpxvj
gg1xx01,t1_gg1xe3n,"Thatâ€™s a huge compliment! Found footage is my fave. I also started out with screenwriting before switching to fiction, so Iâ€™m so glad the cinematic stuff is still there. 

Huge compliment. You made my Wednesday. Glad you enjoyed the ride!",t3_kdpxvj
gfxywti,t1_gfxxg0o,"I believe the tickets would sell out, just make sure the ride's cars have splash guards!",t3_kdpxvj
gfyllwt,t1_gfyjtf1,"Haha, you hold your own pretty good, friend ;) Love the format on this one, really sets the stage for the story.",t3_kdpxvj
gfzq74p,t1_gfxywti,Oh dear lord,t3_kdpxvj
gfyly7m,t1_gfyllwt,"I love writing in screenplay format. Really allows you to cut to the chase with the basic details and focus on dialogue, which is by far my favorite thing to write. Glad to be here; glad for Reddit and the writing community Iâ€™ve found ðŸ™Œ",t3_kdpxvj
