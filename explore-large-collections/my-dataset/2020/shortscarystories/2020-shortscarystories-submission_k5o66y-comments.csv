gei614b,t1_gegtsny,"r/nosleep has triggers you can add i.e child abuse. r/shortscarystories does not. I'd be more than happy to accompany posts with a TW, if the moderators build a flair function into the community.

I'm sorry that it didn't have one. My options were limited; the story is at 499 words.",t3_k5o66y
