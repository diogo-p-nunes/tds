geoegr9,t3_k72gw3,"Why did I immediately think of oxen when I read the title? Lol
This was great and the line ""It burbled out of his mouth, frothing at the edges"" made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.",t3_k72gw3
gepvxpm,t3_k72gw3,Sounds like Jake really upped the ante...antler.,t3_k72gw3

geoj1ax,t3_k72gw3,"I always love seeing people at my author‚Äôs page, [WestCoastDerry. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestCoastDerry/) Stop on by for some genre pieces ‚Äî something for everyone!

Edit: lol broken link again. No idea why this happens.",t3_k72gw3

gexdhum,t3_k72gw3,"This was gross, I really loved the imagery. Really gave me old slasher/nody horror vibes, like something from a Nightmare on Elm Street movie.",t3_k72gw3
gerzxra,t3_k72gw3,"Love it, a gym related creepypasta.",t3_k72gw3
gevls33,t3_k72gw3,"Though I did expect it I liked the writing style. Also, ew.. Lol!",t3_k72gw3
gf81rgd,t3_k72gw3,"Bone broth: this has not been verified by the FDA. Which also means it's not necessary to put ""side effects"" on the label. Womp womp.",t3_k72gw3
gepxt2z,t3_k72gw3,I don‚Äôt get it,t3_k72gw3
geoeo6a,t1_geoegr9,"Lol that line grossed me out too. I had this professor in college who literally frothed at the mouth when in the heat of professing, which is where I grabbed the imagery. A real buddy of mine is the inspiration for the lifter, always has some effed up animal product in his gym bag. Not cremains that I‚Äôm aware of but you never know.",t3_k72gw3
geoiv4y,t1_geogocn,Thanks! Got inspired haha.,t3_k72gw3

So hard to not Telegraph a twist. I thought that one was expertly done. Other people probably caught it but I‚Äôm not one of them!
