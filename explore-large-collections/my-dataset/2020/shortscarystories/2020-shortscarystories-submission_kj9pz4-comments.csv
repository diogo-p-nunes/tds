ggwo7fp,t3_kj9pz4,"Like the story! I am German, so I just wanted to give you the tip, that what a German would shout in that moment would actually be more something like „Lauf! Lauf!“ 
It‘s more common. Also if you still would like to go for „Rennen“, the correct form would be „Renn! Renn!“",t3_kj9pz4
ggz88vx,t3_kj9pz4,"Loved the story AND the comments. I’m a native English speaker, but I learned Spanish & French as a child, & Dutch later on. I love love LOVE the German language. It’s so beautiful. To me, it sounds like music. 


(It doesn’t sound like WWII movie “German”— that’s just silly. I wish Americans remembered that AMERICANS don’t sound the way Americans sound  in those old movies either!)",t3_kj9pz4

ggx5wmc,t1_ggwp8lm,"I just want too add: It‘s a very nice story, I was thinking at first it‘s a tourist who doesn‘t know about the [Bullrace of Pamplona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_bulls?wprov=sfti1) I really liked it!",t3_kj9pz4
