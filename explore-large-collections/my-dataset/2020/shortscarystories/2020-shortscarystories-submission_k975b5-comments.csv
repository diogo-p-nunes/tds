gf6yo9i,t3_k975b5,"Since you asked for feedback...

I very much liked the concept. You pulled me in immediately, wondering why those 10 doors, and why those experiences.

You had some room on word count, so I think it would have been beneficial to add some detail about how you recognized the doors. You don't say which are open, or if they're cracked open or wide open. I mean, I could not remember what my dorm room door looked like after 10+ years out of college. Maybe there's a dry erase board on the outside? Maybe there's a Metallica sticker plastered on it? Someone's initials carved? Maybe you can see a set of bunk beds inside cause it's cracked open?

And why so many hotel doors? Who remembers what hotel rooms look like? They're so generic. What about the door or the room inside sparked recognition? Did you mean to say your first New York apartment? Not hotel? The balcony view of the city, is that a glass door you can see through? How do you know it's to the balcony?

I would've liked to see some variety, maybe a door from childhood, from school perhaps. It could have a poster that says ""Welcome to Mrs. Spencer's 4th grade class."" Like what childhood trauma could be there he'll have to relive?!? And then maybe a door with a glass window cut out, and you can see a hospital bed inside. Most people reading/writing on reddit have attended some kind of school or have been to a hospital. They're relatable and we can all think of traumatic or painful experiences that could happen there, so you can get away with not mentioning specific experiences in the next paragraph. Very much like you alluded to with the balcony. That was very well executed.

I hope this is the type of critique you were looking for. If you choose to take any of this advice and rewrite I would love to read. I thought this was a fantatic story.",t3_k975b5

gf74g4t,t1_gf6yo9i,"Thank you for the feedback. Like I said, I did this for an assignment. We had to write something that comes to mind when looking at a [picture](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xQQaOEsCoaCPcXZGnT_hG4t6QVI6lJa-3eah1LBEZbCZHkFXKn9yylbfs-NNUrBlDsobo15stelwvKi-j6n6UNEl7GgwgoRu0cSy-XI1QaYHP6WRlDcE6ymz7BF3jATJ_UfMncik).  The minimum was ten sentences. I felt like what I wrote fit with what people post in this subreddit, so I was just testing what other people think (and to see if I can get some karma lol).",t3_k975b5
