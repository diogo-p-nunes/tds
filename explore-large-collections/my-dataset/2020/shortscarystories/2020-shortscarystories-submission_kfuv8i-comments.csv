ggb1ij8,t3_kfuv8i,"Neat story, but why didn't the cow die right away? Twenty years in two seconds would have killed poor Bessie dead! Are the effects different for everything or everyone?",t3_kfuv8i
ggcuy04,t3_kfuv8i,In witch dance on the Natchez trace park way in Mississippi there are stories of where witches would dance and everywhere they danced there would be nothing able to grow there and it would be in a perfect circle. Maybe its something to look into,t3_kfuv8i
ggcdjl3,t3_kfuv8i,"Excellent story. ""The land where nothing grows"" is such a powerful phrase.",t3_kfuv8i
ggdj8pn,t3_kfuv8i,"You know you read too many horror stories when you guess  the next part. 

Seriously I had read the first two paragraphs and I put the phone down and I was thinking That you donâ€™t just tell kids to not do something you have to explain. Like things die if they enter the circle or things disappear if they enter the circle. I was thinking that the father and just needs to tell them that their dog went into the circle when they were a kid.  Then a picked my phone back up and read the next line â€œ one time my favorite dog ran into the circle â€œ .....   

Note saw a story on wholesome no sleep subscribed  to your sub Reddit. ðŸ˜Š",t3_kfuv8i

ggb1yp4,t1_ggb1ij8,"The land where nothing grows is mysterious, and nobody understands how or why it does what it does, but it seems to have a different effect on every living being that enters the circle.",t3_kfuv8i

C'mon, ain't you a writer?",t3_kfuv8i
ggfhsdu,t1_ggdjxsh,Oh I didnâ€™t mean it as negative feedback. There was lots of times that I can figure whatâ€™s gonna go on in the story. I simply thought about how I would explain it to my own kids if I had kids. I do think it was ingenious that he tried to avoid whatever it was by putting a plank over the dirt so I wasnâ€™t expecting the aging part. I have been spending the day reading your stories on and off and I do have other.... ideas.,t3_kfuv8i
