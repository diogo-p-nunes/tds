ggqrd5x,t3_kiej8j,"Sorry, but this isn’t a story. The main character isn’t  clear. Maybe he/she is the narrator? Who knows? And what’s doing? And why? 

This is a dialogue or a note. There’s no actions done. Without a character doing something we have not a story, just a note.

For the next one concentrare on

- a character
- what he wants
- what’s doing for that

It will help the construction of your story",t3_kiej8j
