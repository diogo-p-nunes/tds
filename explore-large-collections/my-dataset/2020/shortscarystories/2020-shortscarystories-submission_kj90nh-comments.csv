ggvjwvj,t3_kj90nh,"This is a well-crafted piece of writing; you’re not bad at all. I think what this Redditor means is plot-wise, he may need more resolution. Consider what a reaper and a doctor might have in common. 

Was the reaper, perhaps, angry at having lost a kill? That’s the sort of “payoff” or punchy-sort of resolution many readers look for in short-short form horror like this.",t3_kj90nh
ggvep17,t3_kj90nh,"This had such a promising start, but I felt the ending was anticlimactic.",t3_kj90nh
ggvkm1c,t1_ggvjwvj,"Thank you! I like your point about considering what the reaper and the doctor have in common. I definitely want to work on my endings, so this is a helpful tip!",t3_kj90nh
ggveze9,t1_ggvep17,I’m brand new to short stories. What kind of ending would you have liked?,t3_kj90nh
ggvkzn4,t1_ggvkm1c,"No problem. Happy to help. I used to teach writing at the State University of New York, so I only like to give positive feedback. :-)",t3_kj90nh
ggvg88k,t1_ggveze9,"It's just with all the build up and description of Randy's transformation (very good writing throughout btw), it just ended with him disappearing. There wasn't any resolution; what happened to the doc afterward?",t3_kj90nh
ggvlorz,t1_ggvkzn4,That’s really cool! I appreciate the encouragement. I’m going to take a class one of these days.,t3_kj90nh
ggvhm8j,t1_ggvg88k,Thank you for this feedback. I decided to leave the ending open in case I want to add to this story later. I still want to experiment with the ending some more.,t3_kj90nh
ggvoqyt,t1_ggvlorz,"Community colleges are terrific: auditing courses are free, and many of the professors I taught with were from the Ivy League — they preferred these places because they wanted to TEACH, not get into the “publish or perish” BS. (I wasn’t a professor; I’m a writer.)",t3_kj90nh
ggvje75,t1_ggvhm8j,Just so you know this sub doesn't allow continuations,t3_kj90nh
ggvjxv5,t1_ggvje75,"Thanks for telling me. If I continued it, I’d probably just do it for fun on my own.",t3_kj90nh
