gf7lzqv,t1_gf7i8x0,"Holy shit, that's where I grew up! This is actually based on a real thing that happened to me in high school. I didn't see anybody in the house, thank God, but otherwise it's true. I had snuck out to hang out with some friends in Joplin and got lost on my way back home, and while I was lost I came across a house completely on fire. But since it was 2009 I didn't have a smart phone or a good GPS, so when I called 911 they were like ""um we have no idea where you are either, we can't exactly send fire trucks without a location"" so I just watched this house burn down for awhile, then got back in my car and drove home. Couldn't exactly tell my parents about it since I didn't have a good reason to be out there, y'know?",t3_k9teep
gf7nsse,t1_gf7lzqv,"DUDE! I grew up in a little town called Blue Eye, down on the border of missouri and arkansas. That would have been scary as hell to see!!",t3_k9teep
gf7onfn,t1_gf7nsse,"Oh wow you were super close! Yeah I was an awkward closeted lesbian who never really fit in in that corner of Missouri, so I moved up to St Louis and I love it here. 


Oddly enough my teenage brain didn't register it as scary, it was so beautiful and isolated, and it was fully engulfed in flames by the time I saw it. So I just stood outside my car and watched it for awhile. Just thought ""damn, how has nobody else seen this yet?"" I actually hadn't thought about it in years until my brother brought up something that reminded me of it, and then it occurred to me how fucked up that whole encounter really was.",t3_k9teep
gf7tk97,t1_gf7onfn,"I ended up moving down to Florida, and I'm glad you found somewhere you feel safe and accepted :) 
I'm so curious about that house now...Great story, btw!!! Nice to meet you!",t3_k9teep
