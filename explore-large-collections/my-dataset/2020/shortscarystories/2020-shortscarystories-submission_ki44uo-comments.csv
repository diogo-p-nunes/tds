ggr3c04,t3_ki44uo,"I’m sorry, I just browsed through a bunch of your prior stories. Is this an AI-generated story or something? None of these make sense and have a very mechanic feel to them. 

If not, I would say the sentence structure could use some work. Also, the twist (is there a twist?) is lost on me.",t3_ki44uo

ggsatgn,t1_ggr3c04,"I've talked to this guy before. He make stories as a mental excercise. He does that just to remain creative, he doesn't care about grammar, plot twist, and other stuffs just pure ideas that are surreal. If you enjoy this then appreciate him, otherwise there are other users too you can read them. No hate here just telling you what I feel and know.",t3_ki44uo
ggsc9kw,t1_ggr3c04,"The way I saw it, the MC of this story is mentally challenged and his friend, who's an organ trafficker, is trying to convince him to donate parts of his brain (ig some parts of the brain sell really high on the black market).

The friend keeps lying to the MC to convince him to donate parts of his brains and the ones who return the organs prolly return them for some other reason and not because they're creeped out.",t3_ki44uo
ggtus6z,t1_ggsatgn,Oh! Maybe I should do that.,t3_ki44uo
gguzh1t,t1_ggsatgn,"Fair point, good to know. I guess the grammar/sentence structure kinda threw me off Since some of the concepts are unique and interesting, but if this is a mental exercise then I get that that’s less important for the writer. Thanks for clarifying",t3_ki44uo
