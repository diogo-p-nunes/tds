ghaui60,t3_kls2xq,"You should totally add more to this! Great beginning, but I want more!

Does the bear murder her whole family? Is it secretly a video camera so her uncle can kidnap her? Is the bear a demon? Give me more :D",t3_kls2xq
ghd4j5n,t3_kls2xq,"The story has potential if you add more, it's way too short but kudos you make it scary",t3_kls2xq
ghciybo,t3_kls2xq,I think uncle might be a bit of a pedophile...or Teddy is an alien scouting for the invasion...I liked it ...left me wanting more however...,t3_kls2xq
gi2y41x,t3_kls2xq,I have this thinking that teddy is human kinda like her brother or something,t3_kls2xq
ghcoaa9,t3_kls2xq,uncle has the horny for small human,t3_kls2xq
ghaw83j,t1_ghaui60,"Totally agree. The show-don’t-tell is excellent even if it’s a child talking. The scenario is really distressing and it can really be cool. I guess is more thrilling than horror, since Teddy acts more like an electronic system (well exposed, btw!).

I can imagine that you’re limited by the 500 words. If so and you expands, let us know in the comments.

Good job!",t3_kls2xq
ghdmxma,t1_ghaui60,My impression is that it is a high tech version of a nanny cam and the uncle is being a creep. The red eye can be like the red light a lot of electronics have.,t3_kls2xq
gheh0h8,t1_ghaui60,"I personally find it very intriguing that we don't know what Teddy is, what it's trying to do or were it came from, but I would love to see more nonetheless!",t3_kls2xq
