gfjwefv,t3_kbspgh,"If this violates any rules please let me know and I'll take it down myself. I tried to keep it as subtle as possible while still implying what was going on, but if it's not enough let me know and I'll work on it :)",t3_kbspgh

gfljfqp,t3_kbspgh,"Iâ€™m a #MeToo survivor, (8 y o), and was also beaten by Catholic priests and nuns as a kid (am female.) I approve this story, and have read sub rules; I know youâ€™re skirting them; I think itâ€™s worth it. Great job.  (Iâ€™m also a professional writer & novel editor.)",t3_kbspgh
gfmdl3z,t3_kbspgh,"Reminds me of the tongue demon of Outlast 2, loved this!",t3_kbspgh

gfp4c9d,t3_kbspgh,"Killed a priest at 11 eh .

gfljied,t3_kbspgh,"poor dude was just tryna help lol

gfmy85q,t3_kbspgh,I like how you wrote the end,t3_kbspgh
gfn2q0w,t3_kbspgh,Hey man this is an amazing story. Keep up the good work,t3_kbspgh
gfnmhvc,t3_kbspgh,This was great!,t3_kbspgh
gfnsjxg,t3_kbspgh,"Good job, my brain was making up images as I read, only good writers makes that happen. Very well written story! Keep it up.",t3_kbspgh
gfnw7hs,t3_kbspgh,"Nice job! Small typo, it should either be ""the Good Word"" or ""the word of God"" not ""the word of good""",t3_kbspgh
gfoe15v,t3_kbspgh,I appreciated that read. It was good,t3_kbspgh
gfopvpx,t3_kbspgh,I was just reading r/offmychest and I panicked when I saw this.,t3_kbspgh
gfp7n35,t3_kbspgh,This is a scary story!  A monster in life and a monster in death!  Chilling.,t3_kbspgh
gfpfxve,t3_kbspgh,Oh wow... this story is excellent!,t3_kbspgh
gfwx1kb,t3_kbspgh,"I can't believe this took so long to get to me, ahhh I hate it and love it at the same time, good job on your writing, the horror in this has nothing to do with subtleties or plot twists and that rarely is done well, so well done with understanding how to make a truly disturbing horror story.",t3_kbspgh
gg4qdlo,t3_kbspgh,"I'm curious about what Father Davis told 
 the kids though.",t3_kbspgh
gfoe310,t3_kbspgh,Yea! Fuck pedopriests!,t3_kbspgh
gfnhdb4,t1_gfjwefv,"As obvious as the priest reference may seem, throughout reading it, I kept waiting for you to make the reveal that it was something else going on that caused each child to return frightened.  By that, I mean that perhaps the priest had exposed the children to some dark arts or had been some creature who scared them intentionally to feed off of their fear in some sort of a twisted take on the Monsters Inc concept.  

I was not necessarily dissapointed with the vagueness of your story, but I do feel like you left enough room for people to create their own alternative theory to the immediate ""pedo priest"" thoughts.  

Good short scary story, my friend!  It still managed to veer into a different direction than I thought it would, and I liked it enough to read the comments and reply, lol.  I usually don't do that unless I like the story or feel like I have something witty to add.  I'll be looking out for your future additions to this sub!",t3_kbspgh
gfo7257,t1_gfjwefv,"Hi, paedophilia, even implied, is a no go - it would be easier if you made the reference to removing the demons or some dark magic/ritual stronger.",t3_kbspgh
gfjzb8w,t1_gfjyxuv,"Thanks! I'm hoping it doesn't violate any rules, I know the subject matter is iffy at best haha",t3_kbspgh
gflkeyi,t1_gfljfqp,"Thanks! I had one removed a few weeks ago but it was more graphic and blatent so that was fair. I was nervous about posting this one just in case.

I actually got banned for one of my stories for a bit until the mods reread it and realized I am not, in fact, a bigot.

I'm sorry that happened to you.",t3_kbspgh
gfpdcy0,t1_gfljfqp,You must be one *hell* of a strong person.,t3_kbspgh
gfmdvr7,t1_gfmdl3z,THAT WAS THE INSPIRATION I'm so glad someone else picked up on that haha,t3_kbspgh
gfll0ku,t1_gflgpyq,>!The father wasn't lying and he truly did came back as a demon!<,t3_kbspgh
gflxae4,t1_gflgpyq,He had been r@ping the children,t3_kbspgh
gg9p7lb,t1_gfn2q0w,Happy Cake Day!,t3_kbspgh
gfnmj40,t1_gfnmhvc,<3,t3_kbspgh
gfnwbgk,t1_gfnw7hs,"Ope just noticed that, nice catch",t3_kbspgh
gfnmi05,t1_gfnhdb4,"Thanks! I had one removed for inappropriate sexual themes (it was justified I'm not complaining) so with this one I didn't wanna be explicit at all, but still imply what's going on.",t3_kbspgh
gfpvjrb,t1_gfo7257,"Alright. Do you need me to edit this one or just keep that in mind for future stories?

I think this ones subtle enough where the reader could interpet the priest being a Satanist or doing dark magic, since theres no direct reference.

I don't want it to be removed, especially since a lot of people seem to be enjoying it.",t3_kbspgh
gfq19kb,t1_gfo7257,I edited it a tad (for his rituals) but I'm not sure what else I can do besides that. The only obvious implication is the title I guess.,t3_kbspgh
gfk6y4a,t1_gfjzb8w,Well done. Sometimes subtly is better than straight up saying it.,t3_kbspgh
gfn49am,t1_gfjzb8w,"Excellent story, glad to read this first thing in the morning....   :)",t3_kbspgh
gflpqgz,t1_gflkeyi,Thanks. Iâ€™m okay now. :-),t3_kbspgh
gfmqz49,t1_gflkeyi,You should post on r/nosleep,t3_kbspgh
gfmqtpy,t1_gflkeyi,This was creepy well done.,t3_kbspgh
gfnh27k,t1_gflkeyi,Did you post it elsewhere? Iâ€™d still like to read it. I was lucky enough to have a great child but was severely sexually abused by my ex husband so this one hit hard...but not in a bad way.,t3_kbspgh
gfod795,t1_gfmdvr7,Glad to know that someone else was as disturbed as I was after watching that game!take care and stay safe OP!,t3_kbspgh
gfnnbsu,t1_gflxae4,"Itâ€™s implied, but thatâ€™s not the twist part (which is that >!the priest really did become a demon!<)",t3_kbspgh
gfnmm4l,t1_gfnmj40,Keep it up,t3_kbspgh
gfq35eq,t1_gfq19kb,"Yes, thank you, this is better, but please remove the quotations on rituals. I know I sound pedantic, but I wouldn't want anyone else to cite this story in the future to let a story on paedophilia slide in.",t3_kbspgh
gfmhrd8,t1_gflpqgz,"As a survivor myself, I understand saying ""okay now"" means today.... never know about the next.   Hopefully you have a safe place now that you can use for comfort.  I'd never wish the fate on anyone.   Stay strong :)",t3_kbspgh
gfmr78h,t1_gfmqz49,"I post there sometimes. It's either stories over 500 words, or stories I've posted on here and then added to. Kind of a stepping stone writing pricess at the moment.",t3_kbspgh
gfnmafw,t1_gfnh27k,"It's in my little collection I'm making on google docs that (hopefully pls God) could get published. 
I'd try to post it somewhere else but honestly it's not a super great story. I don't think it's bad but it is definitely revolting and I couldn't argue when it got booted haha",t3_kbspgh
gfnolp9,t1_gfnnbsu,But what about the last part? Isn't it implied there's there's a second dead person OP is seeing?,t3_kbspgh
gfq3i9p,t1_gfq35eq,"No problem. It's annoying but I understand haha, that's why I was nervous about posting this one in the first place.

Thanks for being so cool about this!",t3_kbspgh
gfmp5zg,t1_gfmhrd8,Thanks; we get it.,t3_kbspgh
gfmxjti,t1_gfmr78h,Cool. That's very great for you.,t3_kbspgh
gfnopmv,t1_gfnolp9,Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s the same demon,t3_kbspgh
gfq4ld1,t1_gfq3i9p,"It's a huge sub, with lots of posts. 

Thanks for understanding!",t3_kbspgh
gfnorzo,t1_gfnopmv,That was quick! Also thanks!,t3_kbspgh
gfq54ow,t1_gfq4ld1,"Oh absolutely, I'm trying get in the habit of posting on here more often for practice/feedback, and having to follow rules helps develop that writing process.

Like getting the story in 500 words or less. It can be difficult to convey complicated ideas like that, but its part of the challenge.

You were a cool mod, I had one permaban me over a misunderstanding (it was overturned when I talked to them later, but still)",t3_kbspgh
gfq5mih,t1_gfq54ow,"Thanks! 

You can try r/DestructiveReaders. That sub is meant to give serious feedback.",t3_kbspgh
gfq5rfu,t1_gfq5mih,"Oh I've never heard of that one, thank you for the suggestion, thats exactly what I'm looking for",t3_kbspgh
