gh6heqr,t3_kis525,"I know that horror can often play fast-and-loose with biology for the sake of body horror but this really feels like you don’t understand what “reproduction” is or how it works. The twist at the end doesn’t really get proper build up because the reader is so distracted by trying to figure out what you are talking about. That is, I think the absurdity of the “reproduction” you’ve described detracts from the absurdity of the wife wanting their baby to have extra limbs. It would be a more shocking twist if the build up made sense. 

I also feel like this story could benefit a lot from better pacing. It reads as very repetitive with the “we reproduced.... we reproduced again.... etc.”

I say this not to be overly critical but because, again, I do think the core idea is interesting! But the execution just doesn’t work for me and I think it could benefit from thinking more about where you want the horror to come from (ie: is the horror the fact that these two reproduce in some weird alien way that allows them to add limbs to their child, or is the horror in the twist - the fact that the mother WANTS their child to be deformed? I think the horror gets lost if you try both, because if they’re not human in the way they reproduce why would we expect their baby to look human?)",t3_kis525
