gfyewit,t3_kdsw1l,"Don't drink and drive. There's plenty of options to avoid it as the Blonde points out to Matt before his demise. While the Blonde is a supernatural entity in the story, she essentially acts as Matt's voice of reason. He has a choice and despite multiple signs he shouldn't be doing what he's doing, he doesn't heed them. Additionally, if this sounds familiar, this is an old story of mine which used to be 275 words back when SSS had the smaller word count limit. I've expanded it to 500 words.

gfyiejk,t3_kdsw1l,"I work in a country pub and the customers regularly drink drive because it's very rare for the police to come out our way...but we stop serving them unless they hand over their car keys and if they refuse,we ring the police and report them. DRINK RESPONSIBLY AND DONT DRIVE OVER THE LIMIT!!",t3_kdsw1l
gfyis3q,t3_kdsw1l,Really well done. Love a good horror story with a spooky moral warning. The most ancient kind of public service announcements.,t3_kdsw1l

gfyy6sm,t1_gfyiejk,I’m writing a longer 1st person version for NoSleep and I address this as the establishment isn’t really all that classy and wouldn’t bother with caring about their customers. I’ve seen enough Bar Rescue to know these places exist lol. And great job with the pub you work at taking care of business. It’s good to know there’s places out there that give a shit about patrons.,t3_kdsw1l
