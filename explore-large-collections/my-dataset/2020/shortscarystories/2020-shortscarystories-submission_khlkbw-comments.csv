ggmgyof,t3_khlkbw,"I really like this. Just a small suggestion: when writing in this sort of form, be careful of sentences that cross too far into narrative writing. Things like

> My doorbell then shrieked, sending me to jump.  

is less like someone would post in a help forum and more like an actual story, so it sort of takes you out of the moment",t3_khlkbw
ggmfo36,t3_khlkbw,I truly thought this was posted in r/AskDocs and I was so concerned,t3_khlkbw

ggn7y2v,t3_khlkbw,So I was reading this at night and dropped my phone for a sec and the whole image of the white screen and all the black text stayed in my vision for a good few seconds which creeped me out. Great story OP hope you didn‚Äôt go back inside!,t3_khlkbw

ggnuqrt,t3_khlkbw,No such thing as coincidence.,t3_khlkbw
ggo2419,t3_khlkbw,Turn down the light on your phone screen. Dim it. Sounds like your screen is too bright. It‚Äôs like when you look at the sun for a quick second then for a short time everywhere you look there is a black dot in your field of vision. Same thing. However it‚Äôs also recommended that people see eye doctors more often. We only get one pair of eyes ya know ü•∞‚úåÔ∏è,t3_khlkbw

ggnyh9g,t1_ggn9t79,"Thank you, happy you liked it! But on a more serious tone, I did go to a doctor irl for this and nothing out of the ordinary was found. Just keep a watch in case anything drastic happens to your vision.",t3_khlkbw
