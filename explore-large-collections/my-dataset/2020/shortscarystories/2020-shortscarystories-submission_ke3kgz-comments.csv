gg09bw0,t3_ke3kgz,Nicely done!,t3_ke3kgz
gg4a7gz,t3_ke3kgz,"This was really good. I think the whole ""imposter/mimic"" idea has been played with a lot lately, but I enjoy stories like this where the creature can actually trick your mind into accepting it. 

I like that you say, ""we laughed. Dave wasn't amused."" At first I thought it was a typo, but it was actually like the tiniest foreshadowing before revealing Tom. Love it.",t3_ke3kgz

gg1g8ze,t1_gg1flde,"“Tom” was never mentioned elsewhere in the story- see paragraph one, where it only mentions “the two of us”. “Tom” is the parasite.",t3_ke3kgz
