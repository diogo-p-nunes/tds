gg4jbsi,t1_gg4cw3f,"Or are his limbs rotating which afterlife he goes to based on how he's living? 

I envisioned something like that, yes. OR it's all just in his imagination, his phantom pain being just psychosomatic reactions of his guilty subconciousness (i don't want to reduce actual phantom pain victims to ""it's just in their head""; it's actually based on nerve damage as far as we know; but it fits to our protagonist)

Either way now he has a road to salvation, potentially at least. A guilty conciousness, fear of punishment (hell) and a rigid road for penance can lead you down another dark path as well however.",t3_kcvi2j
