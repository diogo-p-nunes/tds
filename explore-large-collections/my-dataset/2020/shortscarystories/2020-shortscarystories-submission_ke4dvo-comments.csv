gg0gpic,t3_ke4dvo,"I htink I'm going to need an explanation for this one.

/u/criterion_infection, please respond.",t3_ke4dvo
gg0sp3n,t3_ke4dvo,"I feel like this needs a part two to fully explain, but I enjoyed this concept/writing more than most stuff I’ve seen on this sub in a while.  

I like the setup where you say “different place” instead of better place. The whole piece feels like we’re just peeking in on a much bigger story.",t3_ke4dvo
gg0lf0f,t3_ke4dvo,I like it but I don’t get it,t3_ke4dvo
gg0d0n5,t3_ke4dvo,Huh?,t3_ke4dvo
gg0n6r1,t3_ke4dvo,please explain,t3_ke4dvo
gg3ex7n,t3_ke4dvo,"Tbh I like this quite a lot even without the explanation, the vague ending leaves much to the imagination!",t3_ke4dvo
gggaebn,t3_ke4dvo,"I think it’s fairly clear— unlike some stories on this sub, which unfortunately misunderstand the technique, and instead of SUGGESTING & directing the ending for the reader to fill in themselves (which can lead to fun debates, & lots of thought), rookie writers end up asking readers to WRITE the ending. 

Here (IMHO), the protagonist horrifyingly discovers the uncle’s art is a clue to his father’s passionate commitment to some Lovecraftian, multigenerational horror, which MAY (or may not) mean the protagonist may himself be transformed into some next-Gen version of the coiled/uncoiled beast he sees his father represented as in his uncle’s artwork. 

TL; DR: the story hints heavily that the protagonist may end up in real-life like his father was in his uncle’s painting—only maybe farther along in “The Uncoiling.” (Shiver)",t3_ke4dvo
gg2z4g5,t1_gg0gpic,"A guy's maternal uncle dies, and he's the uncle's only living relative, so he inherits all the uncle's property. His uncle and he weren't close, but he used to go to his house before his mother and he moved away. He hated going there because his uncle's art scared him. His mother told him that his uncle was just an art collector before eventually telling him the truth, which is that she was in a cult with him called the Coiled Ascent, and the art was inspired by their beliefs. The mother died without going into detail.

At his uncle's burial, a friend of the uncle comes up to him and asks if she can take something from the house. He's unnerved by all of his uncle's possessions and says that she can take whatever she wants. When she arrives, he asks her to explain the meaning of a disturbing painting, and she tells him that the  half–horseshoe crab, half-primate entity in the painting is a flatman, and the tree, wind, and aurora represent obstacles on the coiled ascent. He realizes that the woman was in the same cult was his mother and uncle and knows who he is.

She offers to show him pictures, and his curiosity gets the better of him. The pictures show his uncle's progression in the occult from playing with a mass-produced toy to written backwards on a mirror in blood, presumably for the convenience of whatever's reading on the other side. She goes on to tell him that his uncle just wanted to fit in, but his dead father, who took the pictures,  was his uncle's college roommate and the one who got him into the Coiled Ascent. She takes him back to the painting with a picture of his father, and he can see that the flatman has his father's face. She tells him that the Coiled Ascent is a multi-generational project, and, although he doesn't understand the implications, he he sees the flatman and his perils and is afraid.

It's unclear if the flatman is a metaphor, or physically becoming a flatman is part of the ascent. The meaning of the ascent and coils is never explained.",t3_ke4dvo
gg2zowu,t1_gg0sp3n,"Thanks! One of the things that I like best about this sub's restrictions is the challenge of telling a complete and satisfying story while also hinting at something larger. It's a difficult balance to strike, but I always have fun trying.",t3_ke4dvo

gg3994i,t1_gg2zowu,"You didn't do a bad job. However, it does seem like it confused everyone who read it, myself included.",t3_ke4dvo
gg3939i,t1_gg2z79x,You should really flesh it out and post it to a sub that doesn't have a character limit.,t3_ke4dvo
gg3601t,t1_gg2z8sn,ok I'll find it thanks,t3_ke4dvo
gg3snfk,t1_gg3939i,"Honestly, the word count wasn't a limiting factor. I managed to fit everything that I wanted into the story, albeit obliquely. I don't have anymore answer than you do about the protagonist's fate or the coiled ascent. I have a lot of recurring themes, though, so a sort of organic mythology might eventually grow out of stories like this.",t3_ke4dvo
