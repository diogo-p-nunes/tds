Just wondering since it got the same core idea.",t3_k9kwfn

gf6jc5k,t1_gf5pbxj,"Thanks a mill! Haha yeah, 2020 has been a drag. But eff the Gray Goo, we‚Äôre gonna persevere.",t3_k9kwfn

gfb2igu,t1_gfb06d4,"I'm so glad you like the descriptions! Writing for ShortScaryStories has been super fun because you have to be so economical with the prose ‚Äì‚Äì it's really teaching me how to get to the point and not drag out descriptions; provide some visual pieces to work with and let readers fill in most of it with their imagination. 

I'm excited to keep writing and submitting here. If you're interested in reading more, check out my subreddit: [WestCoastDerry](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestCoastDerry/).

gfbq0j8,t1_gfbmpw7,"Haha no idea. I‚Äôm better at this the fiction part than the science part. Also terrible at math. But if someone needs messed up horror imagery, I‚Äôm your huckleberry!",t3_k9kwfn
gf55a7i,t1_gf54ze0,Finding yourself so utterly alone would be terrifying.,t3_k9kwfn
gf6yeyu,t1_gf6y481,"Pardon my assumption then! This is cool stuff after all. 

The BM is all about human create plastic-eating creature to be a livestocks, while solving over-landfilling at the same time.  But unfortunately they were let loose so the city face your kind of demise.",t3_k9kwfn
gf6z6p8,t1_gf6yeyu,"No pardon required! The Gray Goo scenario is pretty well-established, I didn‚Äôt make that part up. I‚Äôm going to check out BM, it sounds awesome. Japanese horror is fantastic, I love how creative it is. 

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of Uzumaki but if you haven‚Äôt, check it out. I read a ton of horror and that one is right up alongside anything Stephen King has ever written, and he‚Äôs my idol.",t3_k9kwfn
gf6zf81,t1_gf6z6p8,Sure will do!,t3_k9kwfn
