gesaypp,t3_k7nvgn,"sorry, im kinda dumb rn, i dont get it?",t3_k7nvgn
get1saf,t3_k7nvgn,"You had a few errors, you spelled tick and rock in a weird way, and it kinda seems like English isnâ€™t your first language, but itâ€™s still really good. Kinda wish there was an ending though.",t3_k7nvgn
gesb3od,t1_gesaypp,It's alright if you don't get it. It's up for the reader to interpretate what's it's about.,t3_k7nvgn
get36lz,t1_get1saf,"Lol, actually English is my first language but it's an old story I wrote back in 2015. 

I think I was planning to finish the story but never did. Sorry if you wanted an ending. ðŸ˜…",t3_k7nvgn
get45lv,t1_get36lz,"Nono itâ€™s fine. Some of the mistakes just seemed like tricky things for a non-English speaker, like changes in tense and punctuation errors and spelling Tick Tock like the app.

Honestly after reading it a couple of times it doesnâ€™t need an ending. The title suggests that it could be something you hear from the room next door one night, so of course the reader wouldnâ€™t be getting the whole story.",t3_k7nvgn
get4muh,t1_get45lv,"Exactly, Thank you ðŸ¥°. 

Also, yeah. My English is shit even if I'm Australian ðŸ¤£",t3_k7nvgn
