gh7jlow,t3_kl8csd,"I think this would be a good writing prompt like a zombie viruses you get turned into giant moths.

However I would like it more if 

1.the moths didnt eat each other but rather humans and when the humans die theyll start eating the buildings and man-made structures then they'll turn to be omnivores and it spread by bites

2. the metemorphasis would just be you turning into a cacoon and growing wings antenna and that stuff

3. The moths carry children back to there ""hive""  where they turn into more advanced moths",t3_kl8csd

Come visit us at [WestCoastDerry](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestCoastDerry/)! It's a real hoedown hootenanny.",t3_kl8csd
gh7kcis,t1_gh7jlow,"Ooooooo awesome idea. Yeah I didnâ€™t think through the moth behavior as much as I could have. Itâ€™s also a lot to pack into 500 words, sort of an interesting challenge but could definitely be expanded into a longer format. 

Iâ€™m going to think on it! Library of Shadows might be an interesting place for something like that.",t3_kl8csd

gh7o9u2,t1_gh7lv4j,"Iâ€™m still pretty new to Reddit and the short story game. My natural mode is actually longer form/world building...just takes so damn long ðŸ˜‚

I love your idea though, I can picture moth people chewing buildings to shreds in my mind. Very David Cronenberg.",t3_kl8csd
gh7ofhg,t1_gh7o9u2,And then like regurgitating it like wasps to keep building there hive. *But whose the queen?* That would be the main plot,t3_kl8csd
gh801jz,t1_gh7ofhg,Loooooove it ðŸ¦Ÿ,t3_kl8csd
