gel074q,t3_k6ghud,So ...she was talking about herself?,t3_k6ghud
gekp1y2,t3_k6ghud,Nice good job frick her lol,t3_k6ghud
geztzrs,t3_k6ghud,Dang. So twisted. Maybe some apologies would be better than hanging yourself.,t3_k6ghud
gel30et,t1_gel074q,"Yes! Sorry if it was a bit confusing, i haven't written that many stories yet :'D",t3_k6ghud
gekp3td,t1_gekp1y2,Thanks :D,t3_k6ghud
gel5c1d,t1_gel30et,The story was amazing :) . And I dont think it was confusing...theres this part of me which is fixed on murder=horror which is why I got confused,t3_k6ghud
geo0oia,t1_gel30et,I actually think that it is better slightly confusing because at first I was thinking “oh so op is gonna kill her” and then it hits me like a train and the whole story makes so much more sense.,t3_k6ghud
gel5gb0,t1_gel5c1d,Ahh thanks again!! I really appreciate what you said :D and okay!,t3_k6ghud
geog30c,t1_geo0oia,Good point!,t3_k6ghud
geog7sj,t1_geog30c,Yeah man. The best way to describe it is instead of the twist being in the story it’s almost like the twist comes after the story. Good job man,t3_k6ghud
geog9jo,t1_geog7sj,Thanks!,t3_k6ghud
gf1ku3x,t1_geog7sj,That's true :),t3_k6ghud
