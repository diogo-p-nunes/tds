gfuz22z,t3_kd28gk,"I'm pretty sure that's where the term comes from.  If someone broke the pinky promise, they lost their pinky.",t3_kd28gk
gfu979j,t3_kd28gk,This is amazing,t3_kd28gk
gfwj8m6,t3_kd28gk,"> The first time I remember her lying to me was when she pinky promised to me that she'd give me back my Pokémon card.

gfvu3iw,t3_kd28gk,Jenny deserved it,t3_kd28gk
gfvu7ij,t3_kd28gk,Isn't it against the rules to put links in your post? Should move it to the comments just in case,t3_kd28gk
gfxqt2d,t3_kd28gk,Love it,t3_kd28gk
gfvxeon,t1_gfvu7ij,I don’t think so. I think you can’t post link to outside websites,t3_kd28gk
gfwhi56,t1_gfvu7ij,"If it is discreet and hidden in the text like this, then that is ok",t3_kd28gk
gfvxokn,t1_gfvxeon,"No, links to personal subreddits go in the comments, per rule 10",t3_kd28gk
gfxsvh6,t1_gfwhi56,"That's /r/NoSleep. In /r/ShortScaryStories, links to personal subreddits MUST be in the comment section.",t3_kd28gk
gfvyd3q,t1_gfvxokn,"“linking to social media (Facebook, Twitter, ect) and fundraising websites (Patreon, GoFundMe, ect) and personal websites are NOT allowed”.

and plus it say you “MAY post a link to a personal subreddit”",t3_kd28gk
gfvygyb,t1_gfvyd3q,"IN THE COMMENTS, FAM. I never said you couldn't post at all, I said they should go in the comments, like that rule literally says, ""strictly in the Comments""",t3_kd28gk
gfvylzx,t1_gfvygyb,"I know!!, I am just saying they it isn’t against the rules",t3_kd28gk
gfvyph6,t1_gfvylzx,"Yes I know, but it is against the rules to put links inside the story/post itself",t3_kd28gk
gfvyu8b,t1_gfvyph6,"Bro it say “Outside Website”, but hey who knows.",t3_kd28gk
gfvzpxj,t1_gfvyu8b,Bruh...I give up. It explicitly says personal subreddits should go in the comments only. But have a nice day.,t3_kd28gk
gfvzsqm,t1_gfvzpxj,Yay you to,t3_kd28gk
