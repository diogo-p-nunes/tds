gfv4s0u,t3_kd9d81,"*All I want for Christmas is the decomposing remains of my severed leg*. We‚Äôve all been there I‚Äôm sure. Such a classic, really. And who‚Äôs Santa to deny such a wholesome request? He‚Äôs probably got piles of the rotting things lying around anyway.

You should pitch this to Hallmark After Dark.",t3_kd9d81
gfvs6wj,t3_kd9d81,"I... could see myself as that Santa quite honestly. Perhaps I would have gotten it stuffed instead? ~~of course that would require time travel~~ I‚Äôll get back to you, Charlie. But happy Hanukkah!

Hyper. You really ought to do something about your word choice, it‚Äôs just absolutely too perfect. Like your mind. Loved this one! Seasons‚Äô greetings! Ding dong! Am I a carol or someone leaving a mysterious (mouldering) package on your porch? Either way, don‚Äôt peek ‚Äòtil ~~the stench is overwhelming~~ Christmas! :D",t3_kd9d81

gfy64xn,t3_kd9d81,"Excellently written!  

I thought that she had asked for a house fire to kill her parents, and the smell of the smoke awakened her.

When that didn‚Äôt happen and it said that it was the right weight, I thought that it was a gun and she was going to kill her abusive father with it since he‚Äôs the one who was questioning her.

So your twist really got me.  Well done!",t3_kd9d81
