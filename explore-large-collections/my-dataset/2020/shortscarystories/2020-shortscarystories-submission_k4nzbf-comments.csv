gebw0mg,t3_k4nzbf,"Great story!! This is a nice twist.  My name is actually Amanda, and I've always heard the A-man-duhh jokes.  Very clever!",t3_k4nzbf
geb7jju,t3_k4nzbf,Nicely done!,t3_k4nzbf
gebjoqh,t3_k4nzbf,"Holy moly, thank goodness my name can‚Äôt be mistaken for anything bc our son calls us (husband and I) both by our first names randomly. This was a great twist OP I loved it!",t3_k4nzbf
gecdvx9,t3_k4nzbf,My name is Amanda and I approve this story,t3_k4nzbf
gecc1q9,t3_k4nzbf,I called my mom by her first name for a while as a toddler because that‚Äôs what other people were calling her. It drove my grandma and great-grandma crazy apparently but my mom thought it was funny.,t3_k4nzbf
gebd0s9,t3_k4nzbf,Masterpiece:3,t3_k4nzbf
gec0nez,t3_k4nzbf,Damn!  That got me!,t3_k4nzbf

gebvyq1,t3_k4nzbf,"If my kid said my name that clearly at 18 months, I would jump up and down in excitement.",t3_k4nzbf
gegpfrc,t3_k4nzbf,WOW this one is super good!! :o,t3_k4nzbf
geh353u,t3_k4nzbf,"What a twist! I thought for sure the toddler was going to a demon, or something.",t3_k4nzbf
gei4ujy,t3_k4nzbf,You know a story is good when it's scary *and* it makes you laugh. Well done!,t3_k4nzbf
geo3l2s,t3_k4nzbf,"Brilliant! This gave me serious shivers. Hope the poor woman was, at least, on her second glass.",t3_k4nzbf
gec81fa,t3_k4nzbf,This made me literally turn around and turn all the lights on. My god.,t3_k4nzbf
geca89l,t3_k4nzbf,I didn't expect that damn,t3_k4nzbf
gecbzgz,t3_k4nzbf,Nice one,t3_k4nzbf
gee7tld,t3_k4nzbf,Fake. The story starts with a mother of a 1.5 year old and she's sitting reading a book and drinking wine. Impossible.,t3_k4nzbf
gebhkz2,t3_k4nzbf,"Nice story and good twist.
But i felt like it gave too much importance to the name thing. Anyone who's been around kids know they have a phase where they call parents by names or nicknames, they are just repeating what they hear everyone else call their parents and testing it. She could just have laugh it off and tried to correct him over and over instead of thinking mental illnes and that deep stuff lol, it would have felt more natural.

Edit: autocorrector in portuguese changed some words and i didnt realized.",t3_k4nzbf
gebsb0x,t1_geann25,Definition of a tired parent,t3_k4nzbf

gece9bj,t1_gecdvx9,"A story about Amanda, by Amanda, for Amandas :)",t3_k4nzbf
gegsvq3,t1_gegpfrc,thank you!! üíóüíóüíó,t3_k4nzbf
gebowh4,t1_gebhkz2,"I think her being scared is important though. It sets the reader up to expect there to be something wrong with the baby‚Äîlike he‚Äôs a demon/ghost/etc . I‚Äôm definitely aware kids go through those phases but I wasn‚Äôt thinking this while reading a short scary story. The main character was scared of him for a moment so I was scared of him for a moment.


The narrator made my mind focus on the boy being scary so the twist hit that much harder!",t3_k4nzbf
gebsgzo,t1_gebsb0x,"I‚Äôm dying! Not a parent, but (even though it‚Äôs barely scratching the surface) I babysit and I know that feeling all too well",t3_k4nzbf
gecg5pn,t1_gebsb0x,"Not really definition of being a tired parent, sometimes from fear or adrenaline your body basically shuts down you enough to still feel pain but not as bad and you won‚Äôt react as badly. Basically you could be punched in the face and instead of yelling ‚ÄúOW SHIT‚Äù you could calmly say ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù",t3_k4nzbf
gedxmr7,t1_gebsb0x,good night.,t3_k4nzbf

gec9kq2,t1_gebw7dg,"One of my ESL students made a praying motion and said, ""Amen-daaaaaa!""",t3_k4nzbf
gebsr9u,t1_gebsgzo,"Not a parent as well, but I used to babysit a lot and have nieces and nephews. I couldn't even imagine how it is to be around it 24/7",t3_k4nzbf
gebst37,t1_gebsr9u,Oh gosh don‚Äôt make me think about that,t3_k4nzbf
