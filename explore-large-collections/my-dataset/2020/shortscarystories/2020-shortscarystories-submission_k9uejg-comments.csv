gf6eq0z,t3_k9uejg,"/u/atwproductions, I have found some errors in your post:

 > “horrible, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like a scream”

 > “~~Its~~ [**It's**] about the people”

It might be better if you, atwproductions, had said “horrible, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like a scream” and “~~Its~~ [**It's**] about the people” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.
