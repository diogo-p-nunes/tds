Me: Why? Is it because I am destroying you at air hockey 

Andrew: what no... It just I am going to college and I want to have one last picture with you before I go

Me: Fine! 

*Arrive that the photo booth* 

Andrew: Say cheese 

*He put his arm around me*

*We went out, and I grab the tickets*

Me: All right let’s see (expect him to do a funny face or giving me bunny ears). Wait why... Why aren’t you showing? Oh yay..

I tear the picture up and went back to playing air hockey alone and went back and fore to get the puck.

That’s is why I hate going to the photo booth, Because it always reminds me of taking my last picture with him and reminding me how truly alone I am."

I have failed you, mother. I have failed you, father. Your worthless son can't kill a monster like he. 

Soon, the village will grieve. Soon, the mourning bells will ring. They will ring for many days and then stop. For there will be none left to ring them. No one will be left alive. 

 The village will be empty and the bodies will never rot. 
Days will be silent and the night will echo with footsteps of the starving hordes of pale hands and what should not live. And a red river will flow across the land.

I can hear the sounds of what will come to pass. In my nightmares, I see his dreams. He stands alone in my nightmares, *my failure*. He is the root of the unrot. The night that has a face. 

The race will run scurrying into the blackness where it came. 

They will all be like him and he will be all. 

But first, the children will die. *Yes, soon, the children must die*

My heart is already cold. Tonight holds my final chance to stop the monster, but it feels so lost already. 


I could feel  it growing closer, the moment of confrontation.
My path to the village is alone tonight. They have learnt to stay in after dark

There are flickering lights in the windows, even as it grows late and it hurts the sleeping eyes. *But that is only natural for them.*

*All things are afraid of what cannot be seen. That is why they destroy the dark. But there is always a darkness that will never be illuminated. No candle can extinguish the shadow right behind you. What is always with you, is your personal darkness.*

I see the open window, by the woods. My hands shiver in the cold as I am drawn near. I know this is where it will take place. Where he will be. Where we will meet.

A great oak leads me to our meeting place. The  branches part and give way to the scene of final confrontation once more. I stare into a child's bedroom

Across me, is a dresser with child's mirror. I look into the mirror and no one stares back. The child is sleeping as we knock on the glass."

I’ve been climbing for a week. The way up to the top is rough and steep, but beautiful fields lie just beyond the top. The view of a lifetime. I just have to survive the climb. 


Switchbacks stopped occurring a few miles ago; the mountain got so steep that even added them would have defeated the purpose. I’ve been walking, stumbling, camping, and sleeping in incline for days now. 


It’s so hard. My legs are so sore, blisters cover my feet, my head is constantly pounding, but I know I can’t stop climbing. If I stop, I might lose the will to go on, I might consider those beautiful fields not worth the trip, I might not want to put in the work that precedes the good things in life. 


And so I keep climbing. I’ve slipped and tumbled a few times now, no broken bones yet, although my nose is busted up. Blood fills my boots, from the constant rubbing of blisters. Water has been low for days, I’ve been boiling ice that I scrounge around. 


I’m not sure why I’m still climbing. I know it’s only been about a week but it feels closer to a month. I haven’t seen another hiker in days, they all must have considered this path too dangerous this time of year. I wanted an adventure, but now I’m not so sure. 


I’ve started seeing things, too. Formless shapes in the distance, yelling at me to wake up when I lie down to rest, telling me I have to keep going. 


Despite the encouragement, they terrify me. They all sound familiar, but I can’t place them. I feel I’ve seen their faces also, but I can’t make them out, like they’ve been censored on a television or something. I‘m afraid if I stop, the things will catch up to me. 


And so I keep climbing. Despite how tired I am; despite how much I hurt and ache. 


I need to see what happens when I get to the top......




“How long has he been out, doctor?” Priscilla asked, worry filling her face. 

“A few days. He had a rough fall from the mountain, he should never have been out climbing this late in the season.” The doctor said, in a tone that was both pitiful and scornful. “He has differing levels of action. Sometimes his blood pressure and pulse speed up, sometimes they slow down. It’s like he still thinks he’s hiking.” 


Priscilla stared at her fathers battered body, tubes coming out all around him to keep him functioning, and began to cry. She wondered what her father was going through; what it’d be like to be comatose, unaware of the world around you, but still physically alive. 


She worried he was in pain or scared, but the doctor dismissed her fears. Even he didn’t know what comatose people think about, if they think at all."
knzokz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/knzokz/tictactoe/,Tic-Tac-Toe,243,10,1609454360.0,"Chess is a drawn game.

Believe it or not, if two perfect chess players faced each other, without making a single mistake throughout the entire game...

They'd draw. Every single time. They'd be locked in a battle endlessly, trying to find out who the better of the two was.

That's why tic-tac-toe is the kindergarten counterpart of chess. it's drawn. The only difference between the two when it comes to ordinary people is that one's a marathon, and the other's a sprint.

Funny how the one with less moves is the marathon.

It's something that I learned early on. Most people who I went up against would try to outplay me, psyching me out with a move that might confuse me temporarily, but would screw them over in the long run.

Putting the x in some spot other than the middle? Never seen that before!

Some would go a step further when that didn't work and we're 30 games in without a victor. with words that tried to cut into me. But that was their fatal error...

With all of their trash-talking, they'd make a mistake, and I would take the win.

This is where they'd shut up, and painstakingly analyze every single move that we'd both make. 

That's their second mistake.. It's tic-tac-toe, not chess. Putting too much thought into what you do will make you miss a simple little column or row, especially when we're 10 or 20 games in, you're bound to slip up eventually when you play like that..

2-0. They're panicking now, and really stepping up the inspection game. But they forget about the little clock in the corner, ticking away their move time. And it rings the bell, signalling their final loss.

The sweat beads down their head as realization dawns on them, that it's over. They plead to me, but I don't know what that would do, I'm in the same predicament. But the fear in their eyes is clearer than their sloppiness.

The guards haul them away, through their screams and hollers. They beg them to not do this, but they knew what they were getting into. ""A game of tic-tac-toe? This'll be some easy money!"" Must have brushed over the less savoury parts of the contract.

As I hear the gun fire in the next room, and the sound of the blood and guts splatter against the walls, I think to myself...

""Winning these games is as easy as tic-tac-toe."""

She was frilly and blue in her spotty swimsuit, and she wailed in uncomprehending dismay.

I doubled down. *You want to cry?*

I kicked sand in her eyes.

I raced on past, and flung a woman’s scarf into her face. Wooly fuzzy felted tassels, splayed in disarray. She gasped in surprise, her friend laughed. I made haste.

&#x200B;

Ladies hold their skirts down when I'm around. They laugh at my antics, if I time it right. I've made you laugh before I bet!

&#x200B;

Oh, but I have a temper. A hideous temper. Catch me in the wrong place, the wrong time, and I’ll wipe you out.

I wail at night. I wail to keep you awake, to scare you, to warn you.

Stay indoors. Burrow underground, I’m coming for you. Don’t come out till I’ve passed.

You watch me closely, you study me. You predict me, but I’m not entirely predictable.

I sleep a lot too.

&#x200B;

You need me. Your international industries, your thrill-seeking maniacs, your unconscious and hard-wired urge to explore afar, across the sea.

I am in service to you.

We make music, you and I, when you’re not even around to hear it. You give me the voice-box to sing, wooden and clanking on your porch.

I even have a conscience, too. I tried to save a life today. But for all my awesome, eye-blinding, land-whipping power, I failed.

I’ve failed before, and I’ll fail again.

I’ve met him before, this man. I’ve watched him climb from his car, firm in intention, but he always retreats to the bosom of the city. He always changes his mind, just at the right time.

&#x200B;

But not today.

&#x200B;

I know his name. He knows I’m watching.

He found it tranquil here, on this precipice of the sea-cliff, but for all the wrong reasons. He stood on the grassy edge. Like me, he feels exhausted sometimes.

Too many times.

I roared at him.

*Go back!* I thunder. *Go back, go back, go back!*

I shoved him in full force towards the hills, but he stood steadfast. He closed his eyes.

&#x200B;

He was at peace.

&#x200B;

He opened his arms to me, his futile last frontier, and stepped into the void.

He slipped from my grasp.

Gravity’s eternal, dumb, unconscious grip yanked him to the Earth’s core.

The sea rocks broke his fall.

&#x200B;

*The seabirds all dipped down on my arms*

*Wailing aloud at his mangled form.*

*I am the wind.*

*Heed my tale,*

*For I summon the seas to the sky when I mourn.*"

Thank you so so much! Your stories however dark they may have been one of the few things that kept me going this awful year. Your creativity and imagination that churned out wonderful thrillers daily kept me engrossed and made me await the next day for a new batch of gore ridden, horrific posts that always gave me the chills. The Conjuring? The Nun? Derivative works whose only redeeming factor was the jump scares, the sound, and the visuals. But none could hold a candle to the goosebump-inducing pleasure your stories have given me.

But enough of me rambling on. I will cut to the chase. As a token of gratitude, I have sent you all gifts. Do open them up with your family. They are of several varieties. Some of you will receive the most hilarious gags which will certainly make you laugh till your jaws ache (and hopefully not fall off). Some of you will get some of my most exquisite handcrafted ornaments which will surely put a smile on your face....for eternity. Some of you may receive a rare pet from my adventures. Just ensure that they are well fed with human flesh. They have odd tastes, alien looks, and abilities but are truly the most loyal companions to whoever provides them the meat.  Lucky ones will get a golden flashlight (lamps are so outdated) that grants a wish to whomever you shine it at. Just word it very, very carefully.

But all in all, enjoy these humble presents with family and friends, and hope you have a wonderful 2021!"

I moved this morning for an excursion on the countryside around a little town in Germany, where I am located now ‘cause of COVID restrictions.

I decided to exit a bit from the path and move to the forest to have a leak. A small bright point attires my attention after the... well, you understand.

The light was a reflection made by a piece of iron exposed from a concrete wall. Really old concrete.

It was a old bunker. Not some
Nazi stuff, but from the Soviet period.

I was thrilled. A tour in a place like that would have been the perfect way to end this shitty year! The door was rusty and fell when I tried to open it.

The main corridor was dark and I walk though it, well intended to reach the lowest point. I reached a stair and I went down.

One floor.

Two.

Three.

The lowest was the seventh and I was thrilled, ‘cause I start from the fifth to hear a strange humming and to be able to see ‘cause of a feeble red light.

I was breathless when I saw the end.

A red gate covered of figures, big enough to allow a bus to pass was in front of me. A skeleton in a uniform was in front of it.

«Pestilence did his work» said a deep voice from the portal. «Now is time of Famine»

Well, 2020 was shitty enough. I removed the skeleton and now I am with my shoulder against this portal. 

I hope my sacrifice will keep it closed.

And I hope 2021 will be better for you all."

My wife didn't see the humour but my kids had a good laugh about it. When I closed the door my youngest child pressed the door bell. As she pressed the door bell someone on the outside (a stranger) opened the door even though it was fully locked. We were all shocked. 


""Hello can I help you?"" This person asked us 


""Why did you ring the door bell?"" The stranger asked us but we gave no answer as we were all shocked


""I don't like pranksters so stop ringing the door bell!"" The stranger shouted at us


I then put more door bells inside my bedroom door and did the same for my children's bedroom doors but on the inside. When I pressed the door bell inside my bedroom door, that same stranger would open the door as if it was his house and he shouted at me saying ""you again stop pressing the door bell!"" And my kids were also pressing the door bell which I built inside their bedrooms. I will be honest my kids were enjoying it a bit too much.


They would constantly press the door bell inside their bedroom doors and the stranger who opens the door was getting more angrier each time and started threatening us. Whenever this stranger closed the door, he would be no where to be seen when I went out to look for him. I made like a necklace doorbell and my eldest child wore it around her neck. When my youngest child pressed the door bell around my eldest child's neck, that same stranger opened up her chest like it was a door. 


""Right that's it I've had it!"" The stranger shouted and he then grabbed my youngest child and took her with him as he closed my eldest child's chest. I couldn't believe what I had witnessed. I have been trying to ring every door bell which I fixed on the insides of every door in my house, this stranger isn't answering anymore. 


My eldest daughter then shouted that she could feel her younger sister banging against her chest inside her own body. I could feel it as well and a little scream. What have I done. "

""Lightning crisscrossed the sky, illuminating the town centre where the boy was tied to an old wooden post. The wolves circled the terrified teen as The Skeleton King approached him, relishing the ritual that was to come. The zombie crowd started to chant, as the skeleton king slowly raised his hand, which was just yellowed putrid bones, and placed it over the boy's chest, ready to pull his still-beating heart right out from behind his ribcage...""

The child giggled, breaking the storyteller’s focus. 

""Really?” He asked, thrown by the girl's laughter. “That's meant to be terrifying, you know.”

The child giggled even louder.

“Hush, hush, little one… you’re too loud!”

It was too late. The bedroom door opened, and the child’s annoyed mother looked in at the girl. “What did I tell you about playing with your torch to make shadows after bedtime?” The child meekly apologised, but the woman was unfazed. “If it happens one more time, I'm taking that away. Now - go to sleep!”

The door closed. There was a deathly silence in the room, finally broken by the storyteller. ""You do need to get enough sleep, little one. You have school in the morning”. 

""There are so many rules!” the child whispered petulantly. “It’s boring!”

The storyteller sighed. “You're going to discover that life's not always fair..."" 

The child became sullen. “I don’t like her.”

The storyteller tried to dissuade the child, but she was insistent. He gazed down at the precocious child on the bed, knowing she had made up her mind. Still, he had to be sure. 

“Do you want me to make her and your Daddy go away?” He hoped that saying it aloud would make the child reconsider. ""Are you sure you want them... dead?""

The child didn’t hesitate. ""Yes""

“That means a new mummy and daddy,” the storyteller clarified. 

""Uh-huh""

The storyteller sighed. “OK. I'll do it in the morning when you're in school. I will be quick; they won’t suffer, I promise.""

""Thank you.""

The child’s smile melted the storyteller’s heart, but he still had to point out what might not have been obvious to the child. “My little angel, this will be the third time in two years... someone might be suspicious. Promise me you'll try harder this time to fit in?”"

Up ahead, against the side of the store was a dumpster, with a shoulder-height wall wrapped around the space. On the other side of the wall, Officer Conrad had been told, was a squatter. According to the store’s manager, the homeless loiterer refused to leave the area, even after their unarmed security officer informed the vagrant that weekend that they were officially trespassed from the property.

Conrad stepped out, took one breath, and nearly fell back into the driver’s seat. They’d warned him that a powerful smell was coming from behind the dumpster, but he brushed it off. “That’s what you get for not listening to Dispatch,” Conrad told himself, shaking his head.

This smell, however, was *powerful*. The air was sour, curdled and rotten. It reminded Conrad of when his little sister hid an egg inside an empty jewelry box one Easter, a box that held in the festering miasma until it was discovered by Conrad… in *May.* This smell, though, he could taste in the back of his throat, and whatever was behind the dumpster put his sister’s time bomb to shame.

Conrad pulled his face mask up, thought about it, and retrieved a second mask from his console. *Two filters are better than one,* he considered, taking a step towards the wall that surrounded the dumpster.

As he approached the corner, the smell began to sting Conrad’s eyes. “Portland Police Bureau,” he called out, resting one hand on the handle of his service weapon.

Rounding the corner, Conrad was relieved to see no one in sight, just a blanket covering a shopping cart. It had rained the night before- not exactly a rare occurrence in Portland- and the blanket was soaked. “Guess they couldn’t afford a tarp,” he joked to himself*.*

Despite his strong dislike for the idea, Conrad knew that he had to report what was rotting in the cart. However, that didn’t mean he had to touch the damn thing. Removing a collapsible baton from his belt and swinging the empty air before him to expand it, Conrad pushed the tip of it underneath an edge of the blanket. Gently, he pulled the blanket up and to the side, then dry heaved.

If it wasn’t for what was resting atop the trash bag, Officer Conrad could have assumed that the shopping cart had been used to transport food that had spoiled. However, the object mere inches from the end of his baton made it clear what he’d been smelling since exiting the cruiser.

A severed hand, palm up, pointed towards him with one extended, shriveled finger. The skin was a blotchy reddish-black. An eyeball had been left in the palm of the rotting hand, and after days of neglect, it had begun to decay as well. Like a deflating basketball, the eye had begun to collapse within itself, but somehow, Conrad could have sworn that it was staring up at him."

In the close-knit community, she seemed to be the only sceptic. She drove this road countless times throughout her life.

Through summers when the sun exploded through the trees in rays of love and warmth. Through autumns when the swaying pines peppered the pavement with wooden needles and bonfire red leaves. Through winters when snow lay silently on the overhead branches and ice rested perilously on the bends and corners, glistening. But never during a full moon. Never a night like tonight.

She knew the road. She trusted herself. Now her son waits for her at the lounge window. His grandmother watches on from the corner couch, smiling and knitting in the warmth, proud of the family she has raised. 

But the car lays capsized. The hazard lights flash, the horn in constant blare. A massacre of bones and blood, of glass and hair. Of iron and wine.

Recently I've been having - let's call them - _odd_ thoughts. It's like I'm in a void, and everywhere is a possibility that could happen in the future.

Usually, it's good. Like getting good grades, meeting new friends and stuff.

Then, there's the bad ones. The ones where I commit suicide, or have a mental breakdown and kill everyone I see.

It's a facinating place here, you know. Most of the time though, these thoughts don't come true. Most of the time, they remain mere fantasies.

Sometimes though, they do come true. It's never anything big, just numbers or somebody saying something.

But it got me thinking; what would happen if the bad thoughts actually happened? Would I really go all the way through, or would I manage to stop myself?

It's a confusing thing to consider, and sometimes I just put it aside to think another time. But the more I think, and the more I consider, it seems increasingly likely that I would go through with it.

So comes the final question: _how_ exactly would one of those scenarios occur? Would it be a bad day, where I'm pushed past my limits? Would it be a tragedy, where my brain is damaged beyond repair?

I hope I never find out, for all our sakes. All I know for now, is that if anything ever happens to me...

If I were my brain - which I suppose, technically, I am? - I’d want to forget about it too.

It’s one of those old tube TV’s. Strange thing is, I can’t remember ever owning a TV, let alone that massive ancient relic. Weird how the mind works, isn’t it? I can remember vividly where I put that paper clip three weeks ago, but that bulky-ass monstrosity? No dice.

I’ll peel myself from the bedsheets painfully, beckoned forth by the alluring discordancy of his crackling voice.

I pause for a second or two when I notice his blurry peepers staring directly into mine.

“Hiya there Suzie,” he says, tipping an imaginary hat nonchalantly. “Nice to have you back!”

I crawl to the couch and lie down on it awkwardly, not even slightly alarmed by the grinning stranger flickering in and out of the phantom TV - nor the fact that he seems to be addressing me directly. 

“Suzie, Suzie, Suzie,” he murmurs, shaking his head in disappointment. “What should we do with you?”

“I, uh, I don’t know,” I answer shamefully.

“You’re addicted, aren’t you?” he asks.

A weak nod. “Yes.”

“So who will it be today?”

White screaming noise fills my ears as blood and violence and death fills the screen. Faces torn to unrecognizable shreds. Bodies ripped to pieces. Internal organs rapidly turning to corpse juice in shiny oversized blenders.

“Her,” I say, pointing to the tormented face on the upper right of the flickering screen. “I choose her.”

“Ah, sweet Samantha,” the man chuckles. “Your highschool bully.”

I close one eye - the other now a forever exposed tissue lump. “I’ve made my choice,” I say.

“Of course you have, Suzie,” the man grins. “There’s just a matter of payment.”

The TV morphs and twists erratically, the unmistakable echo of saws and scalpels and rusty knives carving into flesh and sinew and bone reverberating through the room.

“Nose,” I say.

“Aaaaand?” 

“And finger.”

“Marvellous,” the man sings. “Just sit tight, and we’ll have our representative over shortly.”

The TV turns off, and I am left sobbing alone in the darkness, every little noise like blunt needles scraping exposed nerves.

A minute or two now, and they’ll be here, knives and scalpels and saws at the ready. They will ask me one more time if I’m willing to go through with it. My answer is always the same.

“Yes.”

Just a body part or two. I can live without them, for a while anyway. But not forever.

“Is it worth the pain?” they’ll ask.

“Yes,” I will murmur. “It is worth it.”

An amazing flood of the dopamine and serotonin, just feeling all of the bad thoughts go away as the good ones rush in to take their place. Haha!

""Honey! It's time for supper, dear!""

Elizabeth ran down the stairs and sat at the table. Her mum put down a bowl of hot soup for her while she took a call.

It was delicious. Elizabeth asked what her mum's famous recipe was, and she would always answer: ""It's a secret.""

But Elizabeth grew more and more curious with each passing day. 

The next morning, a knock on her door woke her up. It was her mum.

""Elizabeth, dear, I'm going to leave for the day. Now, since you've been really good this week, I'm not going to call for a babysitter. Does that sound good to you?""

She was ecstatic. Running around the room whilst her mum closed her bedroom door with a smile.

 Once she left the house, she grabbed a tub of ice cream and other various treats, and sat onto the sofa.

She was about to turn on the TV when she smelt something. A fowl smell. She looked around the house to see where it came from. Probably the neighbor's dog again.

But it was far, far worse. She went onto the basement, where she felt nauseous. She found her babysitter, but she was as pale as a ghost.

Blood pooled under the chair she was strapped in. She was terrified. Someone closed the door behind her. She turned around to face her mum. At first, she was relieved. 

She thought she would take her away from this place. Her mum grabbed her head, and hit it against the wall. Elizabeth tried oh so hard to get away, but it was futile.

She died. At least, she was right. She would take Elizabeth away. So that's what her mum did. She knelt down, and cried."

Inching its way over decayed leaves and dead branches until it dug deep into the black soil. It crawled through the loose, rich earth for some time until finding the mother load.

Rancid, rotting flesh enticed the creature to crawl to it. A mouth ringed with thousands of tiny, jagged teeth hooked into the eyes of the corps. The worm sank into the jelly of the eye, slurping up every decaying morsel. Nature requested this being to return to the earth.

As the worm ate the precious jelly, a flash of memory passed through its simple mind. It remembered hatching, crawling into the soil, consuming and defecating, returning debris to the rich soil. Before that, there was only darkness. The darkness grew deeper and warmer. Then cold, hard light.

Before he was born to crawl, he walked. He had arms and legs and stood upright. He was in a distant land. They sold children on the street here; they were his to consume. Part of his collection. He was the monster that returned them to the earth; no one cared to look for them. Consuming youth and returning it to the earth, the children were his to slaughter.

Holding a child’s cold dead hand, admiring his work, his collection. Startled by shouting in a foreign tongue, and the door swinging open. The light hurt his eyes.   Gunfire roared through the darkness—blood, and bits of flesh scattering against the earth and the soil. Coldness and ringing faded away to silence and black.

The next memory was breaking through a thin shell into the warm earth. No limbs, no sight, only smell towards the delicious rot of its former host."

Thinking about one thing or another as I walk, a chill goes down my spine, ‘Someone is watching me.’ I think. I quickly turn and see nothing, so I shake it off as my imagination. A small amount of time passes by and I get that uncomfortable feeling again, so I turn around and there’s nothing. This goes on for a few hours or so until I decide that I should turn around and go back to my car.   


I turn around and I realize, the trail is no longer there.  


I have no idea where I am or how I got here.   


That’s when the panic set in, I had nothing to defend myself with or any food besides the few protein bars and the water bottle had in my backpack. ‘Oh god I am so screwed’ I thought to myself, continuing to flip my shit. After that, I just started running in the opposite direction of the way I was walking earlier.  


It’s getting darker by the minute and there’s still no sign of the trail or any other people. That’s when I get the feeling again, I slowly look all around me and there’s no sign of anything. Then I get a thought, one that is not my own, ‘Look up.’ It says. As if being controlled by some supernatural force, I slowly turn my face skywards.

kni76t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kni76t/the_thoth/,The Thoth,114,10,1609386552.0,"Here is a small collection of monsters you should keep in mind. You know, in case of danger. 

*The Grillowader*

You'll find this creature in swampy areas. The smell alone should alert you to its position. If that is not enough, look for the tuffs of black hair protruding from the dirty water. When you find one, do not get within grabbing distance. It's arms act like roots that can burrow into the bottoms of your feet. They usually stay where it's moist but if there is fog, you need to run. They always scream. When it does, you must scream back louder. Do not approach if you have a weak voice. 

*Brindlewips*

These monstrosities build their nest within the walls of brick buildings. They are often confused with tooth fairies because of the way they stockpile any teeth they can get ahold of. Their metallic razor fingers and wings are perfect for prying molars and incisors. Brindlewips are said to prefer babies due to the softness of the gums. They attack at night and are reported to leave most victims alive. 

*Montotor*

Others refer to them as ""Top Hat Men"" but I feel this name lacks a certain element. Montotor's are the reason children are afraid of the dark. They drink fear from their victims before the real feast starts. These beings move with a startling crawling motion that is only worsened by the sound of its bones rubbing against its dry paper skin. If you think something is watching you, it is almost always a Montotor. Light is its only weakness.

*Apa Apa*

I was a little hesitant to add this one to my list but a warning couldn't hurt. Apa Apa are a breed of human like creatures that blend into normal society. They often take the positions of a higher ups at powerful companies. Make no mistake, these are just as dangerous as any of the others. That man who just jumped off the top story of the nearby office? These are the things's that put those ideas into the heads of normal men and women. 

*The Thoth*

Back in Egypt, they were worshipped as the inventor of writing. In a way that is true, but writing was just another way to infect the minds of the readers. The Thoth will often present a story of warnings to plant itself into the mind. Once the information is absorbed, The Thoth will appear. Many victims report extreme paranoia before inevitable death. When hieroglyphics went out of style, The Thoth were left with no way to travel. That is until our current age. With modern translation technology, The Thoth can travel easier than ever."

For a minute I was disoriented without an inkling of where I was, then it all came rushing back to me.

I was in the Amazon jungle in Peru on a shamanic Ayahuasca journey, trying to see if this magical brew could assuage the suppressed childhood abandonment trauma and abuse I suffered in the many orphanages I grew up in.

I had spent three days and nights without food or water, just the medicine, and my thoughts. Hours earlier I had ingested an Amazonian psychedelic to give me an insight into my soul. Was it working?

I wondered what caused the pain in my palms and in my fingers, As my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the moonlight, I raised my palms and noticed it was layered with tiny bumps like pinpricks. Could I be reacting to the brew or was I bitten by some jungle insect? I applied a bug salve and went back to sleep.

On my flight back to the States, my palms kept itching despite the copious application of salves and antibug sprays. On landing in America after the 8-hour redeye flight, I noticed that one of the bumps on my palm had burst open and to my shock, whatever was in it had eaten cleanly right through the flesh of my palm to the other side!

Raising my palm to the sunlight, I could see a pinhole of light shining through.

What the hell was happening to me?

Was I still hallucinating on the forest floor in Peru or was this actually happening?

I rushed home in an airport taxi, dropped my luggage, and headed straight to the shower.

As the water from the shower hit my body I knew I had just made a huge mistake.

Whatever was in those bumps suddenly came alive. The itch returned with a murderous fury. As I scrubbed my palms, tiny specks of flesh fell off onto the slippery floor of my bathroom.

My palms were slowly being filled with tiny holes, turning them into sieves.

As I touched other parts of my body, bumps immediately appeared and burst out leaving clear-through holes in their wake.

My throat started to itch too, I instinctively made to scratch the skin on it, and immediately a fine spray of blood burst out and sprayed all over the glass walls.

Screams gurgled weakly out of my pinhole riddled throat as I hit the bathroom floor and watched thick red blood coalesce with specks of my skin go down the drain just as life slowly left my body."

She was from a good family whose minor successes in business and local politics were unimaginable to mine. After graduating from high school, nobody saw, and her parents stopped inviting people over. Excuses were made, and people talked.

“Her mother died first, and the wake was her first public appearance in years. The wake was held at home, and in the corner of the parlor she sat. Her father or one the braver members of her extended family must have tried to comb the knots out of her hair, because the comb was still tangled in her grease-slick hair. She was dressed in mourner’s black, but she smiled and wore the comb like a trophy, gloating like a spider over a silk-wrapped fly. My grandmother was one of the few who came close enough to smell her. At her father’s wake, she was curled up in the same corner with the same arachnid poise. She wasn’t at church for either parent’s funeral mass.

“The cats accumulated slowly. The curtains were always drawn, but the cats sat on the windowsills and cast shadows. After a few years, there was a cat in every window. By the time that I was a kid, they were constantly fighting for window space. Animal control gets called every once in a while, but they always say that she’s caring for her pets humanely.”

“I used to see her all the time when she was running errands. I’d always say hi and wave. I wonder if she knows that I’m related to my grandmother, because she always smiles back. Her teeth are like buttercup petals. She must smoke at least a pack a day. She wears these ridiculous fur coats from the Great Depression, and the patches that still have fur are tinted yellow from cigarette smoke. She must just sit in that house and exhale all over herself.”

“We don’t even know if she’s dead, and you’ve already composed the first part of her ghost story. That’s messed up.”

“Some say that on windy nights like this, you can still hear the comb rock back and forth in her hair.” We both laugh. We’re in the cruiser on the way to check up on her. A neighbor who hasn’t seen her for a few days thinks that she’s dead. We pull up and knock. She doesn’t answer the door, but it’s unlocked. The whole house smells like a hospital bed soaked in fever sweat. There’s dust and hair everywhere. We split up. I want to get a good look at the parlor.

“These aren’t cats,” my partner calls from another room. I turn the parlor lights on, and I see her in the corner. She’s hunched forward with her hair in front of her face, and she’s running her toenails through it like a scratching dog. The torn hair piles up. The hair gets up and walks to me, unsteady as a newborn lamb."

I had never seen one before, and I was very excited to see all the performers and animals that would be there.

I decided that I wanted popcorn and a drink, so my dad handed me a 5$ bill. I excitedly ran towards the stands. After getting my popcorn and soda, I heard a whisper.

“Psttt!”

I turned my head to find the source of the noise.

“Psttt!”

A gloved hand appeared from behind a curtain. It curled its finger trying to draw me closer. I thought it was a mechanical hand that was part of an attraction or something, so I went towards it.

As I did, I felt a gloved hand cover my mouth. I was pulled into a backstage area where it was only me and the person pulling me.

When I finally got sat down, I was tied to a chair. The clown who had dragged stood in front of me admiring his work. I could still see his beard, and he only had on his clown pants. He had a crazed look in his eyes.

“You wanna see a real circus, kid?” he asked.

I shook my head, but the clown didn’t seem to care. He grabbed a cup full of a strange liquid and squeezed my cheeks to force my mouth open. He poured it down my throat, and suddenly I felt dizzy.

My sense of time seemed to slow down, and everything around me started to distort.

The next thing I remember, I was in a dark place on a conveyor belt. All around me were neon colored clowns that seemed to tower over me. I looked to the end of the belt and saw that there was a giant colorful hammer. Each time it slammed down, the whole world seemed to shake.

I tried to escape, but no matter how much I kicked or squirmed I couldn’t undo the ropes. One of the clowns pulled a lever, and the conveyor belt started carrying me towards the hammer. 

I screamed which caused all the clowns to look down on me and laugh. Their laughs sounded like telephone noises and loud rings, and it overwhelmed all my senses. Tears streamed down their neon colored faces as they pointed at me and mocked me.

My feet began to get dangerously close to the hammer. Each quake got stronger. I felt myself grow cold as I approached like my body was trying to shut itself down as much as possible before I was crushed.

The hammer slammed down at the base of my shoes. I was pulled under and saw the huge face of the hammer looming over me. Just as it was about to slam down, I snapped out of it. I awoke to find the clown from before being held back by other performers. A knife was at his feet.

That was the last circus I ever went to."

Morning news anchors would repeat the same words. “Richard Bryant is still missing. The search continues. Here’s Carl with the morning commute”. It was just lip service now. How long could they really look for his body before they called the search off?  Law enforcement had covered the same ground three weeks ago when it was first discovered that Richard was gone. It seemed like he had disappeared forever. 

Richard caressed her face. His fingers gliding over her cheek, tucking loose hair behind her ear. His hands didn’t feel the same. The warmth was gone. How she yearned for the past. When they had been closer, excited newlyweds just starting their lives together. Every day felt like an adventure then. Not anymore. 

“Breaking news. Sources say that law enforcement have found remains this morning. It is still unknown at this time if the body belongs to Richard Bryant. We will update you as soon as we receive more information.”

Richard stroked her arms, cupping her elbows with the palm of his hand. His touch used to bring her chills, hairs standing on end. She filled with electricity when he embraced her. How the whole world would stop when he held her. This wasn’t the same. It’s been too long, she thought. It would never be like it was. 

“The remains have been identified. Richard Bryant, the man who law enforcement say has been missing for over three weeks, has been found. We will have more information as the story unfolds.”

Richard’s hands were large and strong. A working man’s hands, She ran her fingers over the calluses on his palms. A carpenter by trade, he worked hard to give them whatever they needed. She remembered when they first saw this house, and they fell in love with it immediately. Quietly tucked away in the woods, where she would sip coffee and watch from the window as Richard walked to the shed every morning to gather his tools for work. 

The telephone rings. Richard has been found, they said. They would like to bring her in for another line of questioning. Foul play was suspected, as the corpse had been dismembered. They will be right over.

She remembered how easily Richard’s saw went through bone. How she delicately removed the bones from the skin. How his hands fit hers like a glove. How there was still warmth in his hands as she slid them on. How the memories came back as she caressed her face with his hands. The warmth was long gone now. His hands, their love, this world had grown cold. It was all over."
kn8knw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kn8knw/morningstar_community_church/,Morningstar Community Church,16,1,1609355544.0,"Welcome to Morningstar Community Church! We are pleased to announce that you have been chosen to be one of our interns this summer! Follow each rule on this list or you will be terminated accordingly. 

1. As ministers of the Lord, sin does not apply to us. However, if you see a member of the congregation fall short of His glory, remove whatever body part of theirs that caused them to sin. 

2. We are very active in the community, and we ask that you take part in the events as well. One such activity, is a drug abuse outreach. The more minds we can numb, the more minds we can control. 

3. You are only to interact with other interns during our once a week staff meeting. Stay away from them at all other times. They have their own sets of rules, and you just might be a part of them.

4. Your family will tell you that what you are doing is “evil” and “immoral” but you know the truth. They are wrong. We are your family now. You will be expected to deal with any unbelievers. 

5. Sometimes you will enter the sanctuary and see featureless beings seated in the rows. If they are facing away from you, then they have forgiven you, but they will not forget. Death by your hand is a better option if you enter the sanctuary and they are turned towards you. There’s a storage room next to the sanctuary. Hopefully there’s something in there for you to use.

6. Be in the green room 15 minutes before each service time so that we can dedicate the message with prayer. We don’t pray to God. Praying to God is just for the congregation. 

7. Don’t let anyone play the worship music backwards. The congregation hasn’t been the same since that last happened. 

8. The pastor brings in the communion elements every third Sunday at 6am before the first service. You must be there to help the pastor prepare. The anesthesia will wear off soon, and we can’t let neighbors hear their screaming as you’re cutting into them. We know they taste good, but don’t take more than necessary for communion.

9. The Lord tells our pastor who will be next month’s gift for communion. Do not protest him if it ends up being somebody you know. 

10. When entering the pastor’s office, knock six times in quick succession. That will let him know you are staff and not one of them from above. 

11. Always lock the doors behind you when you leave for the night. Things here have a habit of making their way into peoples’ homes. We will know if you left the door unlocked because whatever followed you home will be wearing your skin the next morning. 

12. If you do well, the internship will turn into a permanent position. A vow to the Lord is a lifelong commitment. Don’t you dare ever look for other employment."

Unfortunately, most people forget that time is an abstract concept, and has no direct bearing on events. 


Three weeks ago, a giant crack ran down the moon. We sent scientists up to research it, but they couldn’t find any particular reason for it, so they sent me out to investigate theories on Earth. 


I go to travel on the company dime, so I spared no expense. I went to several different countries, met with several isolated tribes, and reviewed prophecies and other weird predictions. 


I’m aware this was a last resort style of research, but if you have a better idea, I’d love to hear it. 


Only one group had any documentation of the Moon “hatching” in the future. This tribe was a subsection of Christinity, that split off sometime around 165 BC, and claimed to have intimate knowledge of the events to follow.  


The tribe called themselves the Sealers. They explained to me that the Old and New Testament sound different for a reason, that the thing we called God in both parts of the bible was actually two different beings.


The thing called God in the old testament is an old thing, ruling by fear and brimstone, looking for lifeforms across the galaxy to worship him. He got to Earth and subdued humans to his will, for a long time. 


Eventually, through unknown means, the Sealers lived up to their name, and sealed the Old God in a “large prison made of Earth,” which was launched into the sky, cursing the old God to orbit the planet he cannot control forever. 


The Sealers brought forth a new God, a more merciful being that genuinely loved humanity. This is why the God in the New Testament seems so much kinder than the God in the Old Testament, because they’re two completely different beings. The Old God ruled with fire and obedience, the New God offered with forgiveness and mercy.


The Sealers also claimed that this isn’t a permanent solution, they’d been communicating with the New God to prepare for the inevitable battle between the two, which will determine the future of humanity. If the Old God wins, we return to a world of punishment and fear. If the New God wins, life continues as normal, as we’ve come to expect, not fair, but much more merciful. 


Even the Sealers do not know how much time we have. Researchers on the moon had noticed massive spikes in radiation, to the point where a few had become sick. 


We lost contact with them three days ago. 


I’m sitting around a campfire, waiting with the Sealers. We watch the moon open up, a giant hand of darkness and fire emerging from inside it. 


The Old God is back for us, and all humanity can do is pray. "

‘Never!’ I repeated, and it was true.

Never, never, never.

Horace is coming to house-sit today.

He’s a local ‘friend’ of Joy, but he’s no friend of mine.

I don’t trust him.

He reminds me of greasy suede.

He mutters obscenities when Joy’s not listening, and stares at her treasured gold ornaments. Family heirlooms.

He covets them.

I watch him.

Joy is, very surprisingly, quite a wealthy woman. Not many people know it.

But Horace knows it.

He arrives at midday. 

‘Say hello to Horace!’ Joy smiles.

We regard each other.

‘Horace.’

‘Daisy.’ He tips his hat to me, and Joy laughs.

‘Be good, Daisy,’ she grins. ‘Let me know if he says anything, won’t you!”

‘Be good,’ I reply back.

With a cheerful wave, and a clink of keys in the hallway, she’s off.

Four uneventful hours have passed - each ignoring the other - but we both know Joy is due back soon.

The warm Texas sun is setting. Peculiar shadows skitter outside.

Horace looks at me. 

‘I’m Joy’s only real friend, Daisy,’ he whispers nastily.  His eyes, much like his teeth, are yellow and ancient. ‘I’m the only one in her will. Jealous?’

‘Jealous?’ I enquire.

‘That’s right, you are.’

He kneels in front of me. ‘But, you know, she’s an old woman now. An old, senile woman, who has a lot - shall we say - a lot to offer.’

He sweeps his gaze gleefully around the room.

‘An I’m not a patient man, Daisy.’ His voice hardens. ‘I get sick of waiting.’

My heart starts thrumming, but I bite my tongue.

‘Times are tight, so to speak,’ he continues, ‘and that inheritance money - well, that’s about 20 thousand right there, what with them gold statues.

He looks at me.

'Joy never locks her doors at night.’

I know what he’s about to say.

*Say it,* I urged silently. *Say it out loud.*

He grins.

‘I’m going to murder Joy!’ He whispers. ‘I’m going to murder Joy, and who knows what the fuck will happen to you then! You’re sure as hell not living with me!’

*Murder. Joy. Murder. Joy.*

He stands up then, and ambles towards the door.

‘Oh. And one more thing.’

He turns back.

My blood freezes.

‘Sleep well tonight, Daisy,

Two hours later, the clock ticks on in the brassy silence, and I lie in wait.

I’ve been practicing.

‘Murder Joy!' I repeat to the empty sitting room. ‘Murder Joy! Murder Joy!'

Then, a light floods the porch outside. I hear her key in the lock.

I ruffle my feathers in a nervous flush, and strain on my perch.

I always talk to Joy when people have visited.

""I've finally found you,"" she whispered to him in between his short gasps for air. They were huddled together face to face in a small alleyway, surrounded by putrid decaying brick, horse manure and the monotonous sound of raindrops connecting with mud. 

She had searched the streets for this man over the course of several months, to no avail. After she had read the grisly details of his crimes in the paper, his disturbing post-coitus rambling had suddenly made sense. His knees crumbled as they both dropped to the sludge.

""Do you remember me? You bastard spawn of Satan,"" she whispered into his dying ear, lying on top of his shaking wet body. ""You once told me all about how much you liked to *gut,* things."" The knife still lodged in his stomach twisted, and he sucked in as much air as he could. The rain was washing out his insides which had begun to spill out. Somehow, that final breath would not leave him. 

He just stared at her, trying to recall her face... Then, she could see in his eyes that the memory of their nights together had returned to him. ""Whore,"" he coughed with blood and eyes wide as the night. 

""Oh yes, and I want you to look deep into these eyes, the eyes that you have seen go dark far too many times, and know that you will never hurt us again. Look deep, and show me fear."" The woman yanked the knife out of the man's stomach and with the brute force of a hammer, plunged it blindly into his face. Again. And again...

The piercing sound of a police whistle cut through the air like an icicle crashing into steel. ""Oy! What do ya think you're doin' there?!"" Two policemen came running toward the brutal scene of the woman still hammering. ""My, *God* in heaven... Don't you move!"" The taller, paler policeman pulled her off the man and wrestled the knife away. She was screaming and kicking with the black rain and soft moonlight echoing from her bloody nightgown.

""Let go of me you dense animals! That's Jack the fuckin' Ripper!"""

A grim reaper holding a scythe, one bony hand raised to warn off would-be divers. Behind the sign was a slim steel gate covering a hole the size of a kiddie pool. It was the only entrance to Violet Drop, a mass of underwater tunnels and caves resting like a tumor off Maryland’s eastern shore.

Calvin floated over to the gate. There was a lot of silt in the water; it danced slowly across the beam of his flashlight as he fixed it on the heavy padlock. His hand shook, but only a little, as he pressed the key into the hole and turned it. A recreational diver, Calvin’s OWD certification wasn’t enough to convince the dive shop to grant him access to Violet Drop. So he’d swiped the key while the cashier was distracted filling up tanks.

Calvin was dying and touching the bottom of Violet was the last item on his bucket list. He’d be damned if a lack of experience would prevent him from feeling that deep, cold water. With a quick kick of his fins, Calvin slipped into the cave entrance.

Any light from the surface was dead and buried within 20-feet down the tunnel. Calvin swam slowly, one hand sweeping his light back-and-forth, the other brushing against the porous rock of the cave wall. Violet Drop was 85-percent charted. Calvin wanted to go through that other 15-percent that was too deep and narrow to explore. Too risky for anyone but a dying man.

The passages became tighter as they curved down, a series of stone knots that Calvin navigated as best he could from the memory of a map. At several points, he had to peel off his oxygen tank and push it forward before squeezing through slim openings in the cave. Once he made it to the uncharted portion of Violet Drop, Calvin felt his mouth ache from the grin.

He wasn’t swimming anymore, the passages were too narrow. Calvin crawled and squirmed, fighting for every inch. Finally, he saw an opening. He was nearly at the bottom. Lunging forward, Calvin tried to extend his arm only to find his shoulders wedged. Panicking, Calvin tried to back up but couldn’t budge.

He was stuck.

Nearly an hour passed before Calvin saw the first crab. It was pale and appeared as soft as a marshmallow. The crustacean was nearly as big as a cat. Two uncomfortably human eyes extended from its shell on twitching stalks. Instead of claws, the creature had tiny hands with delicate fingers. It regarded Calvin curiously. Then the crab split nearly in half along a seam in its shell.

Calvin stared down into row after row of small, perfect, human teeth. The creature *hissed*. More hissing came from deeper in the tunnel. Then the *click click click* of hundreds of boney legs headed toward the trapped diver."

Ready?

*Four hundred metres.*

[Bump. Muffled: ""dead zone… no surveillance…""]

*Please state your name.*

[Truck slows]

Dr. Irving Haskell.

*You have approximately ten minutes, Dr. Haskell.*

About my compensation—

*As discussed. Ten million dollars and safe passage to Beijing in exchange for your knowledge.*

Where do I start?

*The beginning.*

It started in Peru in 2003.

*You were involved from the beginning?*

Yes, I'd been involved in the initial planning since the 1990s, and I took over as overseer in 2001.

*Why Peru?*

Lack of government interference. Away from Chinese spies.

*Why didn't it start earlier?*

The tech wasn't there. We lacked the ability.

*Ability to do what?*

Brain transplants.

*Tell me about the site in Peru.*

It was an orphanage joined to a hospital for the mentally deficient.

*Children?*

Partly.

*What did you hope to accomplish?*

We were afraid we were falling behind in science—in intelligence, and we hoped to close the gap by accelerating the education of a select few... superspecimen.

*Explain the process.*

It was based on the Russian doping programs and Chinese sports camps, but instead of isolating gifted children and specializing them in gymnastics, we wanted to specialize them in mathematics, physics, chemistry.

*You mentioned brain transplants.*

Yes, that was the breakthrough. Because even the most gifted mind takes time to learn. We invented a bypass. By extracting one child's brain and implanting it successively in what we called learners—

*Did the children die?*

The donors, yes. Unfortunately.

*What were the learners?*

People. Mental deficients whose heads we'd hollowed out and whose bodies we'd re-engineered into biological learning machines. One for each subject, and the donor brains completed the cycle, transplanted into each learner in turn.

[Sigh]

I'll never forget the learning chamber, those docile bodies sitting and learning the same thing over and over. Barely resting, barely eating...

*Then?*

The brains were rehomed.

*Into superspecimen?*

Yes, children the same age as those from whom we'd harvested the brains. You can appreciate the elegance. Learning untangled from time. Education in the blink of an eye.

*Did it work?*

Oh, yes.

*How did you choose between donors and superspecimen?*

At random.

*But one died and the other survived.*

That's a matter of perspective. The donor's body died, but its brain actually thrived in the superspeciman's body.

*Did you know their names?*

Always.

[Truck engine cuts]

What's the—

*Mateo Garcia. Angel Rodriguez. Hugo Echeveria. Alvaro Fonseca. Pablo Jimenez.*

[Breathing]

*Javier Lopez. Manuel Perez. Rodrigo Morales. I can go on.*

Those were all learners.

[Breathing]

Who… are you?

*I am all of them. Or they are me.*

Impossible.

*I didn't just learn the foundations of science, Dr. Haskell. I learned my-selves. I became twenty-seven of them. Imagine what it feels like to be twenty-seven people's desire for revenge.*

You're mad. The learners were eliminated when the program was shut down—

*It was never shut down.*

In 2017.

*You were removed as overseer.*

I...

*Until next time, Doctor.*

Santa has come and gone. He's eaten all the cookies and drank all the milk. He's almost completely dead from a sugar overload. We've fought in the trenches of the electronic aisle, we've spilled blood in the children's section, and we've racked up credit card bills so high, the numbers get fuzzy after a while, and you cannot quite understand them for some reason. 

We've reached the end of 2020 and unfortunately, the world doesn't reset. The start of 2021 is going to continue to be miserable, but we've got renewed hope that shit will un-hit the fan soon.

He figures he must have been drinking last night because his head was pounding so hard, he could almost hear it. He gets out of the bottom bunk of a bunkbed, dragging his feet toward the bathroom to his left. He trips over something and while turning to see what is was, he sees his wife in the corner to the right.

are you crying? mark asks his wife. she does not answer.  He walks toward her, asking if she was alright. she does answer and mark becomes suddenly enraged at her silence and yells,

 why arent you answering me? 

his wife turns, the sight of her makes him wince for some reason, his wife says

you know why im not answering you!

no i dont, mark replies.

im mad at what you did, the wife says, and i dont want to talk to you.

what did I do? the pounding grows louder, omg what did i drink last night?

he starts to back up but his wife grabs him by the face, then says,

its not the drink baby, dont back up.

why not? and what is it? mark questions.

His wife answers, because you cant take it.

cant take what?

she kisses him, then says goodbye, and walks to the door.

mark yells, where you going , you leaving me?

she touches the door knob and the door flies open as police rush in, holding mark at gun point, he no longer sees his wife.

Mark screams, what are you doing in here, and what did yall do with my wife, babe?

mark calls but gets no answer, the cops look at him in a very peculiar way and mark begins to feel uneasy. He backs up, studdering, 

wh-wh-why yall in here man? he takes one final step backwards and falls over.

He screams, realizing what he tripped over was the body of his wife. The police, at a lost for words puts handscuffs around marks wrists as he still screams

Their daughter had been missing for some time. From what I gather there had been an accident and they hadn’t been able to reach her since. I hated seeing them like this so I knew I had to be the one to track her down. After they left I told Margaret my assistant about the case. She seemed encouraging then she went to get me a fruit cup, she likes to take care of me.


Oct 19- Not many leads on the case, the missing girl didn’t seem to have any enemies or any reason to leave. I’ve looked through her social media and everyone is just wishing her well. One girl stood out to me; Amanda. I’ve asked her to come see me.


Oct 21- Amanda has paid me a visit, she seemed awkward but probably anxious to see her friend again. No new information to report, Amanda is not a suspect. Everything seems to lead to a dead end.


Oct 24- The girl could not have gone missing on her own. Her car was destroyed during the accident. She had no known friends or family out of the area. Her accounts haven’t been touched. Her sister spent the day telling me all about the girl’s history.


Oct 28- The Robinsons come every couple of days looking for an update, I didn’t want to disappoint them but they seem happy to hear what I had to say. They only had good things to say about Amanda.


Oct 29- I fear the case may be in jeopardy. I may have gotten too close to the truth. Every time I want to go to investigate something Margaret will give me an excuse why I can’t. She is either protecting me or trying to stop me finding out what happened to the girl. Maybe she’s involved? She is always writing something in that notebook of hers.


Oct 30- This case is causing me a lot of stress, Margaret has been giving me medication for headaches. What if she’s drugging me? I need to get to the bottom of this.


Nov 5- It’s been few days. Margaret has kept her distance she can tell I’m suspicious, she’ll only come in to give me my meals.


Nov 10- I have found a clue to crack this case wide open. While Margaret was distracted I had a chance to sneak her notebook. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. She knows a lot more than she’s letting on. In her notes she has written about the missing girl a lot. She must know where she is and I’m going to make her show me. This poor girl. Margaret has written that she has become ‘paranoid’ and ‘delusional’ and that she has recommends a higher dose of medication."

It seems like forever, like this place *spawned* me, and yet... didn’t I had a life before too? Yes... I... was... I can’t remember.
 
Does it even matter anymore? I’m here now, in this... place.
 
What is this place? It’s dark, and cold... how did I get here? I was... exploring... yeah, that’s the word. I (Was? Am?) a curious person... I think. I think I had... a fundamental interest in the world... and a *need* for... what was it... adventure.
 
I don’t think I had very many friends, but those I did, I think they shared my curiosity... Yes, we would go on *adventures* together, not that they were really adventures, we hardly ever found anything interesting in the places we explored. Not until that last time anyway... when was that? That was the time we found *it*
 
What was it? It’s been so hard to remember things lately... like I’m changing somehow... What am I becoming? What was I before?
 
I think it was tall, it was certainly unnatural, emaciated. Its features, I think they were... twisted somehow, asymmetrical, not enough to immediately understand what was wrong, just enough to register that *something* was.
 
The story is coming back to me as I think about it, it’s foggy but I think I remember enough to tell it now.
 
It made a noise unlike anything I’ve ever heard, almost like... singing, but with no recognizable melody. The sound was slow, unnatural, almost like multiple voices of wildly varying ages all “singing” at the same time. It didn’t charge us, or attack us at all. In fact, it was... sitting, with its legs pulled up to its chest and its elbows and forearms resting on the ground, and its palms facing up, just... staring longingly at the night sky. We tried to stand still and not make any noise, but somehow it knew we were there. And it turned and *looked* at us... and... then I was here. In the darkness, with no idea how I got here, or... who I am?
 
My memories are fading again, I can feel myself slipping away...
 
How long have I been here?"

I didn't think much about it much, just thought the pigs were all having a brawl with each other.

&#x200B;

The next day, me and my uncle headed down to the house to fetch some equipment we needed to visit my late dying grandmother.

When we got there and pried open both doors, the smell hit the both of us first as we made our way through the pins. There lying on the hay and mud filled ground was our eleven boars, gutted, mutilated, and dismembered. Their intestines were all wrapped around the poles that hold the upper top area, like some gruesome decorations. 

And when we got through the piles of the bodies, a single note covered in crimson, red liquid, was on the floor, I picked it up and it said,

&#x200B;

""Thanks for the late night buffet, I may come back again someday, I'm coming for you next Daniel""

That was the name of my uncle, who was reading over my shoulder and soon moved out a week later."

It's a very relaxing place to be, I don't usually have to worry about interacting with anyone but my dog. Now my dog ,Rufus, was laying on the floor, asleep. When all the sudden we heard,

*knock knock knock*

""Who could be knocking at the door at this time of night?"" ,I said to Rufus as I got up out of my old rocking chair. I opened the door and, to my surprise, no one was there. I looked to the right and to the left, but there was no one in sight. I closed the door, and not even 10 seconds later,

*knock knock knock*

I open the door again, this time with more haste, but once again, no one in sight. I closed the door angrily and was walking to my rocking chair when I heard,

*knock knock knock*

At this point I had just about enough of this, so I grabbed my 12 gauge double barrel shotgun, and loaded it with ammo. I opened the door and ,of course, no one was there. I shut the door again, and just as I turned around, I saw it, it was 7 feet tall, it had big claws, and its eyes were as dark as night. It took me a moment to realize, but it was eating my dog, Rufus. I had to think quick, I cocked my 12 gauge shotgun and fired two rounds into that Godforsaken beast.

*thump*

It fell over on its side, and died. Whatever that thing was, it killed my dog. And now everytime I hear a knock at my door, I can't help but think twice about opening it."

kmurdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmurdj/frost_bites/,Frost Bites,67,11,1609301755.0,"Fruit flies are so fond of ketchup that they lay their eggs in it. But the United States Food and Drug Administration enforces strict limits. Quality assurance researchers must guarantee that, per 100 grams of condiment, there are no more than 15 fruit fly eggs and no more than one fruit fly maggot.

If you thought that was gross, wait for what comes next. 

In 2020, General Mills (or “Big G” as it’s called in the Great Lakes Region) avoided catastrophe. The *”multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods”* calls Minneapolis home, the same city where my dingy newspaper is based. My intrepid investigative reporters almost exposed the truth.

Big G makes lots of things, including various cereals we’ve all heard of: *Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Count Chocula*, and much more. They also briefly made a cereal called *Frost Bites,* advertised as “icicle-shaped, corn-based, blueberry frosted clusters.” But *Frost Bites* were pulled from stores the night before their nation-wide unveiling, helping Big G avert a crisis that would have made all previous genetically modified food controversies look rosy by comparison.

John Ford Bell, great-grandson of Big G’s founder, dreamed up *Frost Bites* as a winter 2020 surprise. The new brand was positioned as a marketing blitz to kick-start the company’s transition into 2021. But a special ingredient was discovered after a million boxes of the stuff were already manufactured. In early 2020, John Ford Bell’s wife and five children were “stranded in a snowstorm” and “died of natural causes” at their vacation home in southern Ontario. Big G covered up the fact that Bell, a manic depressive, murdered them. 

The secret ingredient in Frost Bites, according to since-silenced whistleblowers, was Bell’s family’s cremains. Bell was unavailable for comment thanks to blowing off his head in his corner office at Big G headquarters in early December. Sweeping everything under the rug was as easy as the conglomerate tapping into a fraction of their $15 billion annual revenue to shut us up. 

Whether you believe this or write me off as a conspiracy theorist is your choice. But consider this the next time you take a bite of cereal: past the smiling bumblebees, bubbly leprechauns, and ripoff universal monsters are dark, well-disguised truths. 

Was that bite you just ate particularly *mealy*? Did that burnt cereal kernel taste funny, perhaps a bit like chemicals? Are the wheaten dregs amidst the leftover milk you just slurped down giving you a good old-fashioned case of funny tummy?

It’s a real “bay leaf in the spaghetti sauce”-type situation. A “Charlie and the Golden Ticket”-sort of deal. The chances are one in a million that you’re eating an actual fruit fly maggot or the remains of a murdered child. 

But don’t say I didn’t warn you about the possibility. As the adage goes, “you are what you eat.”"
kmtk55,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmtk55/envy/,Envy,33,2,1609297425.0,"Envy - such a fickle emotion, don't you agree? Born out of want, and fuelled by hatred. Many have succumbed to it, going from calm, rational people to primal savages. They scheme and plot, hoping for a taste of the better life that lies just out of reach.

Not everyone fails, though. Sure, the majority of the population lack the means to achieve their goals. But every now and then, there comes one who has not only the motivation, but also the intelligence to pull off such a feat.

I envy you, you know. And bad things happen to people I envy.

I remember the first time that it happened. I was young and sloppy back then, and my methods were far from foolproof. But in that moment, standing above the dismembered corpse of my enemy, I finally understood it all; the world was unfair, and not everyone got what they wanted.

So I began my journey. Searching for the rich and the powerful, taking what I wanted and killing those who got in my way. I can remember every kill; the terrified screams, the splatter of blood, the way their eyes stared lifeless as I crushed their heart in my hands.

You might wonder why I envy you. You are neither rich, powerful or famous. But I have enough of that, and you have what I desire. You see, in my travels I realised; what use was money, without others to share it with? What use was fame, without others to bear witness to my glory?

So I watched, and I waited. Patiently biding my time, keeping watch for the one whom I would deem fit to take with me. It was dreary task, but in the end, it was all worth it. Because amidst the crowds of dim-witted fools, I found you.

You're not perfect, of course, but then again nobody is. Your pesky morals and avoidance of blood is - sub-optimal, at best. You're an adaptive person though, and I'm sure that a few kills of your own should fix most of those irritating problems.

So you see? There's nothing to worry about. All you have to do, is come with me! 

Sit tight; I'll be there soon."
kmt0x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmt0x0/balancing_act/,Balancing Act,66,5,1609295536.0,"Avoid the circus, they kept telling me. The circus is off limits to visitors.

*“Off limits”, seriously?* Whenever I pressed them for explanations, they’d say, their eyes wandering, that they were really fond of their old circus and would hate to see it closed down due to “structural unsafety”, “unethical animal practices” or whatever other *un*\-problem government pricks liked to close places down for nowadays.

Their instincts were right; I was no ordinary visitor. For two months prior, their town hall had been placing an oddball assortment of orders for materials, equipment, and heavily NDA’d software jobs. Some were with former army contractors, which got my higher-ups all excited. Privately, I had them pegged as bumbling public-construction enthusiasts. *A baby-sized tower of Babel.* Or else it was a convoluted embezzlement scheme. Something for other government pricks to worry about. Not us.

The circus itself stood in the middle of a strangely deserted square. Every now and then I’d hear a muffled fanfare, though; and people looking like legitimate circus performers were going in and out.

I had no trouble planting a night-vision camera nearby. *Gotcha.* The clowns and acrobats kept filtering in and out at night. And now they were joined by people wearing gas masks.

We were a step ahead of them. The gas-mask order was what had alerted us in the first place. I’d brought my own.

At the entrance, I named one of the software firms they’d contracted. They sprayed me all over with something before letting me in. Backstage, gas-masked people with laptops were doing something to animatronic lions and horses. *Incredibly lifelike.* I wandered off and saw that the show was still on at that hour.

Two clowns were growling unintelligibly at each other, occasionally breaking into hollow, mechanical guffaws. The laughter and claps from the audience sounded uninspired. Finally the clowns ambled away with an unnatural, stilted gait.

A fanfare sounded, the lighting changed, and a tightrope walker appeared overhead. I thought at first that she was a robot too. The same stilted movements. It would take some insane skill to zombie-walk a tightrope.

I went up to the lighting booth. I named my real, three-letter employer and demanded to know what was going on. I removed my gas mask and nearly puked from the smell coming off my own clothes.

The gray-haired lighting guy briefly ran a spotlight across the seats.

The decomposing faces have been haunting me ever since. Especially the kids. *An* un-*problem indeed. As in “undead”.*

“Ma’am, you don’t want to act alive, or smell alive, in front of that audience. Or you’ll end up among them. You see, everyone in town loves our circus—even after death, apparently.

Yes, that is terrible. Thank you for your condolences. Ever since, I made a sacred vow to rid the world of every single one of you thankless, violent leeches I come across.

That's what you all say, but you're all the same.

We were nearby, about 20 minutes away but me and my younger sister were hungry, so we stopped at a McDonald's on the way. We would have gone through the drive thru but it was closed so we had to go inside to order.

The McDonald's was emptier than I'd ever seen one. It was about an hour to midnight so my mum ordered it to go. While she was ordering I noticed an old man. He must have been 50 or 60, he was gray with an unkempt beard. But at that age, the thing that struck me the most odd was that he was alone on new years eve, and I remember thinking how sad it was and how much I would have hated having that happen to me.

At the time I didn't notice but he looked like an older version of my young self. 

But I never thought much about it until now. It only now dawned on me that I'm sitting in an empty McDonald's alone on new years eve in my late 50's, with gray hair and an unkempt beard. 

Then I saw a young boy walk in with his mother and his sister... I saw him looking at me and I thought that he looked like I did when I was younger... I wonder if he will end up like me..."

A bell on the door jingles as I enter Madame Gloria’s Cauldron, the hole-in-the-wall trinket store I’d been searching for. In keeping with the shop’s mystical theme is its shopkeeper, a beautiful woman draped in a colourful shawl and dark lipstick who bustles out to assist me.

“Holiday’s blessings” smiles the raven-haired lady. “What brings you to my store today, dear?”

“Well, word on the street is you sell jinxed knickknacks here” I answer mischievously, glancing around at the strange artefacts and ingredients. “You know—crystal balls that give scary visions, bath salts that dissolve skin, mints that fuse your mouth together—the *real deal*.”

Madame Gloria’s eyes furrow in a cross between scorn and bewilderment.

“You’ve been told...correctly,” she replies with an air of caution. “But I must impress upon you that hexes are very serious—what has the recipient done to warrant such punishment?”

At this I give a small laugh, waving the scrap of paper with his name on it.

“Nothing! Arthur’s just the biggest wuss in my friend group. Dude is scared of *everything*. When besides KK am I gonna get the opportunity to prank him anonymously and be the centre of attention? Now, can you help me or not?”

For the next hour, Madame Gloria begrudgingly sorts through the menagerie of items until, eventually, I settle on one perfect for scaring Arthur.

“Thank you for your patronage” she breezes, placing the gift-wrapped box in my hands. “May you get *just* the reaction you seek.”

I can barely contain my anticipation when the day of my social circle’s gift exchange rolls around. Sarah gets a radio from Tom, Tom gets a sweater from Arthur...and Arthur will get, from me, an Aztec statue that comes to life in his hands. It’ll fit with his collection of action figures—if it doesn’t stab him first.

By the time I receive my own present, I don’t even care what crap I’m getting. I just want to hurry apart the parcel in my lap so Arthur can open his. While I tear off wrapping paper, I notice Arthur moving to greet someone at the patio door.

“Sorry to interrupt, everyone!” his bespectacled face announces. “My new girlfriend just got here!”

Plucking off the box’s ribbon, I listen absentmindedly as he continues.

“Even though we’ve only been going out for weeks, she *insisted* on doing Kris Kringle with us this year. Gloria even had me put her present in the pile this morning…”

Across the deck appears Madame Gloria, having arrived just in time to watch her Kris Kringle receive her gift. Only as the lid falls from my hands does realisation hit.

I nary have time to scream before an eruption of fireworks goes off right in my face."

I do not have any kind of powers at all but I have been accused of mental verbal abuse anyway. It started off with a little boy accusing me and saying that I have been saying horrible things to him with my so called mind powers. Everyone started to threaten me. I kept telling people that I don’t have any kind of mind powers but none of them seem to believe me. Everyday the little boy would make up more things of supposed things I have said to him through my mind. Horrid things in which I would never say at all.  


Then a little girl went to the authorities and told everyone that through my mind I was sending her horrid images to her mind. She went on to say that I was giving her nightmares at night and the things she drew on paper which she says were images I had sent her through my mind. I have no idea what to do and I don’t know how to prove that I don’t have mind powers of any kind.  


 The whole village was against me and I started getting threats from people of how they were going to chop off my head or throw me into the cage with some wild animal. Then a couple came forward and even though they were both adults, they too started telling everyone that I was saying horrible things to them through my mind powers and sending them decrepit images to their mind. Now it was even more colossal because it wasn’t just children accusing me but two grown adults.  


 I was lost and the idea of being hurt or punished for something I didn’t do was to horrific for me and unfair. I mean if I had done something actually horrible then I wouldn’t mind being punished or being sent to prison, because then I would actually deserve it. So I went up to the little boy, the little girl and the couple. I murdered all of them and mutilated their bodies and took pictures of it all and posted all over the village.  


 I am going to prison for it and most likely I am going to get murdered in prison but at least I deserve it, see I don’t mind it when I actually deserve it.  So to anyone on Thier death beds you now all know that I am telling the truth that I am not sending you horrid images or thoughts with my mind powers because I have no mind powers"

Then I panicked, even though I had gotten rid of the corpse, someone knew ... I hurriedly gave the answer sheet to my teacher and left the school. 

I looked around, on the stone sidewalk people were walking around but I managed to see the stranger, he was in a white building next to my school and he was hiding behind a tree, I could not see his face but I could see that he was wearing a black coat and he was holding a red umbrella even though it was not raining, it was the umbrella of the child I had hit !. I went towards him but the stranger had now disappeared.I felt that someone was watching me, I understood the presence of the stranger and finally the day I was waiting for came. As I closed my eyes to sleep I saw the stranger fleeing with the red umbrella entering my room and coming closer and closer to me ..."

I think that the boredom of the womb must have really gotten to me. As a child, my parents read all the same stories to me as the other parents to their children, but I never grew out of them. I couldn’t look at a gingerbread house without being envious of Gretel’s adventure. “So many people are trapped,” I thought, “that I must be able to save someone.” My ambitions softened in high school, especially as I learned the recent history of the lands of Perrault and Grimm.

I set my sights on something more scientific, cryptozoology. “The forest is so big,” I thought, “that there must be sasquatch somewhere.” I wasn’t just going to take blurry pictures or shaky videos. I was going to befriend a whole tribe of them. I’d teach them sign language like Koko and interview them for a documentary. I’d go on “Letterman” to promote the film, look into the camera, and tell all the kids who had stayed up past their bedtimes not to give up on their dreams. The world was my oyster, and then, within what felt like hours of graduation, the flesh was rotten, ants had carried the pearl away, and I was forty years old alone in the woods with a bigfoot whistle in my mouth and low tide in my nostrils.

Ghosts were next. Everybody knows someone with a ghost story. The great thing about ghosts is that people say that anything can be haunted. Buildings, rooms, cemeteries, roads, dolls, ships, and websites have all been declared haunted. “So many organisms have died on the earth,” I thought, “that there must be spirits somewhere.” I came closer to being arrested for trespassing that to seeing a ghost.

I was certain that I could tip the odds in my favor. Many cultures believe that the veil between the living and the dead thins at certain times and dates, but I found that the opacity was always total. If I wanted a peek, I was going to have to rip the cloth. My interests had always been adjacent to the occult, and I had befriended a few practitioners, but I was never desperate enough until I retired. I begged hell for a sign. I couldn’t die so unaccomplished.

When the sacrifices failed and my body withered, I wrote an autobiography, “Explorers on Mapped Terrain,” to warn others not to waste their lives. It sold well. Letterman had retired by then, but I advised any children watching my interviews on the other late-night shows to get STEM jobs and start families.

On my death bed, a doctor who was pioneering new techniques in cryonics came to me. I signed my body away on the condition that I wouldn’t be unfrozen before aliens had made first contact. I expected a dreamless sleep, but there’s something else in my icy nightmare. “Your soul is so big,” said the demon, “that I’ll never get bored.”"

The tie is now reaching towards you, like the palm of an unwelcome stranger extending their gnarled fingers out for a handshake. Dread creeps up from within as you now try to run, and trip over your own feet. 

And it lurches. Somehow boring its way through your flesh and winding its way around the tenuous bones of your ribcage. You hear snapping and a bile-churning crunch as your chest tightens to unbearable level. Trying to scream wouldn’t help, because even if you could, who would hear you? Who would even understand how to help? They’d just sit and scream with you or worse, they’d run themselves. 

Suddenly, and not nearly quickly enough all at the same time-it stops tightening. You lie in silence as seconds, a minute, five go by and steady your breathing. Stumbling to your feet, you pull desperately at your chest and panic once again upon the realization that it would be impossible to remove the tie without nearly killing yourself. 

And you resolve to live with it. But every now and then, the feeling creeps back again, tightening your tie and stealing away your air. So you lie in the dark, you punch the walls, you try to cut it out of you. Just try to remember that it will never truly go away, just ease its grip on you from time to time."

It was at the start of the year, on a path down the street. By the time I returned to the beginning of the path, it was nearly dusk, but I didn’t wanna go home yet. I wanted to see more.

Feeling adventurous, I made the decision to go off the path. There was a clearing nearby, and with the most recent snowfall having left a small blanket of white that looked entirely undisturbed, it was too tempting not to check out.

After crossing the wide space, which had a slight incline as it neared a hill up ahead, I spotted something odd. Between two huge rocks, obscured by foliage, was what looked like a hole. Pushing some of the brittle vines aside, I uncovered what, upon closer inspection, seemed to be a man-made tunnel. I took a few steps inside, kicking rocks and sticks aside, while holding my hands out. Realizing that the tunnel was longer than I thought, I turned my phone light on and continued.

The tunnel was long, and wide enough that I could walk through it easily. Up ahead, I saw what looked like doorways along sides of the tunnel. As I approached the first door, I found a flat wooden surface. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, so I started recording from my phone. “So I’m in this tunnel I found,” I whispered to myself, “and I have no idea what’s in here. I think there’s something on the other side of this, so I’m going to try to push it open.”

I tried to push against the wood, but it didn’t budge much. I stepped back and ran into it, shoulder first, and it gave way a little bit. “There’s definitely something here,” I said before slamming against the wood again.

A small space appeared at one end, like the wood was part of a door that had slightly opened. I looked inside, and could only see the glow of some kind of light. “I see a light,” I said, and from the other side of the door, someone screamed bloody murder.

Nearly dropping my phone in surprise, I ended the recording and ran out of the tunnel, pointing my phone’s light ahead of me. As I neared the entrance, I tripped on something. It felt like more rocks and sticks, but when I looked back, it was a skeleton. Near the skull, there was a small glint of metal. I grabbed it before running back to the trail.

I still have the pin I found, a metal lapel pin in the shape of a black rose. I found myself staring out at the snow today, holding the pin, wondering if I should bring it back to its owner- and more importantly, what’s waiting behind the doors, and where the man-made tunnel ends."

Nothing weird happened for a few days. Then I woke up with ""body_control.sight_input(restriction = ""living"").resting_bpm = 100"" under my neck.

On a whim, I videocalled my friend Matt who knew programming.

""Is this a tattoo?"" he asked.

""No! It appeared on my body this morning.""

He squinted at the words. ""Given the function names, I'd assume it takes the living things you see as input, and then makes their resting heart rate 100 bpm.""

""But you're the first person I saw!""

""Well, I think I'd notice if my heart rate was that high, so at least you know it doesn't work."" He smiled. ""But on the other hand, you'd need to run the code for it to work - ""

Something surged through my body and Matt gasped, putting his hand to his heart. He hung up and that evening, he called back to say he was taking drugs to lower his heart rate.

""Don't worry,"" he replied to my apology. ""I think I'll be fine.""

The next day, the text was replaced by ""body_control.hearing_input(restriction = ""living"").contract()"". I e-mailed Matt about the text, and he replied, *I guess you should try not to hear anybody.*

*Sure,* I replied. As I sent the e-mail, the surge hit me again, and I nervously paced around.

""Calm down,"" I told myself before a sharp pain ran through me. I instinctively looked down and saw ""AttributeError: 'body' object has no attribute 'contract'"" on my stomach in red text.

I called Matt and said, ""I don't think it's working anymore. It sent out an error!"" When he didn't respond, I asked, ""Is something wrong?""

Energy ran through me, and when his dog barked in the background, whining rapidly followed. Matt shouted and then screamed.

I looked down, and to my horror, the error message was gone and the line was now ""body_control.hearing_input(restriction = ""living"").*stomach*.contract()"".

He and the dog could no longer digest food due to their permanently-contracted stomachs, and I heard they died after a few days. I isolated myself (easy to do in these times) so now whenever the code runs, it can only affect me. I've vomited and shat myself countless times since, but it seems whoever makes the code cares about my well-being enough to keep me alive.

I've learned more about computer science so I don't end up killing again, but I can't seem to change the text written on me. I can write over it, but every time the code runs, those markings disappear. I've also tried removing the code by cutting it out of my skin, but it extends into the muscle beneath.

I see no option besides beheading myself, so I can't take in information anymore and the lack of an import statement renders the code useless."

A little bit of hair growing in that sunken part off the bridge of my nose, in between my eyes.

But it got big. It started getting stuck in my vision as it collapsed onto my eye, and getting sniffled up into my nostril, even falling down into my mouth at times. I'd wake up some nights, feeling it inside my nose, as it snuck down onto the back of my tongue.

Sometimes, and I couldn't tell if it was the tickle of the hair or not, I could start to feel an odd bumping sensation around the part where it grew out.

I tried tugging at it, but that hurt too much to bother with, and when I did, the bumping sensation would increase by tenfold, like I had agitated it.

It got much worse. The bumps became scratches under my skin, like something was trying to claw it's way out. I even felt it behind my eyes and on the top of my throat. The hair, at this point, started to dangle past my chin, and even reached my collarbone when I hung my head slightly. I'd end up gasping for air when it found my throat, triggering my gag reflex.

Enough was enough. Fuck the pain. I'm ripping this out.

I grabbed it with both hands and pulled. It hurt, god did it hurt, but I was determined. Whatever the *hell* was inside of me was coming out.

Blood started to pour from where the hair began, drenching the thing as more of it came out.

The scratching became more erratic and frantic, as rips started to form in my cheek, with more of the hairs peeking through them. A screeching sound emerged from my own mouth, but I couldn't tell if it was the thing or me making them.

And then the wound bloated as it's body started to collide against my skin. But I pulled
 And pulled. And pulled.

With a sharp crackle, it popped out. Long and gangly, a spider of 100 legs, it creeped around my hand as I held it, desperately trying to claw it's way back in with wails. As blood ran down my face and onto my chest, I rushed into the bathroom, and rinsed it down the drain in the shower.

1 hospital trip later I had scars upon scars on my face. The thing had ended up tearing my entire cheek out and a skin graft was needed. But it was done. No more creatures.

I headed home, glad that that was done, and started to change into my pyjamas.

But I noticed something. A hair, not unlike the one on my nose...

Had started to show on my chest."

I got to the bottom and headed for the electricity box. Then it started. A loud clanging sound echoed around my head, getting louder with every step. It was deafening, inescapable. Fuck this.

I turned around and made my way back to the stairs. That’s when i stopped hearing the clanging sounds, but instead, a light whisper.

I took one step up the stairs and again, it got louder, but this time it was behind me. I turned to see if i could see the source of the sound, but there was nothing. From this point on i continued to walk up the stairs backwards.

On the last few steps it turned to screams, cries of pain, except for the last step.

It all stopped. The whispers and the screams. It was replaced with something worse. Breath brushed the back of my neck. It was already at the top, waiting for me. It was already too late."
klzvm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klzvm1/pies/,Pies,68,2,1609192198.0,"I clean my hands as I hallucinate a disgustingly yellow painting of a smiling sun projected onto the tabletop. I shake it off, and since it's already floured, I start working on the dough. Shaping it had always been my favorite part of making the pies, ever since I was a young girl; my mind briefly goes to my mom and I, standing in the kitchen, making pies together. I repeat her movements, both in my memory and now, throwing the dough around the table, although more out of muscle memory from all the years I've done this. 

It's hot. Makes sense, since the oven is preheating right in front of me. But a hot climate has always given me allergies, so not really a personal favorite. We only make the pies when it's hot, too. Whatever, the shaped dough rolls out of my hands and to the sides, and I focus on finding the meat. 

My nose itches as I reach for the fridge. It reminds me of how Dylan used to scratch his nose all the time back when he was sick. Everytime I make pies I think of him. When I asked my mom, she said he had the flu, but that the elders would take care of him. I prayed for him a lot back then. 

No meat on the fridge. I sigh. The yellow sun from earlier is back and it seems to be taunting me. Might as well shape the dough a bit more before getting the meat. 

I remember the first time my mother taught me how to make pies and told me how important they were to us. They sold well, sure, when the men would go to the few dirt roads we had near our isolated community to sell them to hungry travelers, but that wasn't their main goal. 

I leave the soon to be pies stacked neatly and head to the room next to the kitchen. There's no inscriptions on the door indicating where it would lead to; only a yellow sun. The same sun I saw when my mom took me here years ago.

I open the door to the morgue. 

The smell takes me back instantly to when I was first here. I was crying. Asking why we had to do this. My mom hugged me and told me that was our only way of containing the flu. If we didn't do this, it would ravage us entirely. 

I grab the nearest body, and his face reminds me of Dylan's that day: disgustingly yellow, in a contorted, painful smile.

I head back to finish the pies."

klwvtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klwvtc/religion_isnt_a_cult/,Religion Isn’t a Cult,56,2,1609182976.0,"Hello there! Let me be the first to say, we are so glad you have joined us! It takes a lot of courage to come to a new group for the first time. Despite what you may have heard, religion isn’t a cult! It’s a group of like minded people celebrating the life He lent us! Please follow these rules so that you remain safe on our campus.

1. Be here by 6pm every Wednesday night. If the youth pastor catches you coming in late, he will make you sit in the storage room the entire service. We aren’t sure what it is about this room, but people usually seem different after they come out. 

2. We take communion at the start of service each week. Most congregations use grape juice as a symbol of the blood. Here, we take a volunteer and drink from them directly. Do not be afraid. It is a great honor in His eyes. 

3. Never take His name in vain lest your tongue be cut from your head. You don’t want to become part of our collection.

4. Baptism is only offered on the third Sunday of each month. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar. If you believe them, you will stay in the waters of baptism forever. 

5. If you find yourself on the second floor at any point during the service, stay away from room 112. There was a fire there many years ago during Sunday school, and the children who are still there are dying to make new friends. 

6. One thing we learn is that, “The dark does not like the light because it exposes their evil deeds.” Therefore, never enter a darkened room. Your presence will bring great offense to entities there. 

7. You will be asked to stay after the service and help clean up from the night’s festivities. During this, you will be alone much of the time. Be sure to turn on lights in each room before you enter, and announce your presence no matter how silly it feels. No room is ever empty. 

8. When you are alone in the church, you may get the feeling someone or something is following you. Do not panic unless you hear footsteps. If you hear them, run to the nearest room, and shut the door. You won’t have time to turn on the lights and announce your presence. However, it will be much worse for you if the thing that’s following you catches you.  

9. The youth pastor loves to make his sermons come to life, so he often likes to use volunteers as actors in his stories. Be sure to not volunteer when he is talking about the crucifixion of Christ. 

10. There is a woman named Lilith who wanders the 1st floor, and she will appear as a helpless old woman. Do not approach her under any circumstances. Take extra precaution if you are a female. Lilith was the first woman, and she despises competition."
klvb3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klvb3z/my_plan/,My Plan,29,3,1609178243.0,"So, I have a bit of a problem. A business problem. I inherited the business from my father, who inherited it from his parents. Well, my older sister inherited first, but she died...and nearly destroyed our home. I don't want to talk about it. I've run the business well for a while, but it's very big for one being to run. And the workforce is dwindling. I just can't force my employees not to leave. I've tried to pick up the slack where and when I can, but I'm only one being. The workforce problem is especially bad when combined with my other problem.

Hell is asses and elbows. There's tons and tons of people down here. There is **a death every 10 seconds!** You can literally go to hell for liking your reflection too much! I love torturing the wicked, but the workload is overwhelming me, and more importantly, my employees. So I've started letting more people than I probably should go to Purgatory. Mostly people with unaddressed disabilities and other medical issues that drove them to violence. Though they're definitely in there a while, they'll get to Heaven eventually, and immediately stop being my problem. But I have a plan to better lessen the workload.

Make them the human's problem.

I'll start with ten or fifteen Wicked Souls, and send out a few trusted demons to watch them from a distance. I'll give the Wicked Souls new bodies, with all or most of their original memories, and allow them to pick their own new names. Give them back a sense of ownership over themselves. I'll put them near the places where they committed their wrongdoings, and set them up to make up for the wrongdoings. For example, a child abuser might be given the task of comforting children abused by their parents. When I get to more recent arrivals in hell, I might give Wicked Souls the task of watching over their real grandchildren. I'll turn these Wicked Souls into perfect gar-ga-gardi...guardian a-angels. And if they falter and start to do wrong again, my demons will swoop in and remind them what they'll go back to if they mess up."

“You all know what you came here for! But before we get into it, a short word from our fantastic Police Chief: Mr Christopher Haze!” The crowd claps while some boo the appearance of the police chief onto the stage.

“Thank you all” the police chief looks slightly hesitant in front of the crowd, possibly due to the booing. “Thank you for coming tonight to the lottery, this is the fifth anniversary so I’m very happy you’re all here to experience it. I would like to remind all of you in attendance of the amazing work of our police force and to the ingenuity of you, our village members, in creating this yearly event as it’s impact on fighting our crime within the village has brought unprecedented success” the crowd uproars in cheer again as the clapping and whistling repeats.

“Now I won’t take up much more of your time, I just want to say a huge thank you to you all for giving hope back to our community. Have a good evening folks, thank you” clapping emanates across the vast crowd of eager villagers as one screams out ‘let’s get on with it’ as the main speaker appears on stage again.

“I know you’re all very excited so, with great pleasure, I announce we will now begin the lottery!” As the lights brighten the stage three crew members bring out the lottery wheel. The speaker spins the wheel and all the balls rattle inside, plunging and tumbling on top of each other until eventually the contraption is stopped and a winner is pulled from the top.

“Now before we reveal the winner let’s not forget what the prize is this year. Throughout our time in this wonderful village there have been people seeking to disrupt the peace. Some we give a slap on the wrist, but others...well they deserve something a bit extra. And the family that is going to give that punishment issss...” the crowd rises in voice as the rattling of drums builds suspension.

“The Johnson family! Get on up here folks!” The Johnson family excitedly rush on stage as some clap in excitement while others stand in disappointment. The Johnson family take up their position on the stage, they give the thumbs up to the main speaker and the curtain is dropped at the back of the stage, revealing three men and one woman with nooses around their necks.

There was only a minute left now, and I gave up on trying. She was probably hanging out with someone from school or something. Now I was alone.

I gasped. Silver stood right behind me, a smile on her face.

""I've been looking for you! Where have you been?"" I gently punched her shoulder.

""Listen, I'm sorry.""

""What could you possibly be sorry about, Silver? There's nothing wrong.""

""I'm sorry you'll have to go through it again."" Silver's eyes were still glued to the clock. Fifteen seconds remaining.

""What do I have to go through again? Is there something you're not telling me? Silver?""

""You thought you survived. You thought everyone just left you on your birthday, on new years, all alone. You thought that they didn't want you. It wasn't that. You just didn't live.""

I saw a girl, standing across the street. She waved at me. I waved back. She seemed familiar, but I didn't remember her.

My heart misses a beat. I have dreaded hearing this for twenty five years. I sit down, facing my husband across the table; my perfect, wonderful husband, who scooped me up from mundanity one day in high school, said all the right words, made all the right moves, and made my life enchanted. We’ve been through college, marriage, and the birth of two sons. I barely ever had any reason to complain. I must confess I was not so infallible myself, but he stood by me despite my mistakes. I kept hearing warnings, from my mom – *it’s too good to be true;* my dad – *you should get your act together*; my friends – *he’s hiding something*; his friends – *you don’t deserve him*; Truth is, their words only echoed my fears. I did not and still don’t understand how I was so lucky. At some point, I just accepted it.

“Is it about James?” I ask. Has to be about James. The one day I felt prey to lust and dared ask the question *what if it had been another?* I climbed into bed with a charming stranger and ten horrid minutes later climbed down and ran out to confess the whole thing to the man of my life. He could have yelled at me, but he just shook his head and smiled like he understood, and I loved him back all the more for it.

He’s shaking his head now with the same smile “No, it’s not that.”

Yet, we’re having *The Talk*. Whatever the reason, it is bad. I see he’s writing sentences in his minds, pondering each word. My heart is sinking. I’m going to be heartbroken, but it’s okay even if we break up. Couples divorce all the time. We’re going to be adults about it and do what’s right for our kids.

“I once married a wonderful woman” he begins “and she made the right man out of me…”

Humble, as always.

“…We weren’t perfect, but we stood together. Yet, In the back of my head, I always wondered how life could have been with my high school crush…”

Who is he talking about? That’s me.

He looks me dead in the eyes “…That’s you.”

I don’t understand.

“Back when I was 42 I found a class photo of ’95 with you on it and I remembered how lovely you were. I made a careless wish.”

But he’s 41.

“And I got it. I went back to being a teenager in 1995, and I lived my whole life a second time, with the experience of a grown man. I made no mistake. I got everything I wanted back then. I got you. But that’s not the same. It’s not as good. It’s not real.”

I can’t talk. I can’t even breathe.

“This is the night I made my wish. I miss my wife and my daughter. I’m going back.”

“What? When?”

“Any second now. I spared you as long as possible”

klsa7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klsa7y/emily/,Emily,2363,93,1609168569.0,"Jennifer Harrison wanted to be a mommy so badly. She and her boyfriend had done everything right to conceive and after she'd done so, she tried to do everything right to make sure she had a healthy baby.

&#x200B;

That was why she'd called me. She told me I'd been recommended by a friend of hers. I'm a midwife, you see and I love what I do. I like being able to help people bring beautiful new lives into this world. I've even helped with home births, for those who wanted them. Some people like Jennifer, believe that they are more comfortable… Which isn’t untrue. However, if there are complications, like with her birth, things can go very wrong.

&#x200B;

I won’t go into the messy details. Just know that Jennifer’s little girl was stillborn. I assured her that I did the best I could and I think she truly believed that. 

&#x200B;

Losing a baby isn’t easy. I know that firsthand. Long ago, when I was young and stupid, I made the mistake of getting pregnant. I was still in high school. Just a teenager, but I was determined to take responsibility for my baby. I would’ve done just that if fate hadn’t been so cruel… No… Not fate… People. Teenage ‘sluts’ aren’t looked kindly upon and kids can be mean even at the best of times. I’m sure some people might have said that it was an accident that I ‘fell’ down the stairs at school and miscarried. But I knew I’d been pushed. People told me it was for the best, but I don’t believe that. I’ve never been able to conceive since, nor have I been able to forget the new life that died inside of me… 

&#x200B;

I’m sure Jennifer forgot, though. After all, she didn’t even recognize me once during the months where I helped her prepare for the baby she’d never have. She didn’t even seem to remember what she’d done to me. What she’d taken from me all those years ago…

&#x200B;

It was blind luck that brought us back together. Blind luck that allowed me to show her the pain I had been through because of her.

&#x200B;

But she’ll remember me soon enough. As I said, I understand Jennifer's grief. I know what it’s like to lose a baby. That’s why I invited her over to my place tonight for dinner. She probably thinks I pity her. I don’t. I simply want to remind her of our shared history and I’ve got the perfect meat roasting in the oven for us to indulge in. I must admit, preparing it was very simple. Not all that different from making a Thanksgiving turkey or a roast chicken. I know Jennifer won’t care for it once she finds out what it is, which is a real shame. After all, she’s technically the one who supplied it. I think she was going to name it Emily."

This christmas I got a really good present from my uncle. He normally gives the best presents, but this year he went way overboard. Last year he gave me the best, pinkest princess dress, but this year is even better. I’ve been sending Santa hundreds of letters asking for it, but he didn’t listen. But then the next day uncle visited us and gave me the giant, plush teddy bear. I was so happy! It was almost as big as I am and has a really cute bow tie. 

I was really happy with it the first few days. We played together, had tea parties and just had a lot of fun. I even gave him a name: mister Teddy! But then he started acting weird. He started making weird noises. It sounded like some kind of humming. After the humming his eyes started to glow red. Not the whole eye, just a little red dot. 

I don’t like Teddy anymore. I told mommy this, but she says I shouldn’t be so ungrateful. Teddy always stops when mommy or daddy comes into my room. They don’t believe me when I say he acts weird. 

I tried trowing Teddy away, but daddy won’t let me. I tried putting Teddy in the closet, but mommy takes him out and sets him on my bed when I do that. Teddy keeps staring at me with his red eyes. Please take him away. I don’t want Teddy anymore!"

Jordan repeated this fact to himself often. It became a mantra that he clutched close like a security blanket on a windy night. The only problem being that the perfectly normal yellow wallpaper kept changing. 

It started with the pattern. Jordan was washing his hands, staring at his pale face and puffy eyes in the mirror, when he felt a *shift*. The feeling was similar to vertigo, over in an instant. 

Maybe it was only his imagination, Jordan thought. Then he noticed that the horizontal lines on the faded wallpaper were now vertical. He was sure, *positive*, that they were not always vertical. Well, 99-percent sure. 

Jordan leaned in close to the wall, squinting. That’s when the smell hit him. Stale air and ammonia. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d cleaned the downstairs bathroom but now it reeked of freshness. Bleach. Flowers. Jordan took a deep breath and gagged. Under the cloying sweetness, something was rotting. 

The pattern shifted again. Now small white flowers twisted across the top of the wallpaper and Jordan could hear the sound of sobbing. He ran from the bathroom and hid upstairs. But the sound grew louder, deafening, until Jordan couldn’t ignore it. He ran back to the bathroom.

The wallpaper was completely transformed now. Instead of being a ragged yellow, it was clean blue. The flower work at the edges was delicate, detailed, familiar. All of it was familiar but Jordan couldn’t remember why. Only that it had something to do with his grandmother.

Now that the door was open, the sobbing was louder. The sound filled the small bathroom but seemed to be coming from the mirror. Jordan inched into the room and froze. There was no reflection in the mirror. Instead, Jordan was looking *up* through an open door into a different room. He saw the same blue wallpaper with the pretty at the edge of his vision. Above him was a white ceiling.

A shadow crossed his vision. As the form leaned down, Jordan recognized the red, weeping face of his sister. He tried to reach out but found his body locked, stuck in position looking out through the open door. As his sister walked away, the door began to close. 

Jordan was frozen. He tried to turn away but there was no mirror anymore. Only the closing door and the shrinking sliver of ceiling and wallpaper. As the world went black, Jordan finally realized why that wallpaper looked so familiar. He’d seen it before when he was a child, not long after his grandmother had died.

Until she got pregnant, then she started complaining that her unborn baby daughter was an alcoholic and also had an addiction to ciggarettes. She started to smoke and drink alcohol and at the same time she would sob uncontrollably. She would shout out loud that her unborn baby daughter had the addiction and she could feel it. My father constantly shouted at her and scolded her for harming the health of his future wife. 

Then my sister started to claim that her baby daughter now had a new addiction while still inside her womb. She didn't tell us what it is though at first but this new addiction was an addition to the other two addictions. We could all hear her sobbing whenever she was drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. We were all wondering what her new third addiction was? and my father kept on saying that she better not be harming the future health of his future wife any further. 

We then found my sister in the alley way eating a homeless man, the homeless man was dead and it now looked like her unborn baby daughter had a strong taste for human meat. She has been taken away to be examined. Something is wrong really wrong."

One moment, they were on a supply run, not far from the compound; And then the next, Gwen awoke on a hard cement floor, her head pounding. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she scanned the room for her friends, panic bubbling up in her chest when the realization hit that they weren't with her. She called out to them, though tears rolled down her cheeks when the only response she got was her echoing voice. She curled in on herself, sobbing quietly as her mind raced. She wanted to know Ophelia and Luci were alive. But her thoughts wandered to the darkest pits.

The first week there, Gwen had gotten her confirmation that Ophelia was alive. They had thrown the girl into the cell with her. She spent her free time huddled up with her, only being ripped away when the men came in, cutting away flesh from the girls bodies, leaving gore in their wake. Snow fell that week. Gwen held Ophelia during those long, cold nights. They were fed once a day, mainly scraps, it wasn't much, but it was enough. Gwen kept on fighting, for herself, for Ophelia, for Luci.

During the second week, she heard Luci's screams, a confirmation that her friend was alive, but suffering. This made Gwen fight harder. She had saved a fork from the last meal they were given, waiting for her opportunity to attack; When the men returned, she stabbed one in the thigh, hoping to cause enough of a distraction for escape. But while she was fast, they were faster. Gwen's hand was removed for that, the men took their turns pulling teeth from her afterwards.

The third week, Gwen was losing her fight, the light in her eyes quickly fading. She numbed herself to the pain the men brought her, learned to tune out her friends cries just to spare herself the heartbreak. She knew it was selfish, but she couldn't bare to listen to Ophelia's pleas. Gwen had watched the stump that used to be her hand, change, surely it was an infection. Though, rationally, she knew it was just healing. But rational thought had left her. It had been three days since she last heard a noise from Luci, she couldn't accept that her friend was dead.

By the fourth week, Gwen was a shell of her former self, she didn't fight back when the men came, with their rusty tools, and sadistic grins. Her stump was turning black, and she was growing violently ill. She sobbed quietly to herself, curled up in the corner of the freezing, dark room. She held no hope of Luci being alive, and all she wanted now was the release death would bring. The only problem was Ophelia, she couldn't leave her alone in this mess. Gwen stared at the rusty fork in front of her, she had to do something. Something that would free them both of this torment..."

klo2rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klo2rq/voices_in_my_head/,Voices in my head,511,13,1609151286.0,"I heard them all. I heard the screams of pain and cries for help. I heard them mostly during night time, when the moon is up and darkness surrounds my little house on the farm. I also heard them during daylight though more seldom. The voices sounded like they’re from teenage girls asking for help. *Where am I? Somebody help me!* Once, I heard a voice saying she’s in the basement and I spent *hours* looking for her in my basement. Of course, she’s not there. Of course, these voices are just in my head. Who else will they belong to? I am the only one living in the house since my husband and daughter died in that tragic car crash a year ago.

In this rural place, I am lucky to have a neighbor while the other houses are miles away from ours. They are an old couple who are just so warm and friendly, I wished they were my parents. I confided in them during my worst days and they recommended I see their daughter who happens to be the best psychiatrist in town.

Months of therapy and loads of pills later, I can somehow manage to get by day to day without the voices. My psychiatrist also tells me the voices I am hearing are manifestations of guilt to something that isn’t my fault. I couldn’t save my own daughter from dying and it’s important to accept that.

I thought I was getting better until the incident that happened one night. I heard a plea for help, but this time loud enough that I am sure that came from my back door. I hurried towards the door and saw one of the most horrific things I have ever seen. A teenage girl, with a pale and thin face and body dressed in white evening gown, pleading for my help. I ran to my bedroom as quickly as I could. I waited for myself to calm down until I realised she might be real. I headed back but I didn’t see anyone anymore. I searched and searched in vain.

That was when I decided to turn myself into 24/7 psychiatric care. It has been two weeks and I think I’m back on my feet again. I have to move on and possibly move to a new place. I love my husband and my daughter but I want to remember my most cherished memories of them, not the last tragic ones that I didn’t even see.

Armed with new hope and a plan, I went back to my house. The first thing I noticed were the police cars by my neighbor’s house. I asked a police officer afterwards. Twelve bodies of teenage girls were found burried in their backyard. Brutally tortured and held captive by my neighbors for weeks, one by one. I fell unconscious but I wouldn't forget that officer's last words to me, *“I’m quite surprised that you haven’t seen or heard anything.”*"

So the simple fact that she trusted me enough to hold my hand as we got on was amazing, after all, I am the pilot, so she should know that she can trust me.

She walked on board with our two-year-old son Jamey, and I made sure she got the window seat. She might not like flying, but who can resist a good view of the city from up in the sky.

I made sure she was comfortable before I went up to the cockpit and made sure to tell the flight attendants to take extra special care with her. I'm betting she is going to have a wonderful time with the wine menu and all the little first-class items. Nothing's to good for my lovely Lulu, my pet name for her.

After taking off I made sure that she was ok and that everyone in first class was alright. I have known my copilot Kevin for years now, he won't let anything bad happen. I dipped into the food cart on my way back and took a bread roll and butter, I can't resist a snack on longer flights sometimes, and first-class always gets the nice silverware.

Me and Kevin had been best friends for years then, he was like my brother, which is why it hurt so much what I had to do to him.

When I got back into the cockpit and locked the door, I finished my bread roll and took the plane into a nosedive. The tower was yelling through Kevin's headset, but he wasn't going to respond, having a butter knife in your throat will do that to you sometimes. I just had to make sure that he was dealt with first, him and my cheating bitch of a wife deserve this sort of thing to happen to them, along with that little piece of shit they try to tell me is my son.

As I stared at the glass case the bodies of three people incased of wooden figures or curved doll shapes.

The description of the display said this: “ Back in 13th century families used large wooden doll like figures to bury their dead. Like modern day urns. Unlike modern day urns these dolls or capsules were created with stacking and uniform figures in mind. Families would be buried together and stacked from smallest to the largest. These became the inspiration for the childhood toy the Russian dolls.” 

I laugh and I took many pictures of the cases and the way the bodies fitted inside. They emptied all of the organs like they do in Egypt. I smile as I had my next way of showcasing my next murders. The most innocent of things always has the darkest of inspirations. Russian dolls are no exception. A wonderful creation will be made from this idea. And I know just the right person to start. 

You will have the inside scoop on how I make this project and that’s to die for. Just got to squeeze you inside and there you go.

Blueberries. They sound lovely don't they unless you've had one. Then they're just over-hyped baby grapes. Expectation ruins things. I'm waiting next to my house, for a guy I met at Whole Foods today morning. I remember his childish grin when I slipped my number into his cart. Now, I'm looking to be swept away by a man in a dorky flannel shirt driving a Honda something. And then he arrives, our own Caeser, from the expensive grocery store. After much thought, we decide to go to a sushi place three blocks away. Sushi is exaggerated blueberry, but I don't tell him that, I smile and tell him about its Japanese origin and core flavors. He has cat-like eyes and a not-here-not-there gaze. I wanna like this man, I really do. We talk through dinner, and I ask him to drop me home. I've gotta give this guy another chance.

    Now, back at home, I'm looking at my collection of silverware, wondering if I should clean them again. I decide against it and go to bed.

    Last night was fun, I dreamt of all sorts of things. I'm walking over to work now. I'm gonna meet the guy again today, for lunch. Lunch wouldn't have been my first choice, but I love a challenge. 

    We're meeting at a burger place he likes, this is gonna be fun. He's already waiting for me when I get there. We jabber through lunch. I watch as he bites his burger, and grins giddily. I ask him to drop me back at work. I'd like for him to know more about me. 

    We drive by the sushi place, we're a couple of blocks into the lane when he says, ""Do you realize you have barely blinked in quite a while"". I smile shyly. Blink. ""Oh, that's a nervous tick"". Blink. Blink. ""You're cute"". Blink.

    We reach my place of work, I ask him to come in and look around.  I show him around the place, then I take him into my cabin. I'm proud of this room, it's a reflection of who I am.

Now, he seems quite stirred. There's a skip in his step when I open the door. He looks edgy and pale. He touches everything with caution, as though they may bite at him. ""I didn't know you were this savvy."", he says.

Then he starts walking toward me, this is going according to plan. I'm ready for this, haven't done it in a while, and seems sooner than usual, but I'm ready. 

He's one step away from me now, looking right into my eyes. Do I make the first move? Do I savor the moment, to savor better things later? 

His hand cradles towards mine, I feel a ping of nervousness. 

He whispers into my ear, his hand in mine, ""You know I bought this set, right?"". Is he lying? Do I take the risk?. ""I did, these are fake. Do you not believe me?"" Do I? Good god, I believe him. But do I care? Meh, I bite at his neck. He's convulsing but I gotta do this before he's a goner. Fake set huh?! What an addition to my rendition. I carve them with a silver knife and place them on the glass shelf on the wall. 

I'm proud of this room, it's a reflection of my obsession. 

Teeth and tongue never ceased to fascinate me."

She was getting up in years but I was hoping to get one more calf off her. She had fallen down and couldn't get up. It was either put her out of her misery or let the coyotes get her. Its easy enough to shoot something when its already as good as dead.

Growing up on my Grandparents' ranch was the only thing almost normal about my childhood. My mother was their only child and I was the closest thing Grandpa ever had to a son, so as a young girl I spent my days ranching with my Grandpa.

I can only assume my father was just like all the other dirt bags my mom had for boyfriends. We rarely saw her; she would occasionally show up to stay when she was out of money. She had a different boyfriend every time she visited, and they were always addicts just like her.

One time Grandpa caught one of her boyfriends trying to get close to me. He threw them both out and I never saw my mother again.

Grandmother passed when I was 14, then it was just Grandpa and me. Cattle prices were down. BSE, Anthrax, always something. Life was tough, but we managed. 

Soon Grandpa was more confused than ever. He started calling me Marian, my Grandmother's name. He forgot to pay bills. He left the stove on. When I finally found a nursing home for him it was for the best, I had been running the ranch myself for years anyway.

The home was terrible for Grandpa, and it cost me 1200 a month I didn't have. He became withdrawn, even violent at times. I visited when I could; he would tell the nurses Marian was coming. Dementia wards are understaffed, so it was no surprise when Grandpa started to escape, he kept doing it more and more often. I couldn't blame the nurses, its tough to be security guards when they are swamped with patients.

When he would escape, it usually wasn't long and he'd find his way to the ranch. He'd lived there his whole life after all. I found him one time sleeping in the barn after he'd forgotten the gate open. I lost nearly ten head that day. I took him back to the home, and I cried the entire drive home.

Today when he wandered back to the ranch I decided to do things differently. I dug out one of my Grandmother's old dresses and cooked a home style supper. We ate, and talked. He only called me Marian. I packed a bag and we went for a walk to check the herd.

We were halfway there when he remarked how nice the herd looked. The day was drawing to a close and a beautiful pastel of pink was hanging low over the foothills.

I pulled my .357 from the bag. Its easy enough to shoot something when its already as good as dead."

He grabs you the same way he often does: violently. His grip hurts more than usual, because it overlaps with a bruise he left on you last night. “Hurry! We’ll miss the connection!”

He drags you along. Your eyes widen as you pass through Concourse Two. Clothes are strewn about. Sounds of ecstasy mix with cries of intense pain. A massive circle of filthy, naked bodies rub against each other on a stained, rough carpet.

An escalator brings you to Concourse Three. You cover your nose at the scent of the expired meat that men and women dig through piles of maggots to obtain.

Roger finally releases you on the moving walkway. You know that when you get to your destination, he’ll change. He’ll finally be the boyfriend you’ve always wanted. 

You glide through Concourse Four. Sharply-dressed men preside over forts of unclaimed luggage. A man in a paper crown writes on a napkin.

Those in Concourse Five have divided into factions. They scream at you and at each other. Roger screams back until he is out of breath.

Roger flags down an employee, who looks at his ticket and drives you in a golf cart through the Concourse Six. Its denizens, dressed in cassocks, white robes, mitres, and ornate tunics, sit quietly in sad confusion.

Concourse Seven is engulfed in warfare. Men claw at each other with plastic knives. The orders that arrive on paper napkins are always the same: attack.

The golf cart is toppled. A bleeding man stumbles onto your path. Roger stomps on his skull. Blood and bone fragment spill onto your dress.

You cross a bridge. In Concourse Eight, you see people you recognize from the TVs in Concourse One. Even as they are shackled, bound, and tortured, they cry out about “the steal,” “crisis actors,” and pedophiles lurking in basements.

The pathway becomes eerily quiet. Few people have made it this far. “We’re almost there,” pants your sweating boyfriend.

Concourse Nine is a bloodbath. The teeth of those frozen in place gnash and grind. Winged creatures gnaw on flesh. Another strips skin from a man counting small shards of silver.

You navigate obstacles and reach the gate. “Did we make it?” asks Roger to the auburn-haired attendant. You hand her your tickets.

She reads them and beckons you forward. Roger tries to follow, but her tail swings and digs its sharp end into his back. He is pulled away. “Stay with me!” he cries.

You don’t know whether to stay or go. The attendant watches in amusement. “Concourse Nine is for traitors. He’s betrayed his values. Have you betrayed yours?”

You board. As the plane ascends into warm white light, you don’t think about what and who you left behind."

Mommy found out I went to the balcony and she was sooo upset. She closed all the curtains so I couldn't see the sun anymore and today was also such a pretty sunny day!! She told me to not go anymore. But I'm adventurous! (I just learned that's how you spell it). So I went back and saw the tall man again!! He was standing still just like the last time but this time he was smiling from ear to ear. I wonder what he thought was so funny. I waved at him again.

Dear Diary,

Mommy is so upset these days and she keeps asking me if I've been to the balcony again and I keep telling her no. I feel bad for lying but I think she would be more upset if I told her the truth. Not angry upset! She just seems scared and I don't wanna worry her. 

I know you know I'm writing this from the balcony but today is the last day I'm coming here because it was the most sunny out of all days!! I couldn't miss it!!

 I must be going crazy. I had ignored the sound the first few nights I heard it, believing it to just be the creaking of the old Post Office.

The past few nights I've worked late shifts and had to get my mail at night. Our town is small and our only option is to get our mail at our local Post Office building. Everyone is assigned boxes with numbers displayed above small dirty glass windows. The mail is left in those boxes every day around noon.

I pulled up around 11 pm, parked, and walked up to the doors feeling a tiny pang of nervousness that made my heart beat a little faster. I walked inside and realized I was alone. I hurredly checked my box, number 212 and saw some mail through the small glass window. I quickly opened my box and got the assortment of junk mail and bills. When I began to leave I heard that damned tapping again. I stopped and listened it was so faint that I didn't know exactly where it was coming from but it seemed like it was close.

*tap*

 I followed the sound and when I was getting closer the tapping grew more rushed and so did my heart beat.
I was determined to figure out what that sound was and why did it keep happening when I was alone at night.

It became a continuous quick tapping as I came to a row of boxes in the 400s

I followed the row with my eyes. 401, 402, 403, 404. When my eyes landed on 405 the tapping stopped and the small metal door slowly creaked open nearly giving me a damn heart attach.

Inside the small dark box I saw a pale finger with a bright blood red nail and it beckoned to me. Everything in me wanted to run but I was able to take a few steps closer.
The hand slowly drew back into the darkness within.
 I could hear a hoarse whisper. 

""Please help me.""

I then saw through the square metal tube the eye and hollow cheek of a girl that I recognized. She was a girl in our town that had went missing two months ago."

The more walls we put up, the more trapped we became. I’m grateful for that. I wouldn’t wish what happened to us on anyone. 

The apocalypse started thanks to *Actias luna:* Luna moths. They’re native to North America. Canada and Mexico did a good job containing their borders, turning the tables on us, and trapping us in our misery. 

Luna moths are large insects with wingspans of 4.5 inches. They’re bright green; their bodies are covered with eyespots to scare predators; their wings have long green tails. The infectious agent was contained in the powder on their wings. 

Our infrastructure was overrun too quickly to determine why it had the effect of turning us into moth-like creatures that devoured each other like an invasive species set on an apple orchard. But this story is not about Luna moths. It’s about one doctor’s attempt to help his fellow citizens despite the futility of doing so.

I was evading mothmen when I came upon a Rite-Aid pharmacy. It had been raided, but I found an untouched note posted on the window.

\*\*\*

**Managing Your Metamorphosis**

by Dr. Tom Ricks, Rite-Aid Pharmacist

There is no cure for the Luna Moth Illness, but I’d like to advise self-care during your transformation. As my condition deteriorated, I experimented, finding remedies worth sharing.

**1. The Brain:** Before anything else, your cognitive wires will cross. Powder from the Lunas covers your synapses, creating antennae that sprout through your skull. There’s no cure, but caffeine pills help. We keep them by the pharmacy. 

**2. The Heart:** Think of your body as a plant-like organism. During the metamorphosis, your heart becomes a rotten seed. It continues beating but spreads the disease through your body. You’ll feel the most excruciating heartburn you’ve ever felt. Drink three parts Pepto Bismol to one part whiskey.

3. **The Stomach:** You will lose control of your bowels –– the plumbing will spring leaks. There’s nothing much to do here, but despite our lack of toilet paper, we still had adult diapers last I checked.

4. **The Legs:** Mothmen fly and crawl rather than walk, so your legs will become useless. It will begin to feel like pedaling a bicycle with flat tires; wobbly wheels. The massagers in our beauty products section do restore sensation, however.

5. **The Soul:** Ultimately, the Luna Disease corrupts you spiritually. Humanity resides in every one of us. No matter how ugly we are to one another, and it’s the last thing to go. But I’ve found solace in prayer. 

\*\*\*

Behind me, I heard the drone of mothmen. They found me –– they always do. I took Dr. Ricks’ note and ran. 

I’ll never stop running until I transform. But if there’s one silver lining to be found, at least I’ll have a treatment plan, as outlined by the good doctor."

He’s senseless, peaceful. It hurts now, of course, but he’ll be forgotten in 90 years time, a vague folded photograph of a single suffocated life. I won’t forget him though. I’ll rock him back and forth ‘till he disintegrates to the Earth again. 

I’ve always been a drifter, I’ve never settled anywhere. A perpetual, seasonal nomad. The world that you know is a beautiful place, churning out new colours and slowly decomposing in time and space, but I’ll never call a single country home. That’s not how it’s meant to be for me. 

But I am well-known. 

I was once the people's emperor, their special friend, the ancestor, a child, but those people are are dwindling now. New people,  hateful people, treat me like garbage.

I always thought that my worst nightmare would be to burn alive or be trapped in a room that is slowly filling up with water. But one fateful night, I have learned that there's something much worse.

It started in my dreams. One night as I was sleeping, I noticed that something was out of the ordinary. I was asleep and dreaming, but somehow, I still understood that something didn't feel right. Someone was there that did not belong in my dreams. But I couldn't see what it was just yet.

Every night I fell asleep, the feeling grew stronger. I have been waking up in fear for weeks now. My dreams are not scary, but something in them is sinister. Then, one night I saw him. In a far distance, there he stood. I couldn't yet see him well, but I knew it was a man. From then, wherever I look I can see his silhouette in the distance. My fear grew stronger every single night. 

Every time I'd sleep, he would get closer and closer. It seemed that he was studying me in my sleep, gathering information, manipulating my dreams to see what scares me the most. And then, he found it. The one thing that is worse than dying in pain.

There he was. I can see him well, he is close. The night I experienced my worst nightmare. He studied me, and he studied me well. I could see his face. He wasn't deformed or scary looking, he had a human face. Almost human. He carried a sinister grin and his eyes looked dead. Soulless. 

Anywhere I looked, he was always there. But he was smart, he didn't just stand close. No, he was there to bring terror. 
If in the room a door was slightly cracked open, he would be looking at me through that crack. 

If I was lying in bed, he would be looking at me from the foot of the bed, only showing his head. 

If I looked up, he was on the ceiling, right in the corner. 

If I looked out the window, he was standing outside looking right at me. 

If I was looking at a window with a reflection or a mirror, he was always behind me. Grinning.

If I suddenly turn my head, his face was right next to mine. 

If I turn to look at someone, he was right next to them. Staring at me.

Imagine the scariest place you could look and see a face. He was there. 
Now, every night I see him in my dreams, I am scared to open my eyes when I wake up. The fear I experience just before opening my eyes is worse than you could ever imagine. What if he is right there, looking at me?"

When Cute Boy (that’s not his real name I think) arrived on my doorstep, I had a hard time processing things. Firstly, even though I’d secretly wanted a child for years, I hadn’t really specified the age. So when a sevenish year old boy appeared on my porch, I kinda just went with it? A kid is a kid I guess?

Secondly, he didn’t really seem to mind the witch-nipple-freezing-cold at all. Dressed lightly - that is to say not dressed at all - he stood there perfectly still, staring at me with those face-swallowing eyes of endless vantablack, smiling crookedly in the most adorable way inconceivable, teeth going every which way for miles and miles and miles.

“Miles?” I asked. Why I asked such a thing, I’ll never know.

“Have you seen Uncle Clyde?” Cute Boy whispered.

Short story even shorter, I hadn’t, so I invited him in, as is a motherly thing to do? I’ve never really been a mom before per se, so I mostly mimicked the feelings Cute Boy invoked in me.

“Just ignore the needles,” I suggested as I sat him down on the couch. “I use them for party tricks.”

Cute Boy nodded, his unflinching grin showing more teeth than was strictly necessary. And those gums! I’ve never seen gums so gummy. Like dead worms tightly interwoven to form a warty flesh conglomeration.

“Have you seen Dad?” he asked.

“Can’t say that I have,” I said. “What does he look like?”

“Like an eye,” Cute Boy mumbled. “Like a big old eye.”

“That’s, uh, something,” I noted philosophically. 

“Are you my new mommy now?”

“Err,” I shrugged. “What, uh, what happened to the old one?”

“Uncle Clyde took her,” Cute Boy murmured, his bulging eyes swelling to improper proportions. “He liked her arms and legs.”

“Uh, I bet,” I nodded continuously. “Arms. Legs too.”

Cute Boy told me all about his family in the crooked house up by the upside-down-grin moon, and how he’d wandered off rather upset after Uncle Clyde forced leeches under his eyelids. It was a nice, cathartic talk.

But I digress.

Cute Boy fell asleep on my couch, but he woke up screaming every so often, which, as a mother, deeply concerned me.

“What’s with the howling?” I finally asked.

“Gotta relieve the pressure,” Cute Boy said.

And then he grabbed one of the needles, you know, the ones I use for party tricks? 

***POP?!***

That’s my question. Is it normal for an eye to go ***POP?!*** when you jab it with a needle? And is it normal for the eye to deflate like a flat tire, only to slowly expand again?

It might be a stupid question, but like I said I’m really new to this mom thing, so please go easy on me.

Screams and wet sickening crunches filled his ears as he flew down the endless hall. Row after row of open doors swished past in his peripheral vision, glimpsing only the briefest splashes of red and shining silver. The murky darkness ahead of him dissipated as he grew closer, yet never fully gave way to anything, only more doors, more darkness, more screams. And yet still he ran, on and on. Stopping wasn't an option. The only sound more clear to him than the screams, and the blood roaring in his ears, was the steady, ceaseless thumping of heavy footsteps behind him. He didn’t know how close they were and he didn’t dare look back lest he stumble, but no matter how fast he ran they never dissipated, beating in some twisted rhythm with his heart. He felt his breath clawing at his throat, the burning sensation slowly creeping down into his chest. He couldn’t keep doing this, not forever, and yet the hallway stretched on. He wanted to scream and fight but his body wouldn’t let him, knowing instinctively there was no fighting this, the only option was running.

The slightest change in the inky blackness ahead focused his attention. *Was that a door*? With renewed determination he pushed himself, his whole body alight with pain, breath rasping, legs pounding the floor, on toward the shape in the darkness. Hope surged in his chest as his hopes were realised.

A loud bang echoed down the hall as he burst through, but the hope only moments ago pushing him onwards turned to creeping, sickening fear. Ahead there was...nothing, an endless abyss stretching in all directions, with the floor in front of him suddenly dropping away. He turned frantically looking for anything, a ledge, another door, anything.

Nothing was there. Only him, the abyss, and the heavy, thumping footsteps.

He turned back for the first time, and into the cloying darkness behind him he stared, transfixed as a figure lumbered into view, the dim light reflecting off their thick metal boots. Clad in filthy brown rags and their face shrouded by a burlap hood the light reflected off of one other feature - the cold dirty steel of their machete.

He turned again, frantically back and forth between the figure and the abyss, struck with an overwhelming sense of dread and powerlessness, desperate for a solution to present itself. Nothing came. Powered on by pure instinct, he took the only option available, and launched himself out into the empty blackness. 

Looking back as he fell, he saw the figure watching him plummet, and as they receded from view he looked down, only to see the ground rushing up to meet him. 

He awoke, sore, bruised and most likely broken, but alive. As he groggily looked around and heaved himself upwards, he felt dread grip his heart. Sinking back down to his knees in despair he saw before him an endless hallway, and behind him the thump, thump, thump of heavy footsteps approaching."
kl4emy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kl4emy/i_feel_lonely_around_people_and_i_like_being/,I feel lonely around people and I like being lonely,0,3,1609078814.0,"People make me feel lonely and I like feeling lonely. I love being alone and I guess I am one of those people really and it was just the way I was born. My mother tried to make me more sociable but she failed in the end as I am a lonely person to the bone. I can only feel lonely when people are around me and I guess if people make me feel lonely its kind of ironic right. Whenever I am in a crowd of people I just start to feel lonely and I don’t talk to anyone and from their point of view I am just ignoring them or being straight up weird.  

As you can guess I don’t have any friends or any kind of relatives I can rely on anymore. I have to resort to abducting people and locking them down in my cellar, so that I can feel lonely. With each person though there is a limit to how much loneliness I can feel and so I have to abduct another person. I have been doing this for many years now and I guess as the number of people down in my cellar increased, death balanced the numbers. I would either have to kill some or they had some underlining health condition which killed them.  

Recently though I have been extra busy with abducting people and putting them down in my cellar. I had about ten people locked in my cellar and they were all tied up to a wall by use of a chain. Oh the loneliness that I felt was amazing and no matter how they cried out to me, to let them escape, I couldn’t really hear them as I was in my own world.  

I then had to increase space by doing up my attic and locking people up there so that I could feel lonely. I wish that I could feel lonely by just sitting in my own room or something similar, but I cannot. There are the odd times where I feel the need to be less lonely and I just go to some secluded park and then suddenly, I start to feel claustrophobic like I am being squashed against a wall or something. The noise of being in a secluded park with no one around is harrowing but then I go back to my cellar or attic to feel lonely again. This is how I survive.   "

You reached to the staircase, ascending quickly, only to find the door heavy, barely budging. You pushed it open, after some time, and a red velvet chair fell over, as it had been blocking the door. The first sign of human life, which was... well, whether was it a relief or not was still unbeknownst to you. 

You pushed the door open the rest of the way, to a room with a green carpet. Peering through the window, you saw only black. You moved downstairs, and went to the hall to the left of the TV, which led to the eerily desolate bedroom. The door next to the bed was locked, and you spent no time trying to open it, as it didn’t budge whatsoever, unlike it’s unlocked colleague. 

You moved to the living room again, the one you had awakened in, and jostled the knob on the TV, and to your surprise, it made an electric click. You heard the same noise, however faintly, from upstairs. You went back in the room with the green carpet, and, amazingly, when you looked out the window, you saw into the living room, seemingly through the screen of the TV. 

Though, it was hazy, swishing with the occasional static, and you couldn’t make out any finer details, it was definitely the living room. You’d walk downstairs, and the TV would be off. You tried changing the channel, and going upstairs, and you saw a different, Unfamiliar room with chairs stacks randomly atop each other. You went back down, switched the channel again, and it turned back to black. You went upstairs, going to the window again, as you looked at something through the window that wasn’t there before. 

It sat in the chair in a docile state, as though it were mocking you for your unaware sleep some time prior. You couldn’t see through the static now, but it seemed it was moving, raising its arms. The feed of the screen cut for only a moment, and when it returned, it was standing straight up, and seemed like it turned to the staircase. 

You wasted no time. You rushed to the door, pushing it shut, and slamming the chair against it with a thud. You heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and, desperately, you jumped through the screen of the window, falling into static. 

As the door knocked open, and the chair fell over, you saw yourself walking in, just as you had, looking inquisitively around the room, unaware of your presence behind the static screen.

Then, you looked around, knowing faces, scarred with tears.

There were hundreds of them, of you.

One morning I got a spontaneous call from my dad; he said that he and my mom need a break from their everyday and wanted me to house-sit the farm, I agreed because I like the countryside and would be happy to spend some time outside of my dorm. Few days later I packed my things and drove the nine hours down. When I arrived, the keys were in the post box and my parents we gone, as if in a hurry. They hadn’t even closed the main gate properly.

I didn’t think much of it and made myself at home in my old room, invited a few friends and had a nice evening. I thought everyone had left, so I started clearing the kitchen, but then Jack came in. He startled me but ended up helping, during which we chatted. He asked how my parents were, and that they had been acting strange in the weeks leading up to their impromptu vacation. I said I hadn’t noticed and that they were probably just stressed. Jack seemed to be a little skeptical, so I asked why he thought so. He said that the daughter of the previous owner had returned a month or so before and caught everyone off guard. 

He told me how thirty years ago her father had shot his wife and hanged himself in the barn, that the poor girl found both and couldn’t cope so she left to a facility- one she paid for with the money my parents gave her for the farm. I was shocked, I had never known. 

I had quite fond memories of the barn because I often found myself there when I needed some peace, unknowingly a place where true horror found a home. I knew the barn like the back of my hand. 

One evening I could not sleep and had the urge to go inside, and while sitting on one of the hidden beams reading my book, I heard footsteps and when I looked down, I saw a woman, the daughter. 

I had never seen her before, but I just knew who she was. She stood still and did not look up, after a moment she turned back around and left. Curious I climbed down and followed her, but when I left the barn she was gone. I was freaked out so went to get my book, wanting to go back home. 

I went back inside the barn and in the place where I had left my book was a small red shoe, then my flashlight flickered once and when it came back on, I looked up and saw the daughter hanging on the beam I was sitting on minutes before. I wanted to scream and run but I froze. 

In that moment I felt the cold and soft hands from a forgotten dream slipping around my head and shoulders, caressing almost, and slowly the tightening of the rope as I lost consciousness."

Between indistinct murmurs you can make out the words, “Little rabbit, will you come to me?”. The words are irresistible almost as if they were dipped in honey. In your mind this is not a question. So you find yourself pulled towards the chanting. Such a pleasant voice. 

“Come here little rabbit.”  

The voice never leaves you as you struggle against the river’s current, push through the brambles and stumble between densely packed trees. Emerging from the forest, there you stand, cold, wet and clothes tattered. Before you sits a cabin silhouetted against dusk’s light. The sun seems to fight desperately to stay above the horizon for fear of what the night may bring. The sunlight stabs horizontally between the swaying trees causing shadows to edge toward you in a menacingly discorded dance. You catch movements in the very edges of your vision and feel a tingling sensation in your fingertips. The hair raises on the back of your neck as you find yourself looking through a window to see a figure clothed in darkness. 

The figure seems to be hunched over and rocking back and forth. Have you been seen? It’s hard to tell if the figure is facing you or away from you. Everything in your being tells you to turn around and run back the way you came as fast as you can. Yet, you cannot. You stand there transfixed by the vision before you. The figure continues to rock back and forth. Back and forth. The sun slowly sinks below the horizon extinguishing the last rays of light. You realize that you can no longer see the figure through the window, but you can feel its presence. It's seething with hunger and malice. You now know that the figure was facing your direction.

It has been days and he is still watching my every move. Here I am, a married woman in my late 30's with a stalker. And to make matters worse, he's my husband's brother who is living in the house across the street.

How did my husband react? Ha, don't make me laugh. He doesn't give a single fuck and thinks I am crazy. Oh, I wish I don't love this lazy bastard, lying on the couch with a bottle of beer and box of pizza in front of the TV for hours on end. I couldn't bear the smell - it has been days and I know I have to freshen up that living room. I had to literally drag him out of that goddamn couch into his hobby room in the basement tonight. He didn't say anything but I am sure he cursed me in his mind. Whatever, I still need to clean and make dinner for the both of us. Fucking lazy cunt. Fucking useless cheater.

And now I notice his creepy brother walking towards our house. I cannot have a rest, can I? Last night, he called our house and I told him my husband is away for the weekend so that he wouldn't invite himself over. Maybe that's a bad idea, it clearly didn't work. Maybe he thinks I am alone in the house now. I'll grab my husband's gun in the drawer just in case...


HIS:

It has been three days. I am watching her every move. You might call me obsessed but I need to know where my brother is. The last time I saw him, his last words were ""she found out about my affair, she's going to kill me"". I never thought of it literally but after three days without a sight of him, I am worried. I don't believe what she said on the phone last night too. And I would call 911 but it sounds ridiculous in my head. So now, I am on my way to their house, hoping all of this is in my head, but I'm carrying my pocket knife just in case..."

In a more dramatic retelling of one’s adult interaction with their childhood bully, the next line would be something like “I don’t know how he found me.” 

But I knew exactly how he’d done it. He had googled me. There aren’t exactly a lot of guys named Ricardo Hippolythe in rural Kentucky. Plus, I’m somewhat of a local celebrity.

The first word he spoke was my first name, and I recognized the voice immediately. He had said a version of it many times during our school days. 

Re-tardo Hippopotamus.

Succinct. Effective. Infuriating. 

Name-calling was the least of what he did to me.

However, in the years since his reign of terror ended, I’ve grown tremendously.

Physically, mentally, and spiritually I’m a different man. He was no longer a threat.

“Ricardo. I owe you a HUGE apology. I should have made this call years ago…and please believe me, I wanted to do it. I’ve just been too embarrassed to even speak with you after everything I put you through. I always thought I was just being funny, but after we got out of school I realized what a dick I had been.

I’m not asking for your forgiveness—I don’t deserve that. But I’ve seen you doing your paranormal stuff on TV, and I need your help.”

I cleared my throat.

“Kaden, while I did hate you for many years, I don’t anymore and I DO forgive you. What can I do for you?”

Kaden let out a dramatic whoosh of air, followed by “Thank you, Ricardo.

“It’s my son. He’s nine years old and something is tormenting him at night. It’s getting really, really bad. He’s seeing things, screaming uncontrollably, and a few nights ago I woke up to the sound of chanting in some foreign language and he was standing by my bed with a kitchen knife.  

“He can’t sleep, he barely eats, and he’s so scared and miserable that he rarely leaves his bedroom anymore. Ricardo, that kid means everything to me. He’s the reason I became a better person.”

With confidence, I spoke.

“Kaden…do you remember Aaron Evans?”

Quietly.

“Yeah. The kid that accidentally stepped in front of a train, right?”

Calmly.

“Kaden, no one ACCIDENTALLY steps in front of a train. It was suicide. You pushed him too far.”

Silence.

“Did you know my mother is from Haiti? She has taught me MANY things, and Vodou is SO powerful, Kaden.

“As I said before I do forgive you, but when I found Aaron's spirit in the darkness he asked me for a favor. He had been my best friend, so I couldn’t deny his wish.

“And so tonight, just as I have every night for the past month, I will say the words. I will say those words and Aaron will step into your son again, and he will rain hell upon all of you.

“And I sincerely hope you don’t live near railroad tracks.”"

Then, for my sake, count yourself lucky for having the same gift deep in the animalistic recesses of your brain. 

  I was alone in my house a few weeks ago, quietly reading a book. The steady ticking of the analogue clock in the kitchen and the howling of the year's first snowstorm just outside were the only noises to be heard. 
 
   Then it came to me. A spontaneous thought came ringing through the silence. ""You haven't locked the door."" I live in a small town. I hardly even bother with the thing, that is, until nightfall. Something in me just won't let me go to sleep until I lock the deadbolt. 
So I placed my book on the nightstand, put on my slippers and made my way to the door. With one hard turn my castle was secure. The thought would make sleep come easy. But first, another chapter. 

  Just as the words on the page were about to take my full attention, the book went flying out of my hand and my heart skipped a beat. From the other room, I could hear the door handle being turned aggressively from one side to the other over and over again! After that came a thunderous banging at the door! Then, just as quickly as it started, the silence returned. 

  I sat there completely paralyzed for a few moments. 
If it weren't for that single random thought I'd be a dead man. No matter how far we step from the edges of the jungle, there will always be a small part of our minds to remind mankind that it's where we came from. Do what I did and listen to your gut instincts. Don't do what my poor neighbor did, as I came to learn from the police the next morning, and ignore it..."

Suzy’s parents went to bed hours earlier absolutely fuckin hammered. Suzy lay wait in her bed staring at the ceiling, unwilling to try and fall asleep. This was the night she was going to meet Santa. The star lit roof of her bedroom seemed more entertaining than usual as she kept her ears wide. One of the nights where you check the time again after twenty minutes and its been two. The house usually creeked at night, but when there was an usual creek she’d sneak to the end of the hall and catch an eye of the tree. Nothing so far. ‘I’ll ask him why everyone says to leave out milk with the cookies when my parents say he likes beer.’ Suzy though to herself. ‘I’ll ask him to bring Rudolph with him to the mall next year.’ ’If we don’t have a chimney ho-‘ Her thoughts were broken by a scuffle from the basement. She listened closer, thirty seconds of silence followed by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs and to the tree. She was full of excitement. ‘This is it,’ she thought to herself as she quietly pranced and grabbed her housecoat. Sneaking to the end of the hall she peaked her eyes around the corner and almost screamed when she saw him. There was Santa. She rubbed her eyes to be sure. Then something caught her off guard. He put a present into his sack. Then another. She leaned back in surprise and he put yet another present in his sack. 

“What are you doing?” heart pounding she asked in a faint voice, still only showing the top of her head. 

Santa slowly turned to face her and in a joly voice replied. “Delivering presents of course.”

“Why are you putting them in your sack?” She responds after a few seconds.

“Your presents were underneath. These toys are for your neighbors. Why are you up so late young girl?”

“I wanted to meet you,” she replies.

Santa subtly laughs and takes a step towards her as he say. “I’m happy to meet you sweetie. You’re gunna have a hell of a Christmas. Now go back to bed I got a lot of stops tonight.” 

She complies and gives him a smile before skipping to her room.

Laying in bed she felt happy. She could fall asleep complete, which even with the rush of adrenaline didn’t take long. When she woke she jumped outta bed so fast she barely landed on her feet. Grabbing her housecoat without even putting it on she ran out to the tree. She was paralyzed when she saw it. ‘Where are all the presents?’ Staring for a minute she grew cold. The living room felt colder than normal, like an end of summer night. Her mind in complete confusion she stumbled backwards to her parents bedroom and started pounding on the door."

That was why Father kept her in the attic, away from us children. Every morning and every evening, he took up a bowl of stew. We could hear his footsteps on the floor above, but nothing else.

We’d been instructed to never venture into the attic for our own safety, but of course, one day the curiosity became too much.

We decided only one of us should go. That way, if we were discovered, only one would get in trouble.

I was the youngest.

My flashlight hardly cut through the darkness. But the pitch blackness wasn’t nearly as terrible as the smell. I coughed and fought the urge to spit, the scent of decay so strong I could taste it. I pulled my shirt over my nose and kept walking.

The floor was coated in dust, the particles swirling around me. The attic seemed much larger than it should, but perhaps that just my fear.

Eventually, my flashlight caught something. I thought it was a doll at first—it hung unmoving in the air, limbs akimbo. As I pushed forward, I realized it was a naked woman. She was chained to the far wall, her body hanging against the chains in defeat.

I froze. This was wrong. Being so young, without the knowledge of what preys in the dark, of what monsters hide in plain sight, I didn’t understand exactly what I was seeing, but I knew with every fiber of my being that it was wrong.

The woman stirred. She raised her head, blinking against the light.

“Ezra?” she said.

I was too frightened to speak.

She studied me, her eyes adjusting. Then, they widened. “Angela?”

It shouldn’t be strange for this woman to know my name. After all, she was my mother. But it felt like being called by a stranger, and I hesitated.

“It’s okay, baby,” she said. Tears streamed down her face and her voice wavered. “It’s me, Mommy. God, you were so small the last time I saw you! I’ve missed you.”

My vision blurred and I realized I was crying. Mommy. I’d never said the word before.

“Mommy?” I asked, my voice hardly above a whisper.

She nodded, smiling through her tears. “Yes! I’m your mommy!” She tugged at the chains. “I can’t move, sweetheart. Can you come to me?”

I nodded and rushed forward. At last, I’d have what all the other kids had—a real mother, one I could see and hug. Forgetting my earlier fear, I ran and threw my arms around her.

“Thank you.” To my surprise, arms wrapped around me as well. I tried to pull away, but the limbs held me fast. “No need to struggle, little one,” said a voice in my ear, now echoing and inhuman. “Mommy is *soooo* hungry.”

Pincers pierced my throat, hot blood spilling down my front. The last thing I saw was a woman with eight eyes opening her mouth wide to finish her meal."

The very simplicity of the onset of madness is part of what makes it so utterly terrifying. That and the gradually increasing loss of control over one's thoughts.

But there's an almost anticlimactic absurdity to the images that invade one's mind.

I'm an ordinary man with a bad back and a stressful job. So far, I've lived uneventfully.

Until the dreams came. And they stayed. And then they got worse.

And eventually they spilled out into my waking life.

It's been a long day. I slept poorly (as usual), and work was an ordeal (ditto). Walking into the pub and finding my favorite table unoccupied was a small victory that I savored just as much as I was hoping to savor this beer.

Instead, my eyes are swelling with tears because I just saw a pig walk on its hind legs out of the hallway that leads to the restrooms. It's shuffling around the barroom, doing a queer sort of dance and tearing pieces off its own body, which it then throws onto people's tables.

I can see it as well as I can see my own trembling hands cupping the pint glass in front of me. Hell, I can even smell it. It smells like smoke and blood and old candles. 

But only I see it. And I cannot escape. Because I know it will be waiting anywhere I go. And I really mean anywhere."

In a state forest I can’t tell you about, there is a large, white door. If you walk through this door, you’ll enter a weird, extradimensional portion of those same woods. Our testing indicates that if you wander out of sight from the door, it will disappear, and you will not be able to find a way out. 


We found out about it when a group of college kids went missing, one of them found days later alone and babbling in the woods. He was a suspect in his friend's disappearances, but we helped get him cleared when we brought him in for questioning. 


He claimed that when you walk through the door, you feel dizzy, as if you’ve been drinking. The sun never moves, it is constantly dusk in there, no matter how long you hike. After a while, you begin to hear voices and see hallucinations, calling out for you to come home. 


He also claimed that, after waiting by the door for his friends, one came rushing back, covered in blood, screaming they had to run. The other friend passed out of shock once they returned, and was left behind. We have not yet found him.


We sent a team in to explore, naturally, but none of them came back. We recorded their time in the door, discovering that they were hunted by what we call “The Unblessed”, giant, naked humanoids creatures with the skull of a deer for a head. Once they hunt you down, they appear to terrorize and torture people, for what we assume is nutricinal value, as the creatures do not appear to be able to eat. 


We tried destroying the door. It’s resistant to fire, anyone who tries to shoot it will shoot themselves instead, cannot be destroyed by axes or blunt objects. 


Believe me, if you can think of it, we’ve tried it. 


At first we were relieved when it vanished. But we soon discovered it simply moved to another area of the park, so we had to move our restriction zone to keep civilians from entering. 


We got another report last week, another door was spotted, but this time, it was in a different park, states away. We set up a second restriction zone at that park, after confirming the second door had similar properties to the first.


I came to my shift yesterday, and noticed the door was cracked open. I glimpsed inside, and saw one of those Unblessed creatures, scratching at their side of the door with uncut human nails, giggling hysterically. 


We don’t know what these things are, or what they want, if they made the doors or are just taking advantage of them.


Stay away from weird doors in the woods.

The last words my mother told me were, ""Daniel, eat your salad.""

My family wasted over an hour of my Saturday looking at fresh vegetables at the local farmers market. My parents and younger sister were moved to veganism by a disturbing documentary about the life of cows before they became those delicious greasy fast food burgers I had always enjoyed. I was the only one wanting to hang on to my carnivore lifestyle. I was outnumbered and being too young to have any say in most aspects of my life I just had to go with it, which I did very begrudgingly.

We live in a city that has one of the largest prisons in the country. The prison has many extensive work programs but one of the most well known is the prison garden which supplies the local groceries and farmers markets with organic goods at extremely low prices.

That day my family loaded up on the cheap produce and bragged about how sustainable our veganism would be for a family of 4 on a budget. Yuck! is all I could think. I was dreading dinner, and when I got home I played one of my games to try to not have to think about what I had coming. All that did was speed up time and before I knew it I was sitting at our dinner table with a wooden salad bowl in front of me.

I watched my family dig in, They took large bites of lettuce, peppers, onion, and red radishes. I held off as long as I could till I heard my mom say, ""Daniel, eat your salad."" I wanted to argue, but I didn't get the time to. My sister spoke in a quiet voice. ""I don't feel good."" She then vomited into her salad bowl and fell to the floor. My mother ran to her side and before she could check on my sister I heard my father yell ""Get off of my daughter you monster!"" I watched him jump onto my mother and stab her over and over with the large wooden salad fork.

I spent the rest of the night hiding up stairs in my closet under a mess of toys and clothes. I could hear my father yelling like a demon had taken him over and I feel thankful every day he never came to look for me.

It took a long time for the city to figure out exactly why over 200 people went crazy all in the same weekend. In the end it came down to their diets and the fact that the newest batch of prison grown vegetables had been spiked with a cocktail of many different hallucinogenic drugs. The prisoners had gotten fed up with being used for cheap labor and took it out in the worst way imaginable.

I now live with my aunt and I always refuse to eat my vegetables."

He pulled back a dirty sheet and he let me into his hut. It was full of smoke, and I could not see at first. There was a stove in the middle and rags around. There were animals hanging on one wall. Some dead, some dried out, a few still alive struggling weakly.

He pointed at the blanket beside the stove. “Sit.” I sat. I was so hungry because mama hadn’t been well. The flu hit our village hard and we were cut off as punishment. They said we are not clean, the way we eat, what we choose to eat. They said we make our people look bad. I don’t know how we do that. We are never seen. They said we can’t sell grain or pigs this year.

I rubbed my hands together to make them warm. He put a ladle in the big bowl on the stove, steaming. “Eat,” he said, “Good.” I took the bowl. The bowl was warm. The broth smelled good. I could hardly wait for it to cool and I sucked it down so the top of my mouth was burned for three days.

He said, “Look,” and pulled a cage in from outside the hut. Puppies. Three white ones, one with a brown patch, for selling. The brown one was a runt. He took it out, held by its neck in front of me, pawing the air. “Sick,” he said and put it on my knee.

It’s eyes had not been open long, and it sniffed my fingers, licking where there was soup. I liked it. It’s neck was warm and its little paws were soft.

“Keep,” he said. I told him I couldn’t trade for it, but he said it was useless to him, no good for selling. I started worrying why he brought me to his hut. He had given me food, and now this. Did he want something in return? I said I should go, mama would be worried.

He made a grunting noise. No-one ever talks to the old man. We both knew it was wrong for me to stay too long. I thanked him. I like the old man. He showed me how to wrap the puppy in a rag so it was easier to carry back to the village.

The puppy died. I had it play for a couple days with other puppies in the village, but it died anyway.

When the other puppies died and some of the older dogs died too, I pretended I didn’t know why. We had to sell them for meat behind the market. That's bad for us. It’s little money and dangerous because we will be punished again if they find out. We ate the meat and it did not make us sick. It’s good meat. It only made the dogs sick."

His parents never knew what was wrong with him. They always thought he was just a hungry kid. 

Numerous doctor visits failed to find a cure for his solution. His parents eventually surrendered to his needs and bought the boy all the food he craved. But no matter what they did, it never seemed to be the fix for the problem at hand. 

But, peace soon did return to the home. The boy was older now, shuffling through the hoops of adolescence and oddly calm compared to his peers. Everyone who knew him from when he was young chalked it up to him burning through all his chaotic energy when he was young. People around him even noted his intelligence.

He was not immune to the usual cravings though that came with a growth spurt. People had always been suspicious of his eating habits given his past actions, so he mastered the skill of hiding his snacking. They weren’t big bites of sustenance, yet it was enough to carry him over until his next true meal. 

Precise planning was a must to maintain control over hunger. A few years had passed and life remained calm. Unlike most kids his age, his favourite spot was the main library located in the downtown of the city. 

At the end of each week, he would travel down there on the reasoning of needing a quiet place to complete homework. 

Homework was the last thing on his list when he was at the library. 

University students were the ones he was the most interested in. With his smarts, it was easy to keep a list of who was taking what major. Picking out his target for the day was then just a matter of mood. 

Striking up a conversation with these exhausted students was a simple task. Charm was part of his arsenal. From there he would move in and lead the victim away from the work at hand. Glory would then befall upon the boy. He would feast, snack, and steal the ideas and thoughts of his victim. The knowledge he absorbed was the closest thing to a drug, and it was completely legal. No law of any sort said that eating the ideas of people was a punishable offense. He reveled in his weekly feedings. 

Hunger satisfied, he would head home and greet his parents. They used to be lively folks, always running about and trying to ensure the best life for their child. Now all they do is slouch in the recliners in front of the television, brains riddled with holes from the cravings of the boy. He never liked to see them like this. However, access to food is a human right."

Well, almost everything. The one thing my mother always denied was acupuncture.

""Those needles will be too sharp for you!"" she claimed.

""Just stay here, I will make you a soup, dear."" was one of her favourite lines when I was feeling more like myself again. She even tried replacing my mattress. No good, though.

But when my mother died, I decided to stay the night in my old room. As I was walking up the stairs, I tripped over Mom's old rug. I lifted it up to brush off all the dust, and I saw a tiny rung on the floor.

As I lifted it and headed down, I was terrified. I saw tiny canisters on the roof of the secret room, all labled with a single black 'X'. As I followed them all, I noticed that some were in the direction of my room. I went back up the stairs to my room.

I lifted up my mattress. The reason I was always sick was splayed out and underneath my mattress. It was hundreds and hundreds of needles."

It was a big production with all the works. Marching bands, floats, fan-favorite characters acting out little scenes for the kids. The parade would march down Main Street before turning left into the public library parking lot, where the parade ended.

The last year they held the parade was on December 24, 2002, when I was just eight years old.

I was standing right at the front by the curb with my best friend, Tami Lynn, both of us in matching Christmas hair bows. We were holding hands as the Stonehill High School Marching Band trooped proudly past, dancing to the rhythm of a jazzy Jingle Bells. We cheered for Charlie Brown as he tried to kick the football, only to laugh when Lucy pulled it from under him. We waved at the firetruck that drove by and tossed us candy and popcorn balls.

But the pièce de résistance, as in every year, was Santa Claus. And that year they got a good one.

Santa would march toward the back of the parade—so they could build up anticipation, of course—accompanied by three or four elves who would hand out candy and treat bags. Santa himself carried a big red bag and would toss out a few little presents to lucky kids in the crowd.

But that year, Santa did something a little different.

As he marched down the street with his troupe of elves, he walked up to children in the crowd, took them by the hand and led them to join him in the parade.

It was wonderful. It was brilliant. The kids marched down the street with him, laughing and cheering and clinging to his bright red suit.

And then he was walking up to *us.*

I looked up at the twinkle in his jolly green eyes, at his apple red cheeks, held out my hand…

And he walked right past me and picked Tami Lynn instead.

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was *heartbroken.* I watched as Tami Lynn took Santa’s hand and scampered off. She didn’t even spare me a backwards glance. And then they were gone off down the street to the turn in the road.

Later, the parents would go to the library parking lot to collect their children. And they would discover, amidst the chaos of departing bands and cars and floats, that the children were nowhere to be found.

Later, Santa Claus—that is, the man who was *supposed* to be playing Santa in the parade—would be found dead in his home. He had been shot the night before.

Later, the whole town would tear itself apart looking for the children, but they wouldn’t find them. All they would discover was Tami Lynn’s matching Christmas hair bow, crushed and discarded in the dirty gray snow."

And then it beat.

Punching a hole through with it's legs, it kicked an earthquake out of the bauble, breaking an entrance through it.

When enough space was made, it plopped out onto the ground with the white stuff and blood plopping behind it.

“Because they’re for Santa. He will know if you’ve touched them in the night and will take your presents back.” The father replied, a slight edge to his voice as he looked out of the window. 

The news was on...something wasn’t quite right, but when she turned to get a better look, her father immediately turned it off. So, she admitted defeat, and scampered off to bed with some hushed goodnights to her father. 

She tossed and turned that night, full of excitement. Her dad had come in a few times to check her windows and doors, but she just assumed he was looking for Santa or avoiding a draft. She asked him one more time, just for good luck, if she could have one of Santa’s cookies. 

“I said no, Amelia. That’s final.” Dad looked worn out, like he hadn’t slept in days...the stress must really have gotten to him. She was taken aback by the snap, but accepted his answer. He softened slightly. 
“I promise, you’ll understand why soon...Santa’s cookies are special, and taking one would make him very unhappy. Now get to sleep, I’ll get you in the morning for presents.” 

Amelia eventually found sleep, but woke suddenly a few hours later to hear sirens outside, and someone taking her dad away in handcuffs. A stranger in uniform came to find her, and sat down, her glasses slightly steamed from the temperature change. 

“Why is my daddy being taken away?” She asked, tears in her eyes. The police officer sighed, and then looked at her. 

“That man..was not your father. He’s your fathers twin, and he’d started to impersonate him. He then took your real father somewhere and left him there to die. With your mother dead, it was easier to do. However, there was a news report last night, explaining how he’d been found, nursed back to health, and was going to visit his daughter and surprise her in a Santa suit, going the full nine yards; drinking milk, eating cookies, et cetera. Clearly your uncle didn’t want that to happen.” 

Amelia felt sick, and horrified about what she heard. 
“W-what do you mean?”

The story I'm about to tell you is not a fairy tale or a joke. It's a story about real events that happened, and how I witnessed the untimely death of Rudolph the red-nosed Reindeer. Although this story may seem far-fetched, you might be surprised at the extent of things that can go wrong in one night. So buckle up, it's going to get bumpy.

It was Christmas Eve in 1969, in a little town in the north of Copenhagen. The streets were covered with snow and the stars were shining bright in the sky. I decided this year to stay up and wait to see if I could catch Santa bring me my gifts.

I was almost dozing off when I spotted a bright light in the sky, It was Santa in his sleigh being pulled by his reindeer's. I was so excited and started jumping up and down by my window sill. Santa started to set down, rapidly descending when I noticed that he seemed to have lost control of his sleigh. The lead reindeer with an extremely bright red nose was fighting against his straps and kept pulling away, running directly into the busy road opposite my house.

Suddenly bright headlights shone upon them and a heavy truck came out of nowhere and ran them over.

I screamed!!!

I ran out of the house to see clearly, the macabre sight of gore and blood, mashed reindeer flesh, splattered across the road. Santa was missing half his head and 8 of the reindeer's looked certainly dead. I could only see a sign of life from the lead reindeer, he was missing his rear legs, his red nose kept twitching and flashing like the warning lights of an ambulance. He kept making a squeaky noise like he was struggling to speak.

I moved closer and bent close to listen,

""Is he dead?"" he asked.

I looked back at Santa and replied ""He certainly is"".

My name is not Rudolph, it never was. I always told him not to call me that but he never listened.

He paused and coughed up lots of blood.

See, my real name is ""Ruddy"" and I am a girl.

I always hated being misgendered and being called a name that wasn't mine all my life. I am so glad that bastard Nicholas is dead.

She then lay down her head and died.

It suddenly dawned on me that what I just witnessed wasn't an accident and I wasn't getting any presents that christmas."

“Her thoughts went blank because her head was shot away like JFK. It was a loud, hard death, the sound of skull bone crumbling, the scraping away of cerebral matter as if it was shaved off. Not all her brain, but just enough. 

“Now, because she shot herself, she got transported to Hell. The process of depositing a soul in Hell is a very long and bureaucratic process, so it’s best to skip to the part with the fire and brimstone and horny fiends poking with pronged sticks and dicks – Oh, you’d hate to be penetrated by those fiends, they’d pull a whole lot of you out!

“They got her and first thing they did was give her Indian burns, until her skin snapped and rolled loosely around her forearms like a roll of toilet paper. Then they turned her limbs the wrong way like a toddler does with their dolls, turns the head around, makes the arms and legs face backwards. One fiend hooked his tail around her ankles and dragged her over abrasive stones like rough tongues that licked away dermis, and through fires twisting so crazily you’d think they were souls themselves.

“She’d regenerate after every torture, because Hell is just that way. And the fiends kept thinking up ways to elicit a scream, but she never did, not even a whimper. As if she were a person of plastic rather than flesh. If the fiends didn’t know better, they might have been torturing a manikin. 

“That’s what she was, an unfeeling manikin with soft skin and eyes that didn’t look.  

““*This ain’t no fun*,” one of the fiends confessed.

“They left her alone, and to this day she wanders Hell unbothered.

“Now kids, why do you think she never screamed, as if she were just an unthinking shell?

“That’s right. It’s because she shot gaps through her mind, disrupted the networks. And I bet you never learned this, but when you die, your soul retains the shape it is in when it leaves your body. So, her soul went down there missing the cerebral matter necessary to process what was happening. An eternity of torment is bearable when you’re not aware of it, don’t you think children?”

The children nodded. 

“And you’re aware that because you wrecked my property,” he pointed to the hole in his window, “You’re all going to Hell no matter what.”

The children didn’t nod because the realization was stirring their heads enough.

The old man then told the children that if they didn’t want to feel all the hurt and fire that comes with Hell, that they needed to follow in the woman’s wise steps, and so the kids went home to their parent’s closet, grabbed the gun, and did just that.

The old man listened to the bangs and smiled, and the house smiled because it didn’t have to worry anymore about kids throwing their balls through its windows."

I am not allowed to say how we can see other people's dreams or what company I work for, and it may not sound scary just by watching other people's dreams, but there are some rules that we have to follow.

Rule 1. We can’t talk about the dreams that we saw outside of work

Rule 2. We can’t interfere with other people's dreams.

Rule 3. Any sightings of the “Dream man” will need to be automatically reported to corporate.

The dream man is an Entity that randomly spawns in dreams and it can take form as a large male with a black suit and a white tie. Any dreams that the “dream man” enter will always end up with one person dead. 

We don’t know how dangerous the dream man is but if are you seeing a familiar person in your dream or having a nightmare then my best advice is... Always making sure you are dreaming by blinking twice or pinching yourself to wake up.

But that won’t always work cause the dream man can manipulate anyone’s dream, and can appear at multiple dreams at once.

And in case you are wondering I am the only dream watcher, and it can be stressful sometimes but I have been seeing the dream man in my daughter dreams, and it kills me fearing that every time my daughter sleep she won't wake up, and not telling her about the dream man is much worse than it seems so I keep a special eye on my daughter dream even if that means she is dreaming about a boy or being bully at school for having family issue."

kk0a99,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kk0a99/peekaboo/,Peekaboo,17,0,1608908401.0,"I had heard of the film from an associate. He told me that it had previously only been screened at Europe’s most avant-garde arthouse cinemas. The reels were now in the storefront theatre before me. There was no marquee. “One for the next show,” I said at the box office. The man who gave me the ticket smiled. “Les Voyeuses” read the ticket. The guy working concessions was even friendlier. I told him that I was fine, but the showtime wasn’t printed on my ticket. “I’ll let the projectionist know that someone came,” he said.

“You’re gonna love it,” said the ticket taker with vicarious excitement.

The movie began when I sat down. It was in black and white and silent. In the first shot, the camera followed behind a woman. Only her skirt was visible. The cameraman slowly maneuvered the camera up her skirt, where her head was. Her lips moved, and then she laughed. Without sound, the laughter looked convulsive. The film cut to an intertitle. “Peekaboo, I see you!” The woman, who had been walking backwards on her hands, righted herself, and her skirt fell inside out and became a top. Her bottom was also wearing a skit, from which jutted two arms and a head of hair reaching the ground. The cameraman handed the camera to the woman, and when she turned it around on him, he had his back to her. She spun to give a full view of the park where they were, and everybody had their backs to her.

She walked to a fountain by which a straightedge, a compass, and chalk lay on the concrete ground. She began to draw circles with her bottom hands as her top hands held the camera, and the film occasionally cut to intertitles to give geometrical explanations, some of which were just equations. “This is terrible,” I thought. “I didn’t pay to watch conjoined twins do math.” I remembered then that I had paid with my credit card. I should have used cash.

Her explanations became more arcane as she continued, and the pattern of nesting circles more intricate. She began to call them eyes. When the diagram was complete, she stood and straddled the largest circle. She dropped the camera, and it fell through the circle. Before I knew what I was seeing under the bottom skirt, the film cut to an intertitle. “Peekaboo, I see you!”

The next scene was in the lobby of a movie theatre, this movie theatre. The staff wore their same smiles and blindfolds of raw wool. A thin stream of blood drained from each eye.

Who ever I walk past they straight away start to show me a piece of string which they stretch out using both their hands at a horizontal position. I guess they are really trying to emphasise the string. Even whoever I talk to, they talk to me back while showing me the string. 

Whenever I am on a bus everyone on that bus shows me the string. I didn't even pay the bus fair because the bus driver kept showing me the string. I guess he doesn't want the money. Sometimes people would say random things like ""because of you, your son got multiple presents this Christmas"" 

That's a strange thing to say and on every corner there is a car crash as well. I definitely don't earn enough to buy my son a single present never mind multiple presents. When I went home my wife started showing me a string while talking casually to me. 

My son though would do something a bit different. He would show me a string which he stretched out and then he would constantly say ""thank you for giving me multiple presents for Christmas this year"" over and over again. 

Then the string he is holding out to me would start moving on its own horizontally. I could then hear hospital noises and stressful talkings. I look back at my son who then tells me ""with you dying I get multiple Christmas presents. My first Christmas present is you dying, my second Christmas present is never having to listen to your verbal abuse ever again, my third Christmas present is never having to walk on eggshells around you anymore, my 4th Christmas present is never having to deal with you when you are drunk....."" My son kept going on in the back ground. 

My son is right though with me now dying he would never have to deal with my multiple problems, which in return is the best multiple Christmas presents he is ever going to get. I admit that I am a terrible father and a human being. I hope that can kind of redeem me. "

Something in the air makes those things come out.

Father never told me how he discovered these creatures, and my older brother, Vasily, rarely asks any questions. He's always been a quiet man.

Every year, father takes out the old bronze key and unlocks the chest boarded up under his bed. Today, he handed me the old Kalashnikov, and Vasily got the shotgun. I watched him load up his Mosin-Nagant with bullets as he counted them one by one.

We geared up in our fur coats and snow boots, and set off into the woods.

Not too deep into the snow-laden pine branches, we spotted a flash of red. It disappeared behind the bushes, but the unmistakable stench of rotten flesh lingered. Father signaled for us to round the corner with our guns raised.

It's been my third year on the hunt, and each time, my stomach turns at the sight of it.

It's in the shape of a man - a pot-bellied, towering old man with pale, knotted hair clinging to its head and face. It had a bulbous red nose, and deep, sunken eyes that were swallowed up by wrinkles upon wrinkles. Its mouth contorted in a grotesque mimicry of a jovial smile, with rows of jagged yellow teeth protruding from cracked lips. Dark red and brown rags strained around its misshapen body, with bits of what used to be white fur at the rim still dangling from the fabric.

""Ho. Ho. Ho."" It croaked.

Father raised his rifle and sent a blast straight into its head. The creature flew back and dropped dead with a line of spilt crimson leaking into the snow.

We heard scuttling in the trees all around us. Vasily steadied his shotgun and fired at a nearby branch. A pained howl accompanied by a dull thud and a flash of red, another one of the creatures dropped out of a tree.

I panicked when I heard the guttural breathing behind me, and whipped around to slam the muzzle right into its face. I yelped, letting out a burst of fire and watched the bullet tear into the thing. It screamed and lunged for cover behind the trees.

Before dusk, we could perhaps take out a dozen of these things, but there are more hidden deeper within the woods, father says.

We don't know where these things come from, or what even created them. We know that Santa can deliver gifts to the children of the world in one night, because there's never been just one Santa.

When each Santa finishes dropping off their package, they end up here. Then new ones will emerge with each Christmas. Their numbers have been growing as the number of children in the world grew. They lose their purpose, and wander the frozen forest in search of prey.

One day, they will overrun these woods."

Jamie stands there, not moving. 

“This is what mom and dad wanted, they wanted to be cremated.”

She acquiesces my decision, and moves to help.

“Good girl,” I whisper. “Mom and dad would be proud to see us helping them”.

She mumbles something indistinctly. 

“Come again?”

“I just, I have a bad feeling about this time,” she says rather sheepishly. 

I chuckle. 

“Nothing has gone wrong for the past few years, why would something go wrong now?”

We drag the corpse up into cremation room, and lay it upon the table. 

“Good job,” I pant. “Now is a good time for lunch”.

I reach into my pocket and take out a smushed egg sandwich. I grimace at the sight of the egg oozing out on the side. 

“You want this?”

Jamie nods vigorously, and I toss her the sandwich. She unwraps it, and devours the food like she’s never eaten before. 

“You ready?”

She nods with her mouth full.

I look around.

“Hey, hey, it’s alright. I’m here now.”

My memories had been reduced to fragments, replaying in slivers, one by one, as I tried to remember what happened last night and understand how I got here. 

First, I remembered darkness. A horn blared in the distance as we drove down some desolate one-lane road through cornfields. Clock read: 1:00 a.m.  Classic rock played on the radio – ZZ Top. The song, *Tush.* A car honked, then cruised past. The driver shouted. My eyes fought against the sleep my body begged for. Helen’s voice: “Stop it, Bradley.” I cranked up the radio. She turned it back down. A saxophone played from a jazz song, followed by the blues. Scrolled through more radio stations.

I remembered blinding white headlights from oncoming traffic. Another car breezed by, honking. Driver waved his fist, shouting. A semi-truck whooshed by, too close to my rearview mirror. Rain tapped on the windshield. Swirls of lights from cars’ taillights danced across my line of vision, blurring. Single lines on the street doubled as I nodded off at the wheel. “Wake up, Bradley!” Helen shouted. Scrolled through radio stations. AM and more AM talk shows. Static. Then silence. Helen’s voice again: “Don’t make me, Bradley.” Her eyes gazed up at me, disappointed. Her breath in my ear and her words: “I’m sorry.” The rain on the windshield turned to snow.

“I have to,” Helen said. “Don’t hate me.” The roar of the winter wind outside pounded against the windshield. Helen’s voice again: “Please, don’t…” The sound of the wind drowned out the rest. We pulled over. Helen slipped into the driver’s seat, trading places with me. We sat in the car by a barren field down some lonesome road.  Something silver glistened in Helen’s hands under the amber streetlights. A click sounded. Metal on metal. A shiny bullet. Another click. A bullet blasted. Snow fell. 

I remembered the field where she left me. And snow fell on me, burying me. 

White. Porcelain. Fleecy.  Snow. 

Stained red.

And I remember floating up. And my life replaying before me, just the way they always say it does when we die."

Timmy sprang from behind his snow fort with a perfectly built snowball in his hand. He took aim, threw, and…

Missed. 

Jack’s snowball flew true and smashed square into Timmy’s chest. 

“It’s not fair!” He cried.

Jack didn’t care. He made another. He threw it hard. It slammed into Timmy and knocked him to the ground. 

“Stop!”

Jack didn’t listen. He made another. He threw it hard. It was so well packed that it didn’t even break when it hit the child on the ground.

“Ow! Stop! That hurt!”

Jack didn’t care. He made another. He threw it hard. It collided with Timmy’s face, eliciting a scream.

When the snow cleared, he saw a jagged rock wedged in Timmy’s eye. 

Jack didn’t care. He picked up the shovel on the ground and began scooping snow onto the writhing, bloodied mess below him. Timmy screamed again. 

“STOP!! MOM!!! HELP!!!”

Jack didn’t care. He kept piling snow on top of his brother until the screams were so muffled that they were lost in the chirping of the winter birds. 

“JACK! WHAT DID YOU DO?!” His mother burst out of the front door, his father close behind. They tried to dig through the snow with their bare hands, the cold piercing to the bone. 

Jack didn’t care. He had a plan for them, too."

""Is everyone okay?"" the father yelled, stumbling out into the upstairs hall.

Voices answered from other bedrooms along the floor, groggy but present and accounted for--all except one.

""Where's Makayla?""

Both parents were frantic as they went from room to room searching for their missing child, calling her by name.

""What was that?"" asked Ben as he dragged himself from his room, yawning and stretching.

""I don't know,"" said his father as he pushed past his eldest son into his room. ""Your little sister, have you seen her? Makayla! Makayla, are you here, honey?""

Ben shook his head and moved to one side. ""Not since she went to the bathroom, maybe an hour ago. Brat probably detoured for the presents.""

Exchanging a look, both mother and father raced down the stairs to continue their search, their son and older daughter followed.

At the bottom of the stairs, their mother screamed and collapsed against the rail.

Their father choked on his breath as he caught sight of the figures silhouetted by the fireplace fire; one of them the distinct outline of the jolly old saint known as Nick, while the other...

The second figure towered over the first, hunched over as its inhuman form seemed too massive for the human-size room. Great horns dug into the ceiling and cloven hooves scratched deep into the hardwood floor, while on his back he wore a basket, large enough to hold a small, human form.

From the basket came the cries of their terrified youngest daughter, the smell of urine filling the stifling air as it trickled from the bottom of the basket.

Growling, the horned creature whipped at the basket with the chains he held in his hand, quieting the cries to snotty whimpers. Carefully the creature turned its head, regarding the remaining family one last time before he turned and crouched low, climbing through the fire, which set their daughter to screaming again, and, digging into brick and mortar, climbed back up and out of the chimney, shaking the house to its foundation as he went.

Saint Nick laughed as he finished placing his presents beneath the family's tree, crisply wrapped new presents alongside the ones sloppily opened by Makayla. The twinkle in his eye and his jolly smile never wavered. In fact, there was something almost dark about them, something that kept the family fixed where they stood as opposed to pleading for his help. He wouldn't help them.

In his heavily gloved hands, he grabbed up a fistful of cookies from the plate set out for him, and he picked up and downed the entire glass of milk, hot and half curdled from the blistering fire before he turned and disappeared in a flash, the fire extinguishing behind him."

The low rumble of kitty purrs slinks up to my face before I feel its warm body rest on my chest. Looks like someone is demanding scritches! My wife still asleep next to me, I reflect on little moments like this, grateful for the small delights of being alive.

It's amazing what people can get used to. It's been maybe, ten months since the air has been toxic to humans? I only sorta understand the science behind it, it's like a switch flipped due to global warming and the air particles were just the wrong ratio of something to something. To add to the cosmic karma, it seems to only affect humans. ""Nature is healing itself"" the environmentalists say. Either way, the good news is that your basic HVAC system filter is enough to nullify any harmful effects.

Still... nearly a third of the population croaked overnight when the air turned deadly. We mourned the loss but after nearly a year we've just adjusted to the new normal. Those of us who survived have since kept the fans running 24/7 and the house airtight. We stay vigilant, because even leaving the door open for a few hours is enough to cross the line to toxic.

Since then we've adapted. We work remote, we wear gas masks outside, and otherwise limit ourselves to indoor activities. The kids exclusively do remote classes, but we still schedule play dates indoors around different houses.

Anyway, time to start the day. I'm amazed my wife hasn't started sneezing yet, she's allergic to cats. And still amazed she let us get one on the first place!

Wait. WAIT. My vision is tunneling as a single thought enters my head.

We don't own a cat."

Every year, I ask him for some fancy gift or another. I’m not too greedy; I try to keep my list short.1 or 2 items at most. 

After all, the lesser you expect, the lesser you are disappointed, right?

And I am used to being disappointed. 

Santa comes and gives everyone whatever they had asked for. Two years back, Chris got the musical instrument he wanted. Sabrina got her pink bunny-ears last year. Even Velma got that expensive porcelain horse she had asked for.

Everyone gets their favorite presents. 

Everyone, but me. 

Still, I don’t lose hope. 

After all, good things happen if you wait.

I learned that from my dear Rob. Five years back, our restaurant business was going down the crapper.  Looked really bad- Robbie was so close to shutting down the whole thing. Had lost just about everything he had…

But he never lost hope. 

And that’s the reason he has still kept his restaurant running. Not just running- but running in style. The last few months have been so profitable!

I want to make him feel good for his efforts. Want to gift him something nice for Christmas. 

And so the only thing I want from Santa is…a saucepan. A *Branded* saucepan. For my lovely Robbie cook his magic. 

So, I send my request to Santa. Then I wait. 

\*

It’s the night of Christmas eve. Still no sign of Santa.

But I refuse to believe that Santa doesn’t want to make us happy. 

Why wouldn’t he? He has our address. Has our wish-list. Knows about each one of our habits- nice and naughty. And I’ve been a super nice girl this year.

*So why doesn’t he give me what I want*, I wonder. 

My thoughts are interrupted, as the clock strikes midnight. There’s a knock on the door.

Santa’s here!

I look outside the window. Robbie’s meeting Santa. He’s collecting the gifts. Chris' guitar, Sabrina's teddy, Velma’s goggles, some cardboard package that I don’t recognize…and that’s it. 

Santa gets into his van, starts it, and prepares to drive off. Doesn’t even bat an eye at me in the window.

Ignoring me. 

Like he always does.

“Guess what Santa got me, Lin,” Robbie beams at me in the room. “A branded saucepan! Smith & Owens’! Can you believe it?”

“Good for you, Robbo.”

“I know, right? Hey, watch this- hey, saucepan.”

*“Hi Rob,”* he anthropomorphizes the pan.

“So, what do you feel like cooking today?”

*“Oh, I don’t know… How about that fat Amazon delivery guy?”*

“That one? Aww, why didn’t you say before- he just left!”

There’s a loud screech of tires on the street outside.

“*No, he didn’t!*”

Rob chuckles.

“Gotta go, Lin.”

“Uh-huh.”

Rob locks the door.

It hurts to grab the phone with my bandaged arm. I still get it, and leave a negative review on Amazon.

How could they mess up such a simple order?

“Sir, please-” She began desperately. “I just need a bottle of water. I’ll pay you double; if I have to walk across town to another store I’ll pass out.” 


Ruby wasn’t lying or exaggerating. It was over a hundred degrees out, the fact that Ruby had made it to the store closest to her apartment was a miracle. Walking across town on her old, tired legs might very well be the end of her. 


The owner grinned through tobacco stained teeth, holding a shotgun he grabbed from under the counter. “I’ll blow you away if you even try to enter, don’t your kind know how to read?” He pointed his weapon at the sign.


“I’ll pay double, triple, please.” Her lips were chapped and dry. A simple request, a bottle of water, for three times the value. 


For a few seconds she got her hopes up, seeing the owner grab a small water bottle, placing it right beside the entrance. 


“If you can get it without coming inside, it’s all yours.” He smirked, spitting a brown blob of dip from his mouth. “But if you step even one toe in here, I’ll blow you away, N-”


She didn’t hear the rest of the sentence, but she didn’t have to. There was not going to be any appeal to reason, any mercy, any rational dialogue spoken here. 


She sighed, and turned around. A group of five white men were heading towards the store. “Ma’am,” the tallest one said, looking down at Ruby, and tipped his hat. 


Ruby turned around, mostly just to see the store owners face. Naturally, he looked revolted, as if he had just watched the world flip upside down. In a way he had, Ruby doubted he’d ever seen another white man act even a little courteous to a colored woman before. 


She watched the men go inside, before one yanked the shotgun out of the owner's hands. The other four pulled knives out of their pockets while the tallest man began shouting. 


A robbery. Perfect, if she didn't die of thirst, she might be lynched for stealing. 


“Help me! Run in here and do something!” He begged Ruby desperately. 


She did. Ruby honestly almost did, despite having no weapons or chance of fighting this group of men. But stopped herself when she read the sign again.  


“I’m not allowed.” 


The tallest man looked back at Ruby, smiling. Gesturing to the water, he tossed it to her, tipping his hat once again before aiming his firearm at the owner. 


The world was harsh and cruel to Ruby and her family, but today was a sliver of vengeance, a small strike back. 


She turned to go home, savoring the water while reveling in the sound of screams and gunfire, smiling and humming all the way."

A knock on the door caught my wife and I off guard.  It was about 9:30 PM, a little late for visitors.

My wife opened up the door and we found 5 people, dressed identically.  They wore plaid red shirts with red scarves and green hats. 

They were all smiling, which didn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing, but they were smiling a little too big.

The 5 people started singing an excellent rendition of, “We Wish You A Merry Christmas,” in unison.  Honestly, the quality was amazing, too amazing. 

My wife and I listened, impressed until they finished.

That’s when I noticed their eyes, they were changing!  Their pupils started dilating until the black covered their entire eyes.  My wife stood there, frozen, staring at those demented Carolers.

I looked back at them to see that their mouths were all gaping open.  Their chins then lowered in as their jaws stretched inhumanly.  I could hear cracks coming from their jaws as if the bones were breaking.  Their chins stopped after their jaws had stretched some 8 inches, looking horrifying.

That’s when the horrible loud high pitched sound started.  I instinctively put my hands to my ears as the noise grew louder.  Even with my ears plugged, the sound was unbearingly loud.  My wife just stood there as if hypnotized by the Christmas Carolers. 

The volume of the high pitched sound now felt like there was a Jet engine blasting on our doorstep.  I looked at my wife to see blood flowing from her ears.

Panicked, I removed my hand from my left ear to close the door.  The sound was ridiculously painful, and I instantly felt a pop and blood started trickling from my ear.  Those wide-mouthed, black-eyed, screaming monsters still stood there emitting the supersonic noise.  I slammed the door shut, and pulled my unmoving wife away from the door, keeping my right hand over my ear.

I pulled her downstairs as the windows on the front of the house shattered.  Even in the basement, it was painfully loud until it abruptly stopped

I looked down at my beloved bride to see that her eyes were open, but she didn’t move or speak a word.  Blood still flowed freely from her ears.  I immediately called 911.

Even as the paramedics loaded her onto the stretcher, she remained completely catatonic with her eyes wide open, as if frozen in that horrifying moment.  

It’s the morning of Christmas Eve now.  We’re still here in the hospital.

I have been diagnosed with a moderate concussion, and am completely deaf in my left ear.

My wife slipped into a coma shortly after we arrived at the hospital.  She has suffered a severe Subdural Hemorrhage.  They’ve done emergency surgery to stop the bleeding, but the doctors can’t say if she will have permanent brain damage or not.  

Whatever you do, never open the door for the Christmas Carolers from Hell."

If my mind slips away for just a second, it’s gonna end badly. Find something to focus on. The sound of wheels rolling on a snow-covered road. No, too rhythmic. Hypnotic. All the sounds are deceiving. The windshield wipers going *whoosh whoosh whoosh*, the steady drone of the engine. Sirens of alluring sleep. Resist them, Raymond.

Crank open a window. 

It’s so cold. Can’t leave it open for long. Will keep me awake though. I’m still freezing from the rest stop, and that was like what, four hours ago? Wasn’t really a rest stop though, but I had to pee. That was the excuse anyway. Stop in the middle of fucking nowhere to pee. Why am I going back there? Why is my mind wandering?

Shit, nearly missed that turn. Gotta stay in the now, Raymond. Can’t leave the now.

It’s really dangerous. Fucking stupid. My mind keeps getting stuck. Single thoughts going on forever, looping back on themselves. It’s my own fucking brain trying to trick me. Get me to close my eyes without realising I’m doing it. Can’t stop here, Raymond. Gotta keep driving. Gotta get home.

Close the window.

You got that lighter, Raymond, remember? You snuck away for that cigarette. Come on, you can take it. Just a little pain to keep you awake. To keep you going. It’ll heal in no time.

Ouch, fuck!

You froze your ass off in minus twenty degrees for a fucking smoke, but can’t handle a second degree burn? Man, you gotta get your priorities straight. Why do we go back there, though? You want another fucking cigarette break? Fucking hell, you’re losing it again. 

Eyes on the road. 

Phone buzzing. That’s good. Real good. Talking helps. It’s Sarah. She should be sleeping, but I’m glad she’s not. 

“Hey babe.” 

*“Are you close? It’s getting really late, Raymond.”*

“Yeah, yeah. Weather is shit though.”

*“Please, drive safely. I need you back for Christmas in one piece.”*

“Yeah, yeah. Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.”

I feel better already. Lucid. Alert. Mind clearing. Sleepiness fading.

*“How’s Ruby doing? Is she sleeping?”*

I turn to look at Ruby in the backseat, simultaneously realizing why my mind keeps wandering back to that rest stop. I slam the breaks, the car skidding to full stop seconds later.

I just wanted a cigarette so badly.

She just wanted to stretch her legs.

I lost the ability to walk a 2 years ago and it was due to a car crash and it wasn't my fault. I have gotten my financial settlement and support but the one thing I hate about not being able to walk, is the pride of being able to do things all by myself. I was always the type of person who hated being helped or needed other people and now I need other people. I have my down days but I am surviving. I have gone back home to live with my parents and siblings. 

My grandmother also lives with us and a couple of months ago I remember wheel chairing to her room but she wasn't responding. I started to feel a certain sensation in my legs and the more closer I got to my grandmother, the more I could feel something in my legs. As I touched my grandmother I knew straight away that she was dead and I was also able to stand on my legs. 

I couldn't believe it at all and my family couldn't believe it as well. There was my grandmother who was dead and I who can now stand on both my feet while I was touching my grandmother. I stood upon her dead body screaming in joy. When she got buried though I couldn't use my legs anymore. 

We went to other funerals and whenever I touched the dead person, I could actually use my legs. That's when I knew that I could only walk while touching dead people. I missed that feeling of self respect and the ability to do one's own thing by his or her own hand. I hate being disabled. 

A couple of days I needed to feel useful again and I needed to walk on my legs. I got my fathers gun out of his office and I had shot my parents and 3 of my siblings. I am loving being able to walk on their dead body, while at the same time, the dread of my actions is horrifying me. 

I will tell the police when I have finished walking on my family. I wonder how long I could keep on walking on them? I never thought walking would be a privilege and a sin. It feels good to stand on my own two feet like a real man. "

The lights were dimmed, the machines powered down. The floors had been swept and mopped, the tables wiped down and sanitized. The workday was over, and it was time to go home, but Sidney couldn’t do it. She had never been afraid to walk home alone before, but that night, she was terrified.

The shop got new customers all time time, and it was common for them to become regulars. Sidney would learn their names, smile when she saw their familiar faces, even greet them like a friend when they passed through or stayed for their lunch break. It was the highlight of her day to catch up with her regulars, but the man in the large wool coat was not the regular kind of regular.

For starters, he would sit far from the counter, usually at the other end of the shop, and stare. He would sip his drink, savoring it, and just... stare at Sidney. She’d return his gaze for a moment, then frown and look away. No matter how long she ignored him, or now uncomfortable he clearly made her, the man would continue to sip his drink and stare at her, then leave when he was done.

Today was different. As she placed his drink on the counter, the man smiled hungrily at Sidney and mumbled something she couldn’t quite catch. “What?” she asked, against her better judgment.

“See you tonight,” he repeated, smiling again before retreating to his usual spot.

He left after about an hour, but didn’t go far. He crossed the street, posted up near a boarded-up store, and sat against the wall. Sidney couldn’t see for sure that he was staring, but she could *feel* his eyes on her.

The thought of calling the police came to mind, but she didn’t trust them to not escalate the situation. Sidney called her father again, but he wasn’t answering. She tried a few more numbers before settling on a friend, Jaime, who she didn’t know that well. It was a shot in the dark. Luckily, he was available, no questions asked.

As soon as Jaime pulled up, the man in the wool coat got to his feed and stomped across the street, hands in his jacket pockets. Sidney- perhaps through willpower alone- locked the front door to the shop faster than she ever had before, openly running to the passenger seat door of Jaime’s car. She slammed it shut just as the man reached the door, pressing his hands against the glass, one holding a knife. “Who the fuck is this, your *boyfriend?”* he cried, slamming a fist against the glass. Sidney called the cops as Jaime sped off.

The man wouldn’t answer any of the police’s questions, she’d been told, simply laughing at their attempts to get more information. They couldn’t figure out who he was, either, only that his fingerprints weren’t in their records and the blood under his fingernails didn’t belong to him."

It came out of nowhere, my parents came to visit me over the holidays when it was issued and they couldn’t return home. We can’t even leave our house for food, the government supplies us with a package every week, though. And so far, it’s been a real blessing, I don’t have to get up as early for work, and I only have to get half dressed! I could do this forever.

It’s been two months since the quarantine was issued and business meetings have stopped. My company didn’t announce they would, they just, stoped.
 
It’s been three months since the quarantine was issued, and the occasional government news is the only new thing we get from the outside world

It’s been four months since the quarantine was issued and our power and internet has cut out. Guess we’ll have to go without knowing what is going on with the world.
 
It’s been five months since the quarantine was issued, and the government has stoped giving us packages, good thing we have some food

It’s been six months since the quarantine was issued, and I think that it’s finally over, people are moving about in the hallways

I don’t know how long it’s been, but I wish our internet still worked, otherwise I wouldn’t be stuck in this damn closet, and my family would still be here.

Her light brown hair was always slightly unkempt, her gray eyes always had at least slight dark circles, but it was mostly her clothes that caught my attention. All her clothes had at least a few tears, but every tear had a bit of scrap cloth sewn over it, in a way that made her look short of scarecrow-ish. This gave me the impression that someone loved her very much, but couldn’t or wouldn’t buy her new clothes. She also wore an odd necklace, a string of about 15 razor-sharp teeth, shaped like a shark’s but way bigger than those on souvenirs. I asked her where she got them (partly to see if I could get Oliver a better one), she said her family gave it to her. Oliver mentioned she talked about family, but never named specific members. Between this and the torn clothes, I came to the conclusion she might be living in a group home. I brought this up to Oliver, but he didn't care. It escalated to an argument, and I did some things I shouldn't have that night. It was my job to protect Oliver, but instead I hurt him. He was a naturally clumsy child, so I got away with it for longer than most would. He would leave with a black eye or busted lip or a few bruises and it wasn't too special. Yeah, I'm the scumbag who puts his hands on his own child.  
And Talia knew.

One day I saw something odd in the woods near my house. It was like a person, no, group of people, was moving between the trees. It seemed to call me in a weird way, and I walking into the woods before I knew it. A wave of terror came over me when the silhouettes stopped moving and I had time to look at them. There were five, one human and four monstrous. The monstrous were all vaguely humanoid, but they all had claws and bright, glowing eyes. They were 6 and a half, seven, eight, and nine feet tall, and they looked strong enough that any one of them could snap my bones. And the fifth silhouette...well, I could guess the identity. ""T-Talia?"" I stuttered out. ""Cursed are those who harm their own blood."" She said. Their was a sound like a grunt of agreement, and the silhouettes started moving forward. ""We're here to teach you a lesson."" She said, and I froze when I laid eyes on the monsters. They had mouthfuls of teeth, like those on Talias necklace. “What are these creatures?"" I asked, terrified. ""My family, sir."" She said.

***I was going to get my first kiss***.  My girlfriend and I had fallen in love few months back and today was  the day when she promised me that she will let me kiss her, hold her. It  was my very first time.

I was very much excited about it.

We  met near the flowing river in the park. It was 6pm. We walked around  the river for some time until t people were no more seen in the park,  until the sun had gone down enough.

The sun was almost down and the sky had tints of *pink, red and blue*.  She grabbed my hand and took me to a corner. Her hands were soft like  velvet. My hands were cold due to nervousness. She felt and warmly  smiled at me.

We reached the place and the she leaned into me and said\*:\****”go for it”***,  closing her eyes. I hesitated, but gathered all my strength and did it.  It was heaven her lips were soft and it was heaven in there.

When I had started to enjoy it, I suddenly started feeling dizzy. She took my hands and removed them off her body.

I saw a red light coming from side. It was a van. My vision got blurred and I went unconscious.

The next I knew was I had woken up in my house after 2 days!!. I had a kidney missing from my body.

There was a l

etter that had come with me; to my house. It said:

*“Sorry!  But I needed money, so I had to lace my lips with incapacitating agent.  Sorry for ruining your first kiss. I thought to kill you but left you  alive to tell this story to my future preys.”*

It was Christmas. The best period of the year. The small houses and the trees were illuminated by the colored lights that the owners had lit.

The snow that fell from the sky covered all the cars and the yards of the houses. I was sitting on my bed waiting for my parents to come home from work, it was 11 o'clock at night so I assumed they would be a little late. I went downstairs to the living room, sat on the black couch and ate a cookie that my mom had left on a plate on the small wooden table. I turned on the TV with the remote control, waiting for the time to pass. 

 I caught myself sleeping on the black couch for a while and when I woke up I saw the black TV hanging on our white wall. I looked at my watch which my dad gave me last Christmas, it was 12 o'clock, midnight. My parents must have been late now.

Suddenly I saw a TV commercial that kept me interested, the commercial said BRING NOW SANTA CLAUS TO YOUR HOME FREE ONLY FOR THIS DAY. CALL NOW at 800 12 45 21. I thought this would be a good idea to give my parents a surprise so I decided to call the number on the ad and give them my home address. I was so excited that I made milk and cookies to give to Santa Claus as soon as I saw him. I waited for a few minutes until I finally heard the bell of my house ring.""Santa Claus has come"" I shouted with joy and opened the door of my house. But the one I saw was not the Santa Claus. He wore only a Santa Claus mask, a black coat and black trousers. '' Who are you ? '' I ask him. Without answering me, he took a bloody wooden bat that was hidden behind his back and hit me on the head with it.When I woke up I noticed that I was tied with a rope in a huge dining room with other children who were in the same situation as me. Terrified and overwhelmed, I asked one of the children, ""Who is this man?"" ''. The only person who answered me was a little girl who told me '' we do not know his name but I assure you that he is not Santa Claus. ""Sometimes he takes one of us just to eat him.""Eventually the mysterious stranger entered the kitchen saying ""ho ho ho"". I screamed before realizing that I was having a dream, this reassured me, although sometimes I hear a whistle outside of my window even when the wind is not blowing..."

It was a brisk fall morning and the animals on my family's farm were all still resting peacefully, or at least so me and my wife thought. I woke up at 7 to get ready for work which was an hour commute to get to, and I looked out the window to get a rough idea of the weather. As I gazed through the frosted glass I saw a small bright orange blur darting behind the shed. I threw on a light jacket and proceeded outside to investigate. To my horror just off the end of the porch was one of my wife's prize winning horses, Butternut, splayed open as if someone had taken a large knife to the animal. I looked for footprints to give me any sort of sign. The only set I saw however were a rather large set of what appeared to be cat paws heading off towards the shed I was heading to anyways, the only issue I saw was that we didn't own a cat because my wife is allergic. I lightly trotted towards the shed so I could make up for the lost few minutes I had spent staring at the horse's corpse. As I approached the shed I heard scratching like there was a smallish animal, maybe the cat that caused the prints, rummaging through things. I ripped open the door so as to frighten the animal out, I had hoped, but much to my surprise as the door finished it's swing on it's rusted hinges, the animal jumped out aimed right for my face. The last thing I saw as the light faded was a shiny neon yellow cat's eye that appeared to glow ever so faintly. I awoke 2 days later in a hospital bed with a hankering for fish, which was weird for me because I couldn't stand the smell of fish after living by the water for most of my childhood. Fish and milk was what seemed the best meal to consume. That's exactly what I ordered when the nurse came in to answer my buzzer, which was respectably greeted with a very precarious look. A day later I was at home sleeping in my own bed eating my wife's home cooked meal of chicken, taters, and a side of biscuits and gravy, when I heard a low rumble like a car's engine. But I knew that sound, that was the master calling for me, I must go to him...""Wait what?"" I suddenly said out loud. My wife turned and stared in confusion, which gave way to horror, I tried to ask why she looked like that but she fainted before the words came out. I didn't have time to try again.

The inarticulate holiday maker that I am, I didn't know much German. All I knew was the first bit, ""Lauf,"" which means ""run"".

I could tell by the disturbed look on his face and the sincerity of his voice that this wasn't a prank, but as I looked around at the calm and empty street and the mundane, inactive red brick houses that lined it, I wondered what exactly was it that I was supposed to be running from? My mind flooded with imagined scenarios.

Perhaps a disturbed person was stalking the streets stabbing random people? Had the pressures of urban life got to someone? You hear about these things in the news but you never think it's going to happen to you, until it does. Still walking slowly and keeping a cautious eye on all directions, I pulled out my phone, hoping to get a Wi-Fi signal and check news stories but no. I tried calling my friend but it went to voicemail. We were supposed to be meeting at the zoo in five minutes.

As I continued walking cautiously in silence and isolation, I started entertaining stranger ideas, like the breakout of urban civil war, or a recently discovered bomb threat, domestic terrorism, freak localised natural disasters, sinkholes. My eyes darted in all directions. I felt my armpits clamming up. My heart was beating faster. *What was it? What was I supposed to be running from?*

After five minutes of walking alone with barely a sound, within an instant I knew EXACTLY what it was. My eyes widened as the intimidating beast nonchalantly strutted out from the urban corner with blood around its mouth and most of its face.

I was frozen on the spot in complete terror. This was literally the stuff of nightmares. My head rushed with obscure facts about animal behaviour, when to run, when not to run, etc. But none of them seemed helpful now on this open street with only me and *it* and seemingly nobody else around.

For some reason, probably because it had just fed on several fully-grown pedestrians, it was disinterested in me and continued strolling down the road. I didn't stick around to see what happened, but apparently a special task force apprehended it at the end of the road and put it back in its cage.

Still now, the events of that day whirl around and around in my head. ""Luvre"" the German word I thought I'd heard was actually ""lowe""; Lion. ""Lowe auf freiem fuB"" means ""Lion at large!"" Which is what I think the man shouted. If it hadn't already fed on my friend before making its way to my street, I'd probably be dead. His phone was never recovered."

I’d just ordered coffee at the café, when a woman screamed from downstairs. Everyone stopped to look. I rushed to the balcony and looked down to see a mother screaming, holding her son, who was choking, as his face turned blue. I sprinted downstairs, flashing my medical badge, then hurried to the boy. I made a fist, covered it with my other hand, then pressed in and upwards three times before the peppermint candy he had eaten dislodged. The mint shot from his throat straight through the crowd, smacking an elderly woman in the center of her forehead, like a dart hitting a bulls eye.

“Thank you!” the mother gushed, patting my arm.

I smiled back. “Happy to help.”

That’s when I met the elf.

“Hello,” a voice said from behind me. I spun around to see one of Santa’s elves looking up at me with a mischievous grin. 

He stuck out his hand. “Name’s Randy,” he said.

I smiled. “Tyler,” I said, shaking his hand.

“Let me buy you a coffee, doc,” Randy said. 

I agreed. I mostly listened as he chatted about his job at the mall.

“Doesn’t it feel like we’ve known each other a long time?” he said.

It didn’t, but I smiled politely, then told him I was late for a meeting.

“Leaving already?” he asked.

Something in his voice sounded…off.

Lisa was already seated when I arrived at the restaurant. We gazed into each other’s eyes over oysters and wine, reminiscing about when we met. Suddenly, a man’s chirpy voice jolted us from our lovers’ reverie.

I jumped, then yelped when I saw Randy standing at the table, grinning at us, his elf-hat half-hanging off his head. His blue eyes twinkled in the candlelight, suddenly looking sinister.

“Doc, we need to talk,” he said. 

After I’d followed him into the bathroom, Randy barricaded the door with a trashcan, then forced me into the corner. 

“What the hell is going on?” I asked.

The lights in the bathroom flickered, as electricity crackled and hummed. His blue eyes blazed like an unholy fire, then rolled back into his head. When the lights flickered on, his face was translucent, the color of death, and his eyes had become black holes that bore into the innermost depths of my being. His voice had morphed into a low, guttural growl like a demon.

“Your time has come,” he warned me, tossing his head back in maniacal laughter.

“Death awaits you!” he cackled. 

The lights flickered off, then on again. But this time, Randy was gone."

On Christmas morning I couldn’t believe my eyes! My dad was there to spend the day with me. It had to be a dream, except I pinched myself and didn’t wake up.

We unwrapped gifts together and I apologised for not having one ready for him.

*I don’t need many things where I’m staying. Just promise me you will always honor your word.*

Promise.

I hugged him as hard as I could and I cried for longer than I would like to admit. We played football in the backyard and he stayed for lunch and dinner as well. I told him how much I missed him, especially at night when he used to tuck me into bed. I fell asleep while he told me stories about Bruce, for which I never got to hear the end.

I opened my eyes to find nothing but darkness and a red glow coming from the other side of the door. It must have been a dream! The door opened to reveal a world of fire that lit up the room and a set of stairs leading to the underground.

It was boiling hot. Sweat ran from my forehead to my cheeks and onto my lips. I didn’t know what to think when a voice arose from the cracking flames.

I backed against the window trying to escape, only to notice that the house was melting. When the objects had disappeared and the bedroom was no longer my own, a piece of folded paper stood out.

David was a professional griper. He bemoaned Amazon. Jeff Bezos was his archnemesis. 

David’s bookstore failed due to much more than his Oscar the Grouch demeanor. It needed a healthy dose of TLC from the Queer Eye Fab 5. David’s skin was so weathered by Father Time that Jonathan would’ve fainted. Tan would have taken one look at his dad’s jeans and beat-up old tennis shoes and gasped. Bobby would have seen the piles of unorganized books and walked out.

Karamo and Antoni –– you get the picture. That bookstore, and David’s entire life, needed a facelift. But somehow he kept the place open while other bookstores went under. 

David’s true passion was his children’s summer reading program. He often talked about starting one for adults. 

Every summer, a dozen kids signed up. For every book they read, they got a sticker on a big reward chart. Read enough; they’d get prizes. That kind of shit. 

The kids loved reading, but David said it was ephemeral. 

“Ephemeral,” said David, looking at me like I was a complete fucking idiot. “Lasting for a very short time.”

One day, David told me to grab some books from the basement. When I got down there, I noticed a man. He was stumbling around blindly. He’d just come out a door with an open padlock.

The man turned to me. His eyes were shriveled like pale, fossilized raisins, blind as a bat. He was so emaciated his bones practically poked through his paper-thin skin. 

“Please…please help…”

I saw that the man’s eyelids were stitched open.

Behind him, others filed out of the room, moaning like zombies. Their eyes were stitched open, too, fossilized and blind. On the wall, I saw a reading reward chart. It was covered with hundreds of stickers.

I felt a sudden presence. It was David, a disturbing grin on his face, needle and thread in hand. 

“You got me,” he said. “Selling a dozen books a month wasn’t enough anymore. I wanted to make a real difference in the world. Didn’t realize their eyes would dry out. Silly me. But I’m a book lover, not an optometrist.”

The blind, once-human creatures grabbed me, begging for help. David advanced with the needle and thread. 

“Hold him still ––”

Driven by pure instinct, I burst past David and up the stairs. Once outside, I called the cops. But by the time they arrived, the place was engulfed in flames. David’s precious books fueled the fire, swallowing his grim operation whole. 

To this day, I read an hour a day, thanks to David Crosby’s Reading Program. I suspect he’s looking up from Hell, pleased as punch."

I returned home after a long sojourn away and discovered my dog had worms coming out of her body and kept whining at night. I think she had an infestation of the mango fly. And since nobody had been taking care of her since I traveled, my wife decided to change her diet which only made matters worse.

At dinner time, I could see the worms fall off the dog's body and crawl around on the kitchen floor. My wife then gathered them in a bowl and fed them back to her. I almost drowned on my vomit, gagging, watching the dog gobble down those disgusting whitish horrors from hell.

Over the night, the whining eased completely and I heaved a sigh of relief. The next morning, I went out back to see how she was doing. I found her lying in her cage fast asleep. I called out her name softly and she turned around to look at me.

My blood froze!!!

In place of her eyes were a mass of crawling, twitching worms, moving furiously in each eye socket.

Laurie!!! I cried out.

He slapped himself to wake up. It didn't work, but it did sting.

He started walking. He continued walking until his legs felt like rubber. He walked until he could walk no more. After that he started crawling.

He continued crawling, making progress slowly but surely.

He suddenly felt something behind him. He paled when he felt something pull his ears. He turned around to see something incomprehensible. Something he would never understand if he lived seven lifetimes. He saw the devil. And just then, he realized he was dead.

After three nights, every single human on Earth had been destroyed. The terror had conquered it all through the powers of sleep and nightmares. 

Finally, a sense of satisfaction arose. In the shred of human left in the terror, there was a feeling of accomplishment. His goal was fulfilled. His power was limitless.

Finally, he could rest.

He curled up on the hill to sleep. Three restless nights take their toll, even when driven by unrelenting anger. 

The desolate city spread out below him. Empty streets and quiet houses sang their hauntingly silent lullaby to the creature. 

Slowly, terror incarnate fell asleep. 

He dreamed of destruction. He dreamed of feeding on the nightmares of higher beings.

He dreamed of *revenge*. 

As the sun rose on an empty world, the terror woke. 

There was another presence in his mind. It made no attempt to hide. This alien entity grew until it manifested as another beast. It burst from inside, destroying the terror in an instant.

A creature of deepest horror rose from the corpse, a product of the nightmares consumed and dreamt by the terror. 

It towered over the haunting scene, its dark, evil eyes searching for any sign of life to consume. It had no real shape. It was but a shadow on the morning sky, its edges blending and morphing in the light. 

It continued to grow and search. Seeing that no living thing was left on the planet, it looked upward. It locked eyes with the ones above. And it rose. 

It rose above the planes of physical existence and swallowed the earth in the process. It rose until it stood face to face with the Council. The entities who stood for the good of existence. Who kept the terror bound. 

Though the terror was gone, his fury manifested itself in this shadowy horror. The desire for revenge persisted. And it wouldn't let the Council hold it back any longer. 

*Stop.*

***Why?***

And after two spectral words, the horror swallowed the Council, sentenced to an endless nightmare. 

There was nothing in the way. His revenge was fully complete. 

The shadow horror spread through reality with a hunger no dream could satiate. Driven by rage, it devoured everything.

In the wake of a nightmare, darkness consumed all."

I burrowed in. Trying to carve out some sort of hole. I'd get one eventually. There always is a little squishy bit inside the hard exterior.

It was found in Egypt a few years back. Two archeologists found a trumpet made of beryllium bronze that dated back to around 150 AD. 


One blew the horn, and immediately started bleeding from every orifice, expiring quickly. The other heard a voice in his head, commanding him. 


“BE NOT AFRAID” 


Of course, the man was terrified. A giant eye with circular rings around it, also covered in eyes, appearing in front of him, asking what he wished to know. 


That’s when we got involved. We heard his testimony, and allowed him to work for us in exchange for secrecy. He agreed. 


Here’s our theory: the trumpet, when blown, kills the user, but summons an Angel for the survivors. An actual, biblical depiction of an Angel, and after seeing it a few times, I can see why they tell us to not be afraid. 


We ran tests on it, we have death row inmates at our disposal, people nobody would miss if they vanished, so we had them blow the horn and interviewed the Angel after they expired. 


It told us about the cosmic war between good and evil, about both Heaven and Hell, and how it’s creator is worried about the outcome of humanity. 


We had to test confirmation of the afterlife, of course. We had two subjects blow the horn, one was a female volunteer, the other a male serial killer, and the Angel confirmed that they had gone to Heaven and Hell, respectively. 


We brought them back so they could tell us about it. The male woke up screaming that he spent too long in the fire, and died of shock moments later.  


The female just stayed silent, before whispering she wanted to go back. She escaped her bonds, and slashed her own throat to die again. 


Curiosity got the best of me. We were told not to ask about our personal fates, but after seeing the test results, I couldn’t resist. I used a rapist to blow the horn, then asked the Angel if I was destined for Heaven or Hell. 


“HELL, OF COURSE.”


“But why?” I had asked. “I work with preternatural enemies, protecting the general public from horrors beyond imaging. That should merit a good afterlife, right?”


“YOU KILL PEOPLE AS TEST SUBJECTS, NO?” It was not a question. “YOU HAD A MAN SOUND THE TRUMPET, DESPITE KNOWING HE WOULD PERISH, TO ASK ABOUT YOUR OWN FATE.”


“YOU, AND ALL YOU WORK WITH, ARE BOUND FOR HELL.”


“What about the greater good?” I asked. “We protect people, those sacrifices need to be made!”


“YOUR BELIEF IN THAT IS WHAT DAMNS YOU.” It said, before vanishing. 


Well, now I know myself and everyone I work with is doomed to a mind numbing eternity of pain. 


Do I tell them? Or just keep working?"

“Is there really nothing you can do?”

“No, I’m sorry”

“I just don’t want him to hurt anymore”, 

“I understand, we’ll take good care of him, it won’t hurt a bit”

The voices went quiet. I took another look around at the gray walls around me, the floor beneath me was cold, and I only had a thin blanket for warmth. I tried to close my eyes and wish myself away, but no matter how hard I tried, the horror of my situation remained. Suddenly the cell door swung opened, and a pair of hands pulled me out and onto an examination table. I tried to stand, only to have the hands pull me back down. I looked around at the strange devices around me, tools meant to poke, and prod at me. I felt like I was going to throw up. 

“Hello, you must be Max.” I turned to the young woman, watching as she slowly put on a thin pair of gloves, “I’ll be your nurse this evening”.

I fought against the hands holding me down on the table, but every form of movement would send another wave of pain pulsing through my stomach, throwing me back down. I lay on the cold table whimpering, Please I thought, I don’t want to die. 

“It’s ok Max, it’ll all be over soon” said the nurse, softly running her hand through my hair. Her voice was soft and kind, but I knew it was all a hoax. I glared at her; this woman who dared try to sympathize with me.

“Hey Max”

 My heart nearly leapt out of my chest as I lifted my head to see Alice; my dear friend Alice. She came to save me. I almost cried as she wrapped her arms around my neck, her gentle tears running down my back. I wished I could stay in her arms forever, but the moment ended too soon. She loosened her grip on my neck and stepped away from me. She looked up to the nurse, her eyes still full of tears “Do I have to be in the room?”

“Of course, not dear” replied the nurse, her voice soft with empathy. I tried to look into Alice’s eyes, but she wouldn’t even look at me.

 I tried to stand, but felt a sharp stabbing pain in my shoulder. I turned and saw a man, injecting a clear liquid into my bloodstream. I turned back to Alice, who was being led out of the room by the nurse. I tried to call out to her, to ask what I did wrong, but my tongue went numb. I could feel myself getting weaker, tears filled my eyes, Alice, please, don’t leave me. My eyelids grew droopy and began to fall. I tried to listen, straining to hear the sound of my friend sobbing in the hallway. I didn’t know what I did wrong. I was a good boy, wasn’t I? I was a good dog. I looked down at my paws, my vision fading in and out, I wanted to call out to her, tell her I was sorry, but her sobs faded away, leaving me alone in the darkness."

The creaking was just the latest symptom of the worst year of Joe’s life. He was collecting ailments like a magnet rolling through iron shavings. His limp started a month ago, the blurry vision not long after. Soreness, stiffness, insomnia, nausea: those were all constant companions these days. Each day, Joe lost a little more mobility, a little more control. But he chalked it up to growing older, even though he was only a few years past forty. 

One December day, Joe woke up unable to unbend his left arm. It had become stuck while he was sleeping. His elbow was locked at a 45-degree angle. The skin was cold and gray and hard to the touch. Joe did not go to the doctor. He lived alone, isolated but self-sufficient. Wiry and short, Joe took care of all of the chores on the property: the firewood, the garden, rebuilding the barn. The elbow would loosen up, he told himself. 

So Joe left to cut new boards for the barn. It was cold. The yard and the woods around it were covered in snow. Putting on a jacket with one good arm was tough; working a saw even tougher. Joe was lucky to only nick his hand with the blade. There was no blood. Instead, Joe’s palm grew gray and rough. He tapped it with the saw and heard a *clink*. 

“Huh,” Joe said. 

He decided to call it a day, limping inside to try to sleep off whatever was going on. Joe was a steady man, he didn’t rattle. But the way his arm and hand were starting to go numb, well, it was distracting. Not watching where he was going, Joe banged his knee into the side of the sawhorse. 

Cold. 

Joe gasped at the sudden loss of feeling at the point of impact. All sensation retreated like the tide fleeing the beach. Cursing, he hobbled towards his house. Joe wasn’t a fan of doctors but his right leg was now one solid piece, fused together at the joint. His phone was upstairs in the bedroom, he was pretty sure, probably still charging. 

The numbness was spreading; Joe moved quick. He nearly made it to the top of the staircase when he missed a step with his stiff leg. Joe felt himself shatter during the fall. Wherever his body slammed into the wooden stairs, an eruption of agony went off like a signal flare. Worse than the pain was the cold that came after, the absence. Joe lay at the bottom of the stairs, twisted into a knot. 

Each bruise hardened until it was gray and solid. Joints fused, limbs stuck at violent angles. Joe screamed but only for a few moments. Then his jaw locked. Broken and frozen, Joe wept until even his eyes became stone."

   All the while, I have to look at other stories get hundreds or thousands of upvotes. I've tried everything, from writing across different settings to completely swapping genres, to get that kind of attention. It just really crushes my self-esteem, and I can't deal with it anymore.

   I even tracked down someone who got 3,000 upvotes on their story a couple of weeks ago, it was that guy who wrote about jellyfish, he hasn't posted anything since then. He had posted an old selfie on another subreddit and mentioned the city he lives in on his professional website, so I decided to visit him and see if I could learn how such well-received ideas got into his brain.

   He was neither helpful nor understanding of how soul-crushing it is to not receive recognition. He just kept telling me to leave and absolutely refusing to hear me out. Long story short, things eventually escalated and, when it became clear he wasn't going to help me, I had to use more forceful methods of getting inside his head.

   I guess it was naive of me, but the next day I wrote a new story with a fresh sense of purpose. I thought for sure that you guys would love it and that what I learned from him would help me. I got three upvotes. Three! Fucking three! I can't deal with this anymore. If eating someone's brain won't help me here then nothing will.

I guess it was a little premature of me to give up, after all, I may be many things, but I'm not a quitter. There are so many talented, inspired contributors here and just because the imagination of one author didn't meet my expectations shouldn't stop me from picking the brains of others."

So I reproduced with my wife again while pregnant and afterwards we had gotten another scan. This time our son had two arms now and my wife was relieved a little. 

We then reproduced again while my wife was pregnant and we did this to give our son another leg, and it had worked. Our son now had two arms and two legs. We reproduced twice more to give our son an extra eye and an ear so that he could become more normal. 

This idea of normal started to irritate my wife and when I reproduced with my wife again to give our son a nose, the scan now showed our unborn baby to be a normal baby now. Then my wife urged me to reproduce with her again many more times and we both did. 

Through the scan our unborn son now had many extra arms, legs, eyes, eats and noses. My wife was smiling as she told me that no body in the real world likes normal and that our son will be famous when he is born. 

My wife wants to make my son more extraordinary for when he is born, and she wants me to reproduce with her more but I don't want to. This has caused lots of arguments between us to the point of breaking up. "

“The hell you waiting for you sick freak?” the man inside asked.

The old man knew it was meant to be a scream, yet all that reached him was a mere croak.

“Ah, my dear Mathew,” the old man started in a voice dripping with honey, “how are you this fine day?”

“Fuck you,” the man inside spat at him.

The old man laughed and stepped into the room with a bright smile on his face.

“Guess you’re having one of those days, aren’t you, Mathew?”

This time he got no answer, just as expected.

For a moment the old man stops, sniffed the air, and his face changed to an expression of faked shock.

“My god, Mathew, I think you’re in dire need of a bath, how about-“

“Why the hell did you come down here? To make a few more of your sick jokes?”

“Now, why’d I do that? I was going to bring you some food, Mathew. You know, I want you to be healthy. But since we’re talking about health, you might want to move those arms and legs of yours a little. It will keep your muscles from cramping and those joints from hurting.”

“You ARE hurting, aren’t you, Mathew?” he asked with an exhilarated expression and hungry eyes.

“Go fuck yourself, I’m done playing your games!”

The old man laughed.

“Then how about I ask you a question, instead. What is true terror? Is it the fear you feel when I enter this room?”

Mathew answered with nothing but a grin.

“Is it the pain of your muscles tearing and your joints dislocating?”

Nothing.

“Is it the deterioration of your mind? The fact that you don’t know what will happen to you, how long you’ve been here and that in time, you might not even know who you are anymore?”

Once again, no reaction.

Suddenly the old man’s face showed childish glee before he began laughing again. This time, it’s a throaty, hysterical laugh, one that makes Mathew cringe back.

No,"" the old man brought out between bouts of laughter.

“True terror is hope.”

And with that, he placed the key to Mathew’s chains on the floor, just barely out of his reach."

Sure, she didn’t have any so-called ‘evidence’ that whoever drove the white van was up to no good, but it was the *consistency* in which they’d drive up to the woods past her home that concerned her. Every month, just after the full moon, they’d come up the winding road from town, right past her house and up to the woods. There weren’t any other homes up there. As far as Kate was concerned, they were *clearly* up to no good.

Finally, after she threatened to follow the white van herself if they didn’t send a Deputy to investigate, they decided to do their damn job. Kate watched the green and yellow car drive up that winding road, past her home and down to the end of the path up ahead.

She started to get worried when the red and blue lights up ahead began to flash, but when what must have been the entire rest of the Sheriff’s Department came up that winding road in a parade of red and blue lights, the worry was replaced with a self-congratulatory sense of validation. Something bad *was* happening past her house, and if they’d listened to her earlier, it might have been taken care of a lot sooner!

The gunshots were sudden, and didn’t last long. The ambulances joined the authorities shortly after, trailed by police cars from the city. With them taking part in whatever was being investigated, Kate realized, something *big* was happening at the end of the trail.

Despite the part she played, Kate was kept in the dark about what they found until the public learned about it in the news. Last May, a daycare in town had burned to the ground, but none of the staff or children were there. As it turned out, they were at the end of the trail, in a bunker.

Kate hated unanswered questions, but from what the news was reporting, *no one* knew why the kids had been taken, and that wasn’t going to change any time soon. The staff members had all gone down in the gunfire.

As for the kids… well, at least their parents could give them proper burials."

I stop in the middle of the living room: there's a layer of smoke on the floor, as a mist. It's lighted by the light coming from Konrad.

«Konrad?».  
My voice is chocked.

«*Kom*, Julio! *Kom*! This game is *wundabar*!»

I move to the bedroom, slowly.  
«Did you smoke again inside?»

«*Nein*, Julio»  
«Why you're mixing German?» I ask when I am almost at the door. «You always talk a perfect Engli&#x2013;»

I cannot end the sentence: a figure is sitting in front of the screen. The desktop computer emits a continuous stream of smoke that makes that mist on the floor.  

The figure is dressed with a wide, black military uniform without insignias. His skin is pale green and stretched on the bones, almost without any sign of muscles.

Its bald head turns to me and its black eyes, with a white dot placed on the pupils, point me. The mouth is without lips, exposing his teeth in grin.

«I don't know, *lieber freund*» he says.  
«I really don't know»"
kiot8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kiot8a/clean_shaven/,Clean Shaven,45,7,1608709283.0,"I laid in bed restless. I had been trying to fall asleep for hours now to no avail. I reached my hand over to the empty side of the bed, forgetting just like every other sleepless night. I brought the hand back over to scratch my chin. The hair was beginning to irritate me.

I figured now was a better time to shave than any, maybe it would even tire me out a bit. Walking to the bathroom I didn’t turn on any lights, instead I fumbled down the hallway reaching my arms out to better help feel my way there.

The overhead light in the bathroom burned my eyes. I had grown so accustomed to the hours of darkness that I stumbled backwards, slamming my upper back into the towel rod that hung on the wall. At first there was pain but I began to enjoy the sensation as it lingered. 

Hair began to accumulate in the bathroom sink below. The sharpness of the razor made quick work of the unkempt lawn that adorned the lower half of my face. It wasn’t long until the job was done. I wasn’t finished though. I kept shaving, peeling the skin away from flesh. Blood oozed down my face as I carved away at every inch of skin. I worked upward, separating the hair from atop my head.

I just kept shaving. I was stuck in between the feelings of unimaginable pain and pure bliss. I winced as I laid my fingers atop my head. I left the fingers up there, slowly dragging them across my face, shivering as I felt them move. 

This is what heaven felt like. I knew that now without uncertainty. My eyes began to flutter, finally I felt like I would sleep. I made my way back down the hallway, much more confident in my movements this time, not needing to feel my way as I maneuvered without hindrance. I laid back down in my bed, scratched my chin, and closed my eyes."

I was stupid at the time and, unfortunately, I was the type to disrespect everyone. Almost everyone, that is. My father was the only exception.

I had been quite upset earlier during the week and said some very hurtful things to my stepmom. She wasn't going to let it slide. She told us to sit at the table so we could talk. My father ended up getting very agitated, and this resulted in a one- sided yelling fit. My stepmother was very calm, or just didn't care enough to yell with him, which only infuriated my father more. He picked up a shot glass from the  bar, smashed it to the ground, and kept arguing with my stepmom. It kept getting worse and worse until they were both yelling at the top of their lungs. It hurt to see the only mother like figure in my life getting yelled at for expressing her feelings. I couldn't take it anymore and shouted,

""This is Stacy all over again!""

Stacy was my human incubator, aka my biological mom. She and my father used to argue like this all the time, so when he turned to me I knew I'd struck a nerve. I knew he was upset, but I didn't think he was so lost in his rage that he'd actually attempt to hit me. As soon as he raised his hand to strike me, my stepmother lost it and said ""Back the f\*ck off! You will take my life before you even think about hurting them!""

My father turned back to my mother and wrapped his hands around her neck, looking ready to kill. My stepmother didn't even flinch. 

""\[name\], leave."" She said to me. I wanted to scream at my father to stop, to hit him, something, but I knew he was stronger than me and that I didn't have a chance. I just nodded and left, going outside and finding solace in the cold wind that caressed my cheeks ever so softly.

They are both alive, but that situation has left me with many emotional scars."

kiihhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kiihhp/think_like_a_magician/,Think like a magician!,17,3,1608685049.0,"One interesting thing I’ve learned as a magician is that a magic trick does not have to be perfect. In fact, props don’t have to be fully realistic. For example, one popular trick looks to the audience as though the magician is turning a handkerchief into an egg, then breaking the egg to prove it is real. In reality, the magician is actually quickly stuffing the handkerchief into the hole in a plastic egg, then opening it to release a false yolk and some soap.

Of course, any audience member who closely examines the egg would immediately know that it is not real. But that doesn’t matter. If you know your audience and perform the trick correctly, it will work even if the prop is obviously fake. The beauty of this is that you can apply this to anything in your life. Think like a magician, and you can motivate others to see things the way you want them to be seen.

Think of a plain stack of white papers. Anyone who examines it can tell you exactly what it is. But if you work in a standard office job and are avoiding a task, that doesn’t matter. You can take a stack of printer paper, place whatever paper you’re working on at the top, and tell your boss that he should assign the next task to your coworker because you’re too busy.

Another example is a small piece of lint. If you go to a restaurant, you can just drop it onto the tablecloth, squish it in your napkin, and throw the napkin away. More often than not, the staff will offer to comp your meal so that you won’t make too much of a fuss. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t look real. The audience is looking at you, not the prop, so you’re the one who has to seem real.

This especially works if the audience’s mindset has them primed to see things the way you want to. For example, a mother whose baby has been taken would do anything to save the child. She’d even cut off her own ears! If you perform the trick correctly, it doesn’t matter that the Ashton Drake “Katie” doll with simulated breathing and heartbeat doesn’t look perfectly realistic."

Including Alyssa and I. Luckily for us, we were already suited up. Can’t say the same for the ones wearing plain clothes, I suppose they’re hard as meteors now and doing what meteors do.

We’re holding hands, Alyssa is screaming, I can see that but I can’t hear nothing except my heavy breathing in this helmet as we spin over and over like Ferris wheels in space.

\*\*\*

We are falling, caught in the gravity of great rocks, but she slips away, is tugged a different direction and I this direction towards a golden-brown planet. I get one chance to look back and I swear I think see her going towards the moon. 

The next moment I'm a screaming fireball heading towards the planet alone.  

\*\*\*

She’s over there, and I’m over here. It’s been this way for a couple decades, I think.

I've walked the whole planet, and its all rock, lifeless. Never found my body either, must have burned up completely. So, everyday, I sit and wait for the moon to cycle back into view. And when it does, I just stare at it and it’s like I’m looking at her face. Some nights I’ll even masturbate to the image. 

Like tonight, although…is that another astronaut on her moon. He must have tumbled onto it while I wasn’t watching. I squint real hard. And see a pair of dark figures running their hands over each other’s surfaces. “Alyssa!” I shout. 

The torment of my heart is too great. Too much emotional pain, I decide to convert it to physical and beat my head against a rock for an hour or so. 

When I look back, I realize what I mistook for two shapes screwing was actually a crater. 

\*\*\*

Something smashed against the moon, something heavy. It was too quick to see. One moment, I’m staring at her, and the next she is pieces, flying away from me like birds from a disrupted nest.

“Take me with you!” I scream at her moon. 

But the moon doesn’t hear me or it chooses to ignore, and I jump and try to fly away, but then fall back down to the ground, and I wonder how much my soul weighs and if this planet even feels the restless shuffling of its lone occupant."

First I notice the unbearable smell. It’s so thick I can almost taste it. I’m gagging, and suddenly the lights turn on.

I’m sitting in a yellow room, facing a wall with dozens of small holes. My head feels heavy and I try to take a few steps. When I look around, I can't help but vomit.

A pile of rotting bodies lies in the corner of the room. Some of them seem fresh, but some are badly decomposed. Worms are feasting on something that probably used to be a leg.

I hear a cracking noise, and something falls on my head. I shake it off and realize there are holes in the ceiling too. From every single hole there's something pouring into the floor.

Snakes. Hundreds and hundreds of snakes. I panic and look around, and see an opening on the next wall. I run towards it and struggle my way into a dark hallway.

As soon as I'm out of the room, a light turns on at the end of the hallway. I can't see anything but darkness in the other direction, so I start walking towards the light. My vision gets blurry and my skin starts to itch. I look at my hands, and they look severely burned. Acid. There's acid in the air.

I hear eerie music playing in a room to my left. The door is open, but stained with blood. Nope, not going there.

I pick a dark room with windows, but as I walk in, the floor breaks under me and I fall into a pile of broken glass. I almost pass out from the pain, but somehow manage to crawl my way out. Everything starts to feel like a dream.

I don't know how long I've been here. Hours, days? Sometimes I see light, sometimes I hear music. But wherever I go, there's pain. Chemicals and traps. Torture. At some point I think a large animal was after me.

With my last strength I follow a comforting scent of vanilla. Behind a corner I see an elevator. Without thinking I go in, and press the only button: ""UP"".

I find myself in a large, well lit room. Everything's quiet. With bloody hands I pick up a notebook from the floor.

“You made it out!”, I read from a worn-out paper. “Now, for the fun part! Behind you, you can find the control panel for our little playground.""

I turn around and see a panel with buttons and screens. I step closer and recognize the yellow room, now filled with men in protective gear, in one of the monitors. 

""Our next participant will be ready shortly. You must guide them through. Fail to do so and we will gas this room. It won’t be a pleasant death, we guarantee it. But, if you get our friend to the elevator, the door next to you will open, and you are free to leave.

We’ve celebrated every holiday together this year, despite people complaining to us. 


“You’re gonna get people sick!” So what? I’m healthy and it’s basically just the flu. 


All this fake news makes my blood boil. Shutting down the country? Over a virus? What do scientists know anyway? They’re still insisting on climate change, and it snowed just last night! 


We did everything together, I drove into town to celebrate my mom's birthday; she just turned 58 a few months ago, but she doesn’t feel “at risk” at all! We all gathered at my brothers for the 4th of July, sharing cigars and launching fireworks from our backyard. 


Thanksgiving I got angry. I was so sick of these restrictions, people telling me what to do, how to wear my mask, where I can and cannot go. 


People laughed at me when I told them my entire family was coming over for Thanksgiving, they called me stupid, uneducated, selfish; any of the buzzwords people use nowadays to make you stop thinking for yourself. 


They were all wrong. In fact, they spent the night in my guest rooms, I hadn’t slowed rent collection for my tenants in the building I owned, so I spared no expense upgrading to a nicer home this year, full of extra rooms and private bathrooms. 


Christmas was easy to plan for, after all, my family was still over from Thanksgiving. 


I set out plates for everyone gathered around the table. They were hard to lift, but I got everyone seated comfortably. I ask if anyone would like to say Grace, and they all just look at me blankly.


The ham I made was great, but nobody seemed into it. In fact, I’m wondering if I should turn the heat up, everybody feels so cold lately. They all got a little sick before, but once they stopped coughing I knew they had recovered just fine, as I predicted. This little virus wasn’t that big of a deal, it just made everyone kind of quiet. Plus, they stopped cleaning up so well, they smell a little.


I picked everyone up and set them around the couch, giving Dad the big recliner he likes.  My Mom was slouched over, but I think she just had a little too much wine with dinner. That might be my fault, I was practically pouring it onto her. 


My brother and sister share the futon, each leaning on the other. They need to get outside more, they both look so pale. The news comes on, displaying that fake death toll they keep rattling about. I laugh with my family, knowing it was exaggerated.


After all, my family got sick for a little, but they all pulled through. It really wasn’t that bad.


The media has a bias, they tend to exaggerate these things. 


“Merry Christmas.” I tell my family, and for a second I almost hear them whisper it back.

All through the night I heard screams of anguish. Everyday I’d go outside and look at the Weeping Willow in all her beauty. She had been ripped apart, her limbs were scattered. I could here in that hollow trunk, the sounds of someone trapped in endless torment.

I had bought this farm to grow plants and succeed my father. No one ever believed I would do it, make it to the top. I was going to prove them wrong. I had a dream, and once you start working on that dream, there’s no going back.

The sad part was, it was almost winter. The air grew colder and colder each day and I wanted my dearest Willow to be safe, during the brisk weather.

I came to a conclusion and decided, that I would but the girl out of her misery. There was nothing else to be done.

I grabbed my tree chopping axe and carried it to my Weeping Willow solemnly. It’s for the better, I had thought multiple times as I walked towards my Willow.

I hesitated, I sunk back into myself. Finally, I slowly raised the axe in cutting position. I could hear her pleading. I had to, she wasn’t gonna survive the winter as strong as she was, my Weeping Willow. So..

I swung.

The last thing I saw before I ran back inside, sobbing, covering my face, were Weeping Willow’s eyes.

Stained with red tears."

It’s a force of nature—like quicksand. You can’t reason or argue with it, all you can do is secure your home and stay indoors until it departs.

Us islanders know when it’s coming. We recognize the signs. Every few years, an outsider comes to visit and laughs at the warnings. They think we’re all simpletons or in some sort of crazy cult. Once, a man came to visit and refused to take the proper precautions. He even boasted about how he was gonna leave the doors unlocked, acting all smug like he was proving how stupid we were.

Now the nurses wipe his ass and spoon-feed him three times a day.

It’s hard to get away from the island. And the people here don’t care for outsiders. As a girl, I dreamed of leaving—of seeing the world. But Dad got sick and Mom needed help, so I quit school. Next thing I knew, I was grown and married to another islander.

After a few years, I wanted a fresh start. Mom had a fit. “What, you’re just gonna up and leave? What’ll the neighbors think? Just suck it up. Things’ll get better soon. You’ll see.”

But things didn’t get better. They got worse. A lot worse. And when you live here, it’s hard to keep secrets. Step outside with a black eye or busted lip and you may as well telegraph it across the entire island.

And Mom’s no help. At all. “He’s out on the boat working hard all day. I’m sure he doesn’t mean it. Things’ll get better soon, just wait and see.”

Wait and see. Wait and see. I’m sicking of waiting and seeing. And I’m sick of my husband. And I’m sick of this fucking island.

I act like everything’s fine. Say a friendly hello to the faces that pass by. At the market, two women mention slime washing up onshore. I thank them for the heads up. Along the coast, a man points out rainbow-colored sparkles on the horizon. I nod.

The Boneless One will arrive soon.

Back home, my husband has already pulled down the storm shutters. It figures—the fishermen are always the first to know. I fetch a bottle of whiskey from the cellar and pour him a tall glass. Then another. And another. 

My mother lives alone, so I’ll stay with her tonight. When I tell my husband I’m leaving, he staggers towards the door and locks it behind me. Outside, the stench almost makes me wretch. 

There’s *just* enough time for a short detour on the way to my mother’s house. I make my way to the beach, take the padlock from the cellar door out of my handbag, and toss it in the ocean. By now, my loving husband will be far too drunk to notice it’s gone.

At sunrise, The Boneless One will depart. Then I’ll sail to the mainland and start a new life."

We’d been driving for some now when Layla looked over and said to tell me she wasn’t feeling too well. “I want to get out of the car, I think I’m gonna throw up.” Only one quick glance at her, and I could tell already she wasn’t going to be squirming about in her seat for much longer. It almost looked funny, her trying to remain conscious while summoning the mental fortitude to unbuckle her seatbelt. With one hand pressing on the steering wheel, I eased my foot on the accelerator, aiming for the shoulder of the highway just ahead. Before stopping the car, I checked the rear-view mirror for any oncoming traffic. You could barely catch the city lights behind us, and if you paid close enough attention, you could just about catch the hubbub from the bars and pubs down the road.

Pulling on the handbrake, I turned the emergency lights off and unbuckled my seatbelt with one click. “Real easy, isn’t it?” I couldn’t help but let slip a slight chuckle. She didn’t laugh. “Oh yes, real easy. Especially when you haven’t been drinking more than you should’ve.” Her body, unresponsive, could do nothing more than lay there, slumped over to one side against the passenger door. She looked beautiful in her stillness. Undisturbed by the world around her; almost, careless. I wanted her to remain this perfect forever, untouched by time. Only. By. Me. I would make her-

A knock at the window. 

“Your car broke down?” a voice interrupted. He hadn't seen her yet.

I rolled down the window, letting the arctic night air paint over my face with thick bristles. The stranger had his eyes locked on me, waiting for an answer. 

But then he looked at her. His eyes diverted for a second, and then she wasn’t only mine anymore. She was no longer perfect in that moment. She had been taken from me. No matter what I did, I could no longer preserve her, she would never return to that undisturbed placidity that I had made my own. No, she was useless now; no longer only mine. Never again, mine.

“Oh, you know how they are”, I said playfully, “once they reach the legal age, they start drinking away before they realize they’re too drunk. I just didn’t want this one to puke all over my dash.” Glazing past me, he told her, “We’ve all been there, little lady. At least you have your dad here with you to hold your hair back.” A heartfelt laugh followed, and I joined in.

And then he was gone, never having seen her face. 

Her face.

Her face had now become a distorted mess of flesh; drooling, dribbling. Nothing but a cruel reminder of her former self, now ruined. I could no longer save her. She was dead. All the elegance had been robbed of her body, having been stolen from me, now lost forever.

I left her body by the side of the road."

***You could near-see him, but for the light*** 

***If you’d be blinded by frost-bit shadows*** 

***Your dread might hear, still, through the night***

This road. It’s narrow. It’s bent. A sharp, sharp bend at the cemetery. Those gravestones have been there for two-hundred and some-odd years. 

When I was a kid, I was terrified to drive around that bend. When papa would round that sharp curve and the lights would shine over the old, weathered headstones--dulled and uneven pauper’s headstones carved in Low German--I would crouch and hide down in the footwell of the truck. 

And now I’ve been called back home, though it’s been years since I’ve returned to Lebanon. What a place, this old road. Where the old farmstead held, heart-kept in the hearth of our childhood, the happy secrets of my youth.

Hunting out back in the crick; riding the tractor along the modest fields behind mama’s fence. 

A message left on my phone: *come home, Andrausch*. *The whole family’s here, we have a surprise!*  Mama calls, I listen. 

Driving in, I saw the old bridge was closed. I had no choice but to pass the old cemetery. 

A grown man, I am still scared. 

***He hides in every nighttime bough***

***And slumbers ‘neath Time’s fallow field***

***Crops made dead ‘neath snow-bound plough***

***Shrivel, dead husks, then, to reveal:*** 

I turn off of Kleinfeltersville and onto Bosersunder Road. Before the turn, the air was completely still. Now that I’m on my home road, a wind howls brutally and batters my windows hard enough to shake them inside the door frame. 

Just as I could start to see the bended hill where the cemetery sat, the driver side window *dropped* in the door frame, making a loud *crack*. I looked down, finicking with the power-window; when the button didn’t work, I panicked. Then, a strong beam of light. Another car--highbeams on!--was coming straight for me just as it whipped past the blind-spot beyond the graves. 

*A collision!*

But I whipped the steering wheel all the way to the right, skidded out of the way of the oncoming car. The sound of the wind howling was now deafening, accompanied by the shocking sound of tires exploding. My car did a full 360 and crashed into the cemetery gates. 

I got out of the car and looked down the road where I’d come from, ready to scream at the driver who’d run me off. But there was no car. *That’s impossible… I heard the other car crash*, I thought. 

Unnerved, I opened my cell phone and went to my call log--the last half-dozen calls I’d made were to mama. Maybe she could send Jim down the road to pick me up. But there *was* no call log. And I remembered: mama died years ago. 

Why was I here?

My friend wants me to donate half my brain to him because he has no brain inside his skull but I don't want to donate half my brain to him. I am being made to feel bad about myself because I don't want to donate half my brain to my friend. He has never had the pleasure of feeling a headache or even great feelings of the mind when taking hallucinating drugs. What's even worse is that my friend is constantly donating his organs to other people, for most of them to only give his organs back to him. 

He once donated his heart to an individual who needed a heart, but when that individual found out that my friend didn't have a heart anymore he became so creeped out. This individual wanted to make my friend less creepy by giving his donated heart back to my friend, even though he knew death will the be the end of him. My friend was destraught when he got his heart back. 

My friend kept on nagging me to be a good friend and to give half my brain to him but I kept on declining. My friend felt disappointed by me as I won't allow him to have half my brain where he would now be able to think and wonder a little when he is alone. He also blamed me for not allowing him to experience dreaming because I won't give him half my brain. He was being much more crueler to me that day because someone whom my friend donated both his lungs to, felt creeped out by him for not having any lungs anymore and so this other person donated the lungs back to my friend, which made my friend feel even worse. 

I am not the type of person to share a lot, so to even ask me to donate half my brain is a definite no no. At times my friend would calm down and try to speak to me like a friend should, but I still decline on giving him half my brain to him. I guess he is only in a good mood because someone didn't return any of his organs that he had donated. Like the 4 people who accepted to take 4 of his livers because he had 6 livers and they all decided to make my friend less creepy by taking 4 of his livers so he only has 2 livers which would make him normal. 

My friend recently was shouting at me to donate half my brain to him, because he wants the ability to think for once but I'm not going to give him half my brain. "

Embers glowed against the snow-white of the field.  Anya stood hand in hand with her tribe.  Singing songs and reveling in the longest night of the year.  

The men hunted in winter and had caught a great boar for the feast.  They served bread and sweetmeats. Mead and ale flowed from kegs on long tables.  The night was full of revelry and song, of feasting and lovemaking into the frosty night.

The last harvest gathered.  Tomorrow they would return to their longhouses and wait until the muddy thaws of spring came.  Locked away for months, living on dried meat and dried vegetables, and whatever grain they had stored away for the long months ahead.

Not all the tribe would make it through.  The snows and ice were harsh, and sometimes there was not enough food to last.  Sometimes huntsmen would not return home from the icy depths of air and darkness.  

Between songs, they heard shrieks and howls in the long night.  The air outside the village grew more frigged, calling deep winter to come.  This fire, built from wood they all gathered, would hold the beast at bay.   

Tonight they feasted and sang, holding onto the light when the black of night threatened to take them.   The bonfire burned high into the night sky, providing warmth and light.  

Past the village into the night, eyes glowed in the inky darkness, waiting for the wind to hide their howls.  Knowing that they too had to feed through winter."

THE KNOCK KNOCK GAME

It is called the knock-knock game, all you need is an empty room to play it you will knock two times… wait for it and hear aloud knock from the other side, whatever you do, DO NOT enter the room.

The room will be empty, but SOMETHING will be in there, is it a demon? The devil himself or god, an eldritch abomination?

No one really knows.

Maybe its better to not know.

I remembered playing it as a kid at my friend Thomas, house me him and Tobias a fat and a bit slow kid that Thomas used to bully a lot, but still hang around because Tobias parents were rich, so he had lots of cool games for Nintendo NES and SEGA Mega drive, even the mega-cd and 32x addons.

I started to like Tobias more then Thomas, he was always making racist jokes and saying mean things about everybody. But we had agreed to come over to his house to play a game he had learned from a book called the Necronomicon that his dad supposedly had a copy of.

This was of course NOT, the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul-Alhazared written in blood and made of human flesh, but a hardback version, still it contained things like how to summon demons and how to raise the dead with necromancy… or it did to Thomas anyway, he was a bit of a compulsive liar.

His parents were not home, so it was only us 3 boys in the house, we knocked on Thomas bedroom door, and waited for it.

\- Nothing is happening, Tobias said while munching on a chocolate bar, he really was a sweet tooth and always eating sweets and drinking cans of soda pops.

And then…

BANG. 

A loud sound from inside of Thomas room like someone was really mad and punched the door from the inside.

A was scared as fuck, almost pissed my pants, and careful snuck to the door, and peeped through the keyhole.

Inside it was still empty.

\-I want to go inside! Tobias dropped his chocolate bar on the floor and me and Thomas had to hold him by his arms, so he did not do anything stupid.

\- Stop, you fat and stupid pig, you will get yourself killed. Thomas shouted at him, a bit loud.

Tobias started crying.

\- I will go first. Thomas did not seem to care and knocked two times.

A knock was heard from the other room.

\- Are you a man or a woman? Thomas asked.

Two knocks signaling no heard from the other side.

\- Are you a demon or angel? I asked it.

Two knocks, no again.

\- Is it safe if we come inside? Thomas asked

Two loud banging sounds. No again but it seemed angry this time.

\- Maybe we should stop? I suggested.

\- No keep going you pussy! Thomas commanded.

Tobias was still crying, he seemed to get more and more afraid. I could not blame him really.

\- Are you getting mad? I asked it.

One loud bang. It was getting, real mad.

\-Are my parents alive? Thomas asked it.

HA HA HA. Evil laughter from the other side. Followed by two knocks.

\-Tobias knocked and asked. Can you speak?

\-Yes. It answered in a voice so creepy both me and Thomas fell to the floor.

We were frozen with fear, but Tobias was not, he knocked again.

\-Do you have candy? He asked naively.

\-Yes, child come inside.

I was trying to speak, but I could not get a word out. In what seemed like slow-mo I could see the fat kid turning the door handle ready to go inside.

I was ready to go up and stop him, but Thomas held me down, Tobias went inside the empty room and the door slammed shut.

I rushed up, but Thomas held me back.

\-Don’t be stupid! The fat kid is gone, but you are still here, no one can enter the room for another 24 hours. It got my parents and him it will be satisfied. 

I peeked through the peephole, and the room was empty, I called Tobias name but no answer.

Thomas knocked and asked if it enjoyed the fat boy as a sacrifice.

\-Yes. The voice answered creepily.

I just looked my former friend in the eye and left the house of evil to never return.

This was years ago… I am now grown up and moved to another city. Living in a small one-bedroom apartment, I decided to summon the thing again. I knocked on the door to the bathroom that’s the only room where it could appear.

I had bottles ready to piss in for 24 hours, and I would make sure no one would enter the bathroom.

I knocked on the bathroom door two times and it knocked back to signal its presence…

But the knock was NOT from the bathroom, it was coming from the front door to my apartment. I looked out and there was no one there."

A liquid, maybe water or blood,

dripping from my ceiling to flood,

He lay in his crib with a chubby fist shoved in his mouth, staring up at me as I watched over him. I spun his mobile, listened to the sound of his gurgling laughter. He was quite the kid, never failing to be amused by the slightest entertainment. 

I was made for Calvin. To be specific, he made me for himself. I personally wouldn’t have given myself pink fluffy fur, but hey, if that’s what the kid likes... I really don’t mind it. I love the little guy. Sure, I’m not keen on being the size of a cat, but when his only knowledge is limited to cardboard books, who can blame him?

He calls me Mister Beep. Of course, before his teeth grew in, he resorted to calling me “*Eeeeeeeep!*”, but I always knew what he meant. We read books together, watched cartoons, used couch cushions to jump across imaginary lava. You know, standard procedure. 

Cal was around six years old when he started having nightmares. Monsters under his bed, in the closet, yadda yadda. I do my job, though, and I’m dang good at it. I made myself look as scary as a pink cat can be, and protected him as best I could. Those closet goblins never stood a chance. 

You see, I always did the best I could. When I heard a pounding noise on his door, I let him bury his face in my fur. I tried so hard to drown out the screaming. But when you’re imaginary, there’s not much you can do. 

I just wish he imagined me being a lot stronger."

The man stood near me, but six feet away.

Smartly dressed in an old-school blue pinstriped suit with a blood red tie, he had a face that was quite angular, yet smooth as silk. Despite the silver hair peeking from beneath his fedora, he appeared neither old nor young. Not short, but not tall. Not pale, and not tan.

He wasn’t anything, really. He just…was.

   
 

Raising my voice a bit to be heard at this distance, I replied.

“Yeah, it’s a pretty strange feeling. One day you’re in close contact and the next… everyone has scattered.”

   
 

His voice was smooth and without flaw, like the manufactured accent of a fairy tale narrator. 

*“Yes. But…is this not where we’ve been headed for years?* 

*“The telegraph. Telephone. Radio. Television. Personal computer. Smart devices. Under the guise of extending our reach to the entire world, each has pulled us farther and further apart.*

*“And now here we are. DISTANT…because of a bat…because of a bug…because one doesn’t like the dry skin associated with hand-washing and is so obsessed with her face that she just can’t stop touching it…just to make sure she’s still there…still wanted…still important to them.”*

   
 

I removed my hand from my face.

   
 

*“And now humanity cannot be together. SHOULD NOT be together. From the very first time two personalities found themselves unable to coexist, distancing has been the goal.* 

*“Now people WANT to be together again?* 

*“And the masks? They WORK. Everyone continues to argue about the science when they’re missing the point. WEARING IT is a reminder to keep your distance…to watch out for each other.*

*“But you didn’t wear it, and you just HAD to have the family visit for Thanksgiving. You HAD to see everyone. God forbid they miss out on your famous sweet potato casserole, right?* 

*“God forbid you risk becoming irrelevant.”*

   
 

Every shred of disagreement was saturated by the pulse of his words. It was quite apparent that he spoke the truth. His truth, at least...and it penetrated my porous soul. 

   
 

*“Their blood is on your hands.”*

   
 

He was still six feet from me, but a mask didn’t adorn his face. I couldn’t transmit the illness to him anyway. It had been weeks since I’d shown symptoms. 

I had hidden them well at the time, though.

   
 

I knew he was here for me from the moment he’d walked up, leaving no footprints in the grass as he made his way to the location engraved next to my name on the marble wall in the ornate, reverent lobby. And I understood why he came.

His eyes excited but nervous, hers straight terrified. “Your the craziest man I’ve ever met, your heads screwed on but it’s on its last damn threads.” That made him smile. “Never could someone think life would turn out like this,” he said calmly, “Proved them wrong.” That was followed by a kiss. He spoke softly, “I love you,” and while what felt like looking right into her soul he took the gun out of his pocket, put it to his temple and fired.

""I am-"" 

How strange. 

The name faded from the back of my mind, springing off my tongue like a ball from a cannon.

The skin feels so tight around my body, and so loose around my face. I poked at my eyes.

They were shrunken in, tiny orbs in vast sockets. 

I reached to loosen the flesh on my arm but it held on so tight.

I tore the soft substance from my bone, only it wasn't.

My head hurt so badly.

The skin on my legs tore just as easily. The man looked scared.

Was he afraid of me?

My head pounded.

He started to run.

That which surrounded by body slid off cleanly.

Why did my head hurt so much?

He pounded on the door, screaming.

I went to comfort him.

The mask was the easiest to remove, I watched as the baggy face dropped from my head.

The face was horrifying. 

This man didn't look much less strange.

My headache stopped as the clicking began.

I should help him.

He was scared of himself.

Most of the time, I’m at work, so I simply silence my phone or deny the calls. As a millenial, I hate answering the phone, at all, but on my days off I absolutely LOVE getting these spam calls, because I can mess with the caller. 


“Has this ever worked? On anyone?” I ask sometimes.


“I only own a horse and buggy, can’t afford a car. Can you still sell me a warranty?” Stories I make up on the spot, always the most fun. 


“So when you visit family on holidays, what do you tell them you do?” Every now and then they turn into personal insults, especially when they call when I’m still in bed.   


Sometimes I just hold my throat and screech until they hang up. 


Spite motivates me here. I will wait on hold for fifteen minutes just for the chance to fuck with these people, and I don’t feel bad. Their job is literally to scam hardworking people out of money, I don’t have any moral qualms about giving them a hard time.  


I got a call on the way to work from them, “Spam Risk” showing up on my caller ID. I accepted the call, listening to the hold music through my bluetooth. 


Finally I got to a person. “Hi, this is Ben from Car-Go! Can I get your vehicle year and model?” The loser asked, his voice nasally and weak. 


“Yeah, I’ve got a nicer car than you do, because I have skills and work for a living. You’ve probably got a rental that you use on weekdays to get back and forth to your scam artist job.” 


“Do you think yourself funny, Matthew?” His voice asked, ice cold. “I was laid off and forced into this job, how would you feel if you were just as helpless?”


I groaned. The sympathy card was new, but not unexpected. “You’re scamming people to help yourself. You’re a parasite, and you make me sick.” 


He chucked, so unlike the whiny kid that had answered. “I’ll be seeing you very soon, Matthew. Unless you want to give me your vehicle information here and now.”


I refused, swore at him a little more, then hung up. It left me unnerved all day. My phone kept buzzing from spam numbers, to the point where I had to put in on silent just to avoid the annoyance. 


After work, I slumped into my car, exhausted. I start it up, letting it run for a little before putting it in gear. I feel a little sting at my neck, startled that a bug got in my car; it’s December, after all.


Suddenly my hands slump down, and I found I couldn’t move my body. A small shape and dark voice rose up in the backseat. 


“This is Ben from Car-Go! We’ve been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.”  "

“She won’t speak. It’s tough when no one else understands what you’re going through.” The nurse was frowning.

I breathed out a small sigh. “That’s why I’m here. Thank you.”

Inside the room, a little girl was wrapped in a blanket. She looked so small and dainty. I winced lightly when I saw the purple and black bruising around her left eye. Her cheeks were sunken in, and her pale lips were cracked. 

“Sweetie?” I took a few steps inside, but I faltered when she seemed to cower into her blanket. “I’m Detective Hirsch. Can I ask you a couple questions?”

Silence.

“I know all these people have tried to talk to you, and they think they know what’s happening to you. But they don’t.” I braved another couple steps forward. The girl didn’t seem as nervous, so I went on. “I do. I went through exactly the same thing. I get it. I know how hard it can be.”

I remembered being in her position. Doctors and cops keep trying to talk to you and check on you and won’t give you a moment of peace. You try to forget the trauma, but everyone else wants to rehash it. It’s exhausting.

“I was eight when he got me. And I was ten when they found me. It took a long time for me to finally talk to anybody. By that time, he had already taken another kid. Can you tell me something about this guy?”

“You’ve always wanted to be a cop, haven’t you?” Her tiny voice was quivering ever so slightly. 

I nodded, smiling. “Yes, ma’am. I’ve always wanted to help people.”

“You’ve helped a lot of kids.”

My eyebrows knit together in confusion. “Yes, I have.”

“They were all just like you. Kidnapped by a bad man. Hurt. Almost shot. Found. Hospitalized. Is that right?”

“Right. How do you know this?” 

“How many kids did he take? Your bad man? Was it ten, twelve? How many kids have you helped now?”

My breath was coming out ragged. What was happening? “Did the bad man try to shoot you, sweetheart?”

“Sorta. He didn’t *try*. He shot me. He shot you.”

Terror froze me in place. “What?”

“He shot you. The bad man. You wanted to help people. Because of you, every kid was safe. Because of you, the police found him.”

I tried to take a few stabilizing breaths. I looked out the glass door and saw the two nurses talking outside. Wait. Wasn’t I talking to that nurse before? No. I remembered wrong. I stood there and listened. I wasn’t talking. No one could hear me. No one could see me.

I turned back to the little girl, my eyes wide. “What’s your name?”

She smiled so big and said, “I’m Noelle Hirsch. And I’m going to be a cop when I grow up.”"

Marie sat in her chair, holding a glass of wine, staring at the TV, but barely watched.

John was in his reading chair at the other end of the room. The book wasn’t bad but wasn’t good either.

That was true for a lot of things these days.

That’s just life, he thought, turning the page.

“How’s the book?” Marie asked, slurring the last word.

He looked up, saw her tired eyes and her rosy face. He knew it wasn’t her first glass for the night, and it wouldn’t be the last.

“Not bad,” he answered, focusing on his book again.

“Ah well,” she mumbled.

For a while, all he heard were the voices on TV.

When Marie spoke again, there was an edge to her voice, and, he noticed, a slight shaking.

“How long do you think this will continue? How long-“

“Why don’t you just watch your show and drink your wine, Marie?”

“I’m just-“

“Nothing we can do about it, can we?”

He heard her empty the glass, followed by her pushing herself to her feet. She tottered through the room on her way to the kitchen for yet another refill. When she returned, she came to a stop in front of him.

He put down the book and looked up at her. Her face was filled with anger, sadness, but most of all reproach.

“How can you just-?”

She broke up when laughter reached their ears, laughter from down the hall, from their daughter’s room.

Their eyes met. For a moment Marie didn’t move before she stumbled back to her chair as if struck. The glass of wine was shaking in her hand, sending a spray of red droplets to the carpet below. They weren’t even noticeable among the rest.

John watched as she sunk deeper and deeper into the cushion before she emptied the glass in a single, greedy gulp.

Outside, the sound of toys and play got louder. John knew them all; the bouncing of the ball, the shrill tweet of the whistle, the wooden blocks being stacked upon one another.

Marie didn’t look up, didn’t say a thing. Instead, her hand clutched onto the empty glass and John could already see it bursting.

“Marie,” he started, but she cut him off instantly. Her head jerked towards him, her eyes wide and half-crazy.

“Make her stop, John, please, make her stop!” she screamed at him before she sunk back, shivering and weeping.

The glass fell from her hand, clattered to the floor, and added yet another tiny red splotch to the mess on the carpet.

John didn’t say a word, didn’t do a thing. Instead, he turned to the next page of the book.

And as he focused on the words in front of him, he shut it all out. The sound of the TV, his wife’s pleas and cries, and the giggling from down the hall.

For their daughter had died a year ago."

They disappear shortly after. It’s been going on for the last three to four years by now.

Doctors I’ve been to have yet to find anything out of the norm. 

To add to the issue, sometimes I’ll even see faint traces of the words from the article I read on my phone. 

I’ve scoured through all sorts of forums in an attempt to find someone else with the condition as me. A few lucky breaks were made when I eventually did find someone else. However, the thread was very dated and the responses to the original post weren’t really of use. 

I’m not the type to seek help in this sort of fashion, but the issue recently spiked my concern once more. 

Nothing of the ordinary was happening as I was just spending the night home again and was browsing around the internet. Once again, I’d gotten myself stuck in a Wikipedia rabbit hole when I decided to take a break and put my phone down. As per usual, I saw the lines across my vision and even some words from the last paragraph I read. Curious, I decided to focus on the words I saw. 

But the words weren’t what I read from the article. 

I was reading an article on some random country and the words, ‘Take caution’ aren’t the type of things usually seen in that sort of context. Brushing it off, I continued on with my night. The words would eventually fade away, but they lingered longer than how things would go other times. I brushed it off.

Then it happened again.

Later that night, I was reading about another country when the words, ‘Get out’ appeared in my view. The words wouldn’t fade from my vision Thoroughly paranoid, I flicked on all the lights and did a deep search through my home. Nothing was found, I mean what was I expecting?

My doorbell then shrieked, sending me to jump. After a frantic run to grab my phone and check my security camera app, only to realize that a package I’d ordered had been delivered. 

Stepping out to fetch it, the words finally faded. Nerves calmed, I went back inside. But then the phrase, ‘Get out’ reappeared once my foot crossed back inside my home. 

Everything is closed at this hour and I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m standing outside my apartment and I believe something is rumbling in there. The idea of the words and that sound being connected seems high, but it’s just a mere coincidence, right?"

Clearly, he is a deranged man who cares nothing for climate change, even though it is melting his own home and factory where his slave labor mass produces products to give away for free. Welcome this man into your homes and tell your children to worship him! 

SATAN!

Whoops...

I mean, SANTA!

But let us not forget the real horror story in this nightmare of festivities...CREDIT CARD BILLS IN JANUARY!

_______________________

##RULES AND REGS##

* Stories must be ""Holiday"" themed. This is clearly limited to the December holidays.

* Stories must be submitted under a new throwaway account. 

* Contest entries must be tagged with [The Holidays 2020]. No-tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are seen, with the capitalization of the ""T"" in The and the ""H"" in Holidays and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results. For example, during our /r/SleepSpell competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged precisely as the search I listed. So please, please, please, use the tag exactly as it is listed.

* All entries must adhere to the standard subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. Once every 24 hours, as per usual. 

* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate. They may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions!

* The story with the highest amount of upvotes wins the contest and prizes. The next four highest upvoted stories will receive honorable mentions in the winner's circle. There is no prize for honorable mentions. Unfortunately, I am not a rich man and cannot provide rewards to all. 

* If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement, and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the authors' winners circle. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times, but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests have had up to 7+ authors included in the winner's circle due to ties and multiple placements.

It could have been a Monday or a Tuesday or any day in the week. I couldn’t say. 

I woke up with this mind numbing pain in my right big toe. It felt like someone was scraping a dull butter knife up and down my nail bed. I flung the covers aside and almost died of a heart attack when I saw what greeted me at the end of my foot. My toe had grown to the size of a small balloon; the colour a mixture of plum and blood red. The skin was wound so tight and it glistened. In the middle, where my nail should have been, was an oozing mass of tumorous skin. 

Before I could do anything, the lump shifted and morphed to reveal a row of sharp little teeth. They were like little knives, jagged edged and the colour of a bronze coin. Rotting and filthy. I blinked a few times, making sure this was actually real. Was I dreaming? It was a possibility that this was a very surreal, very vivid, *very* fucked up dream. But when I felt the teeth sink into my skin, I knew that it was real - the pain I felt surge through my body was not the result of a hallucination. It chewed and crunched until I no longer had any toes; the strange thing was, there was absolutely no blood. 

I could do nothing to stop it. 

By the end of that week, my right leg was gone. Devoured entirely by my living, monstrous toe. I watched as it continued to guzzle on my flesh; perpetually drooling blood and saliva. Sucking and chewing on my muscle tissue like peperami. I tried to cut it off to no avail; each morning, it would come back, more venomous than ever. 

As the weeks passed and I could no longer get out of bed; I was forced to lay in my own piss and shit and watch helplessly as it consumed my genitals, my torso and both of my arms. I pleaded with it. It would never answer me. Just continued to munch, crunch and chew. 

When I woke up one morning, I realised there was nothing left; I was nothing but a head and the toe was inches from my teary eyes. That’s when I noticed something different. It opened it’s grotesque mouth and I could see a fathomless, black hole but at the bottom, I saw a light. Like a torch falling down a well; faint but vivid. 

As the light got closer, I saw the faces of thousands of others that the toe had consumed, shining brightly like stars on a clear summer night. Then my toe smiled. 

*You are going to love it here.* 

Then the toe swallowed what was left of me and I fell into the abyss."
khkyhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/khkyhx/the_host/,The Host,18,1,1608569017.0,"«Auch!»

A sudden pain stings my left hip: it's like a hot needle on the soft tissue.

«Is everything okay, Jan?»  
I rise from my cubicle in the open space: a tall, bearded man in a blue suit is looking at me.I smile and nod, flapping right hand over the plastic wall.  
«Sure Sven. Just a colic»  
Sven smiles, he puts his hands on the pockets and turn his head to the door on the left.  
«Let's have a tea at the machine. It helps&#x2013;»  
«*That* tea? Seriously?»  
Sven looks at me, offended.  
«I'm from Norway! I perfectly know these things»  

I sigh, I make a face while exiting the cubicle and I move to my manager. He's taller than me of a full head and I am not average high. Definitely, Sven is a true descendant of vikings.

He put his key on the coffee machine and pushes a button with a red cup. I bow my eyebrow while the black box as high as Sven begins buzzing.

«Did they change the machine?»  
Sven shrouds.  
«Probably. I don't manage the furniture. Here!» he says, and gives me the plastic glass with a warm, orange liquid, smelling of lemon and tea.

I smile and sip from the glass.  
Sven coughs.  
«So? How's going with the vaccine compatibility?»  
I nod looking at the cup: the taste is better than usual!  
«It's good. The viral messenger is carrying correctly the modified RNA»

Sven presses another button and the machine buzzes again.  
«So we can proceed?»  
I look at him and shake my head.  
«Not yet. Too early. I saw unexpected replications on hamsters tissue&#x2013;»  
«Ah!»  
I smile to him and blink my eye.  
«Yes, but it should not be a problem!»  
Sven seems relieved and we move back to the office.

⁂

I moan and I bend in two, my arms moves to the left hip.  
The pain didn't passed after the tea and now is like an iron rod piercing by body.  

Around me, my colleagues look from the plastic walls of the cubicle. I have short breath and I sweat.

I stand up.  
«S&#x2026; sorry!» I whisper.  
I run to the door, I trespass it and I found myself in a white corridor. I continue my run made of small jumps, limping for the pain, until I reach a door with a stylized white man on a blue background.

I turn, I close the door in the room big few steps with a toilette in front of me and a sink on the right.  
Maybe the new tea made the colic worst?

I open my belt, I rise the shirt over the jacket and I turn to the mirror over the sink.  
I scream.  
A small face, big as a a doll, emerges from my hip and looks at me, terrified.  
«Replication&#x2013;» I said.  
«&#x2026;on hamster tissue», completes the little face."

khj6by,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/khj6by/the_shed/,The Shed,60,11,1608563376.0,"The shed is 16-foot-by-16-foot, with dark wooden slats for sides, its two windows boarded. It sits crookedly at the back of our house, where an old woodlands leans over the fence, its twisted branches scratching the shed roof in the wind.

My grandad built it. Shot animals in the woods and dragged them into the shed where he'd skin and carve them and present them for dinner. But grandad died when I was small and my dad inherited the house and shed. I rarely ventured into the woods, and never, ever into the shed. I couldn't. Each time I neared my heart inflated to a basketball ready to explode.

I'd just turned thirteen the day it ate them.

It started with Dad. ""I'm going out to the shed,"" he'd said, bag of cleaning supplies in hand. ""About time we did something with it.""

It had still been daytime. Nothing bad could happen in day time.

And yet...

""Mom,"" I said, tugging her sleeve. ""Dad went to the shed ages ago and he's not come back. I'm worried something bad's happened.""

Going to Mom instead of checking myself felt pathetic. I'd turned a teenager that day, but was still a cowardly child at heart.

A few minutes later, Mom bravely went to check. I watched her enter the single swinging door from the kitchen window. She'd been baking before she went, and a sweet smell in the room seemed at perverse odds with the sickness of the shed outside.

I waited.

And waited.

Mom didn't come out.

Could I call the police? Say my mom had been in the shed for thirty minutes but that it felt like three days, so that had to count as missing, right?

A knock on the front door echoed through the house.

I opened it hoping for someone, anyone, that might help.

My friends Alex and Jo stood on the doorstep, their bikes by their side. Just been in the area and figured they'd come see what I was up to.

I told them about the shed.

They looked at each other wide-eyed as I explained. The animals slaughtered inside of it. My parents one by one going into it.

""We'll help,"" said Alex. ""Just calm down. Okay?""

I followed them into the back garden, and even walked most of the way to the shed with them -- although I felt its sickly revulsion at me approaching.

I watched them enter. Heard the door creak shut behind them.

Another twenty minutes passed as I shivered in the cold, praying.

I don't know if the guts, or stupidity, came from having lost everything important to me--but I found myself walking towards the shed. Drawn to it like fate, ready for a final confrontation.

With a deep breath, I opened the door.

Balloons rocked into me and the sweet smell of cake was almost overwhelming. They shouted at me in unison."

His flesh has now become the one, the carrier of midnight sun.

""We've got you on tape, there is no denying it. The evidence points right at ya, and you yourself confessed, ""supposedly while asleep."" as impossible as that sounds. We went to your backyard, and dug up at the spot you told us to, and sure enough, we find the murder weapon, and the corpse, all the while we find matching fingerprints on the corpse, and the weapon. What is your defense?""

""I've got nothing to say. I suppose that.. that *thing* confessing on camera spoke truthfully.""

""Is that really so? Maybe, maybe it was you, just your subconscious mind, motivated by the sheer amount of your guilt, whispering to your body while the murdered was away dreaming, to do the right thing? Or maybe its just you sick fuck trying to pledge to insanity, eh?""

"" I swear i'm innocent, i really do!""

""The judge will decide that, you murderous bastard.""

khfv2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/khfv2z/i_know_that_i_am_attractive/,I know that I am attractive,33,9,1608551201.0,"I know that I am attractive and as shallow and selfish that sounds it is the truth. You may think being attractive is great but to me it is hell. Right now most of you are scoffing at me in disgust for that comment but even attractive people have struggles in daily life just like everyone else. Life always gives complications to everyone no matter who they are. 

I will give a few examples, a couple of months ago as I was walking down the street when suddenly something started dragging a woman towards me. It was the magnetic field of my attractiveness and she became stuck to my body. She was screaming and she was in pain, and as I tried to force her off of me a load of her skin on her face came off. I could literally see the skull in her head and she was dead within seconds. Blood was everywhere. 

Another time was when I was sitting outside in the garden on a hot summers day when all of a sudden the magnetic field of my attractiveness, dragged a man through the fences and was stuck to my body. He was in pain and when I pulled him off, unfortunately his body only came off. His head was still stuck on my body and I had to take the head off piece by piece. It was disgusting with blood and human matter everywhere. I also had to buy a new fence. 

I tend to stay away from people and do my best to stay inside. I remember once when I had multiple people that were dragged by the invisible force of my attractiveness. Getting them off me was super hard work as they were all stuck on me. Human matter was everywhere and peeling off human skin off me was not nice. 

Recently though I think I might be finally losing my attractiveness. I have figured this out because less people are being dragged by the magnetic field of my attractiveness and less people are being stuck on me. Also when they are stuck it's easier to get them off without their skin or limb still on me. 

Life will get easier. "

    ""I would only want to be killed by you, so I suppose it wouldn't be all bad."" 

    ""Shut up,"" Ezekial says in return.

    ""Aha! And we're here."" Xavier shouts a little too loudly.

    And he's right. Right below me, my head sagging down and the permanent black drawn smile and eyes on my face, the old brown flannel that matches the old brown hat and dirty blue jeans. Below me, they gawk.

    ""Are you ready to see if the tales are true?""

    ""No."" 

    ""Perfect, let's go."" 

    The two get closer, Ezekial treading lightly. Scared as he should be. One boy gets on my right side. One boy gets on the other. They face one another, and they clasp hands.

    ""Do you remember the words?"" I can't tell who speaks, I'm too excited. I believe a yes is said, but I can't quite tell.

Now, the moon decides to show itself. A beacon, but for what?

    ""Sticks and straw, a wondrous caw, I call to the ground, to feel a pound, I call one to walk, to stalk, to dine, to end, those of ourselves.""

       Below me, the words are repeated. Once. Twice. Three times. The wind is roaring, and they write it off as pure coincidence. Of course they do. The straw blossoms at their heart, traveling up their throats first, to silence their screams. Straw becomes red as it pokes through the skin, pools of blood drop to the ground and sizzles in the cool air. Sewing their mouth shut with the tiniest thread, the field travels to their eyes. Tearing pieces of clothing and sealing their fate, two new scarecrows are made for the field. 

    I land on my feet, my jeans bending to my movements. My lace button up I had worn that dreadful night was open, goosebumps becoming a new field, but now on my skin. The brown jacket I bought a size too small by accident was just as tight as it was before, but it didn't bother me. 

    The corn stalks lift Xavier from his wrists, they tighten so hard his skin rubs raw. He is pulled up into the air, head hanging low, and is placed on the post. I hear the nails go through his skin, more flesh tearing with a wet crunch. The last bit of life leaves Xavier's body in a muffled gasp that causes his head to rise. His face is frozen in a state of burned horror, like the sun had become his best friend. Straw protrudes from his mouth, more blood dripping from his eyes and drying instantly. Ezekial becomes one with the earth, sinking in a manner of seconds. I don't look back. I don't have time."
khds19,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/khds19/the_whisper/,The whisper,6,0,1608541788.0,"When I was studying at the university in Bangkok, Thailand, I was told a lot of scary, mysterious stories about something in the buildings around the university. I always ignore them because I don’t believe in ghosts or any unknown creatures haunting the students here. One day, my friend got a new story to tell me, the whisper at the pharmaceutical sciences faculty. As he was telling me how horrified was it, I just sat there in silence and nodded because, nah, what is the point of this story, I don’t see any benefits of it. 

But, this time, I regretted not believing him. 

Two days before my last examination, I was sitting alone in a canteen waiting for my girlfriend working on her project with her team. I remembered that it was about 10 pm and suddenly after the clock on the wall alarmed, there was a sound of women, old, hoarse voice, whispered near my ear “I’m so lonely”. I jumped, stood up and searched around to find the source of that old lady's voice, but, no one in sight. I reminded the story that my friend has told me, and yes, I just sat here in a canteen of the faculty of pharmaceutical sciences. Although I didn’t believe what just happened, my body was shivering and I could hear my heart pounding. 

I jumped again to the ringing of my phone, it was a text from my girlfriend, telling me to meet her at the front door of the laboratory building. I swiftly gathered my stuff and ran to an exit of the canteen. “This is not true, it should be just wind coming through windows” I was thinking to myself while exiting the canteen. As I closed the door and turned back, the voice to remember forever came to my ears..

“I know you hear me”"
khdnf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/khdnf0/identical/,Identical,51,1,1608541200.0,"I was looking for a good family. That’s why I came to yours. I watched your husband cook to your cravings. I was there when you looked at his baked macaroni and cheese like a breadcrumb mirage and him like your hero. I watched you decorate the nursery together. I dropped down on a moonbeam and saw you had two, one for me and one for you.

When you wake up tomorrow, the changeling will to be your new favorite. You won’t know why, but I can see that she’s marked by an inhuman womb. Your daughter will spend countless hours before the mirror wondering why she’s not as pretty as her twin. She’ll eventually come to the conclusion that, while her sister glows, something inside of her is dim, broken. This is only one of the gifts of the good folk.

My daughter will fill your home with the music of a better world. She’ll play any instrument you put in front of her. Your little angel will even play the harp, when she’s old enough to get her arms around one. But that’s not why I gave her to you. Her fingertips were shaped to pluck at heartstrings.

Your less-loved daughter will know that you love her less, and you’ll love her less for knowing. Your husband will notice. He’s fond of wounded animals; it’s why he married you. She’ll still be trying to win your affection long after your every word to her will have sharpened, and he, no one’s hero now, won’t leave you. I’d never place my daughter in a broken home.

After years of perfect grades and perfect hair, she’ll change back. Your daughter might escape puberty with some acne and upper-lip hair, but, one moonlit night, the mimic will come apart at the perforated seams of her strained-milk skin. She’ll look like me then, long and sleek with black hair. The bat-winged weasel before you will still call you mother, but she’ll know that she’s not home. You’ll beg her to take you with her, not to leave you in a world without her. Her filial piety will oblige you. Like a migrating butterfly, she’ll return to me. You don’t have words for what happens to humans here, but we’ll teach you ours, and your husband and daughter will finally be alone below the moon."

Look ma’ and daddy, they are always yelling at each other and stressed and ugh! It’s not like when I yell at Gage, because he’s playing with my toys. It’s a different kind of yell, sure it is.

There was this day when mom got back from her work and started saying stuff to daddy, he asked her to calm down but then he slapped her? I don’t understand.

And this other day when he was cooking and she threw some oil at him and he started screaming? Why?

I don’t do that to Gage. I hate when he plays with my stuff, but I can’t imagine hurting him! Or saying all that kind of stuff!

Gage and I don’t cry anymore. Because of the things they do to each other. I guess this is adult life? That’s why I don’t want to grow up!

But today is going to be a nice day. They are taking us to the beach. We only went once! Mom and daddy are smiling more today!

The sand is warm and good and cozy, soooo good! The sun, oh it feels good feeling its touch on my skin and my hair! Look at all these people, with their dogs and happy! The beach is amazing!

Daddy is even going to buy us some ice cream! Gage and I started following him towards the ‘sir of the ice cream’. We went ahead, ice cream! We asked vanilla, the sir asked money.

We called dad, of course. We yelled it. We looked behind us and see lots of peoples. Gage screamed for daddy another time.

She nodded and tried to still the shaking of her hands by squeezing her thighs.

He began the therapy, and as his voice lulled her into deepening calm, a feeling of warmth and relaxation radiated from her fingertips through the rest of her body. 

He pulled her deeper, her walls crumbled and she sat before him in a suggestible state. His smile was indulgent now- she was vulnerable. She was open to whatever he decided to put in her.

He rubbed his hands together and whispered past traumas that had never happened. He whispered scenes of violence and perversion. He whispered pain and he made her the victim she never was. He broke the trust she had with her family. 

Then he whispered thoughts of hopelessness. Despair. Weakness.

He whispered a fixation- revenge or escape. He whispered strength, he whispered the blade, the power of a sharp edge to cut out the pain and make things right. 

Then he lifted her back out of hypnosis, and she was dripping with tears. He ended the session and let her go forth with her grief and misery, back to the home where she was so loved.

He expected to see her in the news tomorrow."

  A giant timer just appeared in the sky. Bold, black lettering, as ominous as you can get. Not on a billboard or any type of sign, just a giant projection, hovering over our town like a deathly harbinger. 

  As you can imagine, it freaked everyone out. Traffic signals became suggestions as everyone rushed home to their loved ones. Cell towers shut down as thousands of people called their family and friends to say goodbye. There was no other information, besides the clock ticking, numbers slowly going down. 

**45:00**

It took fifteen minutes for the looting to start. Grocery stores are full of people hauling out carts of televisions, gaming consoles, and junk food. Imagine Black Friday but everything goes. I watch from my window as my neighbor, a devout vegan, starts up her grill, cooking enough bacon to feed a room full of lumberjacks. I’d be impressed if I wasn’t so afraid. 

**30:00**

All of the doors and windows are locked. My family huddles together in the living room, sharing stories from our childhoods, laughing and crying while we still have time left. We are immune to the chaos around us. 

**15:00**

The streets have gone silent. Everyone is gone or dead. My dog is asleep with her head on my lap, oblivious. My family has stopped talking. There is nothing left to say. 

**5:00**

We hold each other close, although we know we cannot protect each other. The end is near. We brace ourselves for what is coming. 

**02:00**

My dog licks my hand as I shake violently. She knows I am afraid, and she wants me to feel better. I rub her head and tell her I love her. 

**00:30**

We close our eyes, squeeze each other’s hands, and say “I love you” for the last time. 

**00:00**

We wait. We wait some more. Nothing feels different. My dad is the first to look outside, and he screams. We all come running. The timer is gone, replaced by a message.

She giggled as the floor beneath her gently rumbled, pressing her chin squarely into the carpet in front of the television. 

Her parents were fourth-generation farmers from Pennsylvania, so the network of choice was Fox. Caroline, at a tender seven years old, watched intently with imperfect comprehension. 

*Breaking News…*

Caroline huffed disappointedly. The story that was being covered, a miraculous tale of an election predicting cat, was just getting interesting. The screen began to glitch in and out, and Caroline could not hear anything. The power on the farm was oft to go out on occasion, so this did not trouble Caroline. 

The girl simply sighed, picked her doll up off the floor, and began towards the stairs. As she passed the window overlooking the countless rows of corn, she noticed that the sun had not yet set. What Caroline also saw, but did not make note of, was that there was a steady wind coming from the east that was quickly growing in strength. 

Caroline stopped at the top of the stairs and took in a deep breath. It was the middle of the summer, and the farm always produced bountiful clean air. At this moment, however, Caroline was finding it difficult to fill her lungs. 

Caroline’s room was the first room on the left at the top of the stairs. Caroline collapsed onto her bed. Her head was starting to hurt, and suddenly she was feeling very light-headed. 

*Bang!*

Caroline picked her head up from her pillow with a jolt. This time, the explosive crack seemed more akin to a shotgun shell being discharged rather than a natural occurrence. Whatever it was, the noise only added to the pain in Caroline’s head. 

Confused, the girl picked herself up and began walking down the hall towards her parents’ room. She peered through the hall window and saw that although the Sun had set, there seemed to be a luminous mist gathering in the night air. This is how she was able to “see” that the wind had grown strong enough to rip out whole corn plants, which were presently being beat against the house.

Scared, the girl stumbled into her parents’ room. The first thing she saw was her father on the floor next to the bed. She noticed there was red liquid pooling underneath him, with more coming out of his head. 

“*What is happening Mom?”*

Her mother, sitting on the opposite side of the bed, said nothing. Caroline noticed she was crying, and her father’s shotgun was resting underneath her chin. 

*Bang!*

Caroline watched as her mother rolled off the bed and onto the floor, the wall behind a macabre masterpiece. Her vision was starting to get lost in a red fog, but as she blinked away a mixture of tears and blood, she saw on the television:

*Nuclear bomb hits Philadelphia, be advised*"

“I’m exhausted.”

*“…Because you’ve been awake all night? Because of the dream?”*

“No, I was asleep all night. I tried to wake up, but I couldn’t. I’m exhausted because I was stuck in there.”

*“Why don’t you run me through the dream? And don’t just give me the pale bones of it, I need the meat, the emotion, how the dream makes you* feel*.”*

“Well I’m in my room.”

*“Yes.”*

“And I’m trying to sleep when I realize I’m being watched. I feel it in my skin first, his eyes, rolling over me like rodents. I turn and his face is pressed up against the window. He’s outside looking in. He’s got an old face, or maybe its not even his face, it seems to be slipping down, drooping – But it must be his face! There’s too much expression in it!”

*“Alisa. Breathe. Now, can you tell me what his expression is…*without *yelling.”*

“Of course. He’s grinning.”

*“I need more than that Alisa.”*

His face, it’s been wrinkled by decades of wind and rain and sun, but the way he grins, it’s almost like he’s a toddler. He reminds me of a nephew I once caught strangling a baby duck.”

*“You mean duckling.”*

“Fine…my nephew was strangling a *duckling*, was gripping it so hard his little knuckles turned white. He was grinning. Like he discovered he was God. It’s the same expression the man in my dream has. He looks at me like a duckling within his grasp.”

*“Do you confront the man?”*

“Not at first! No…first I need to get away. I try the door, it won’t open, so I pack myself in the closet like a coat, then I roll under the bed and try to bleed through the cracks in the floorboards and all the while a sensation follows that he can still see me, like he’s watching a pet squirming around in its cage. I give up and go to open the window.”

*“What does he say?”*

“He says I’m on the wrong side, then he gives me a small strip. I put it on my tongue and let it dissolve. He helps me climb out the window. I’m not sure when it happens, but the world changes. Everything is breathing. Every blade of grass vibrating, every grain of dirt buzzing like a universe, there’s a dead crow laying there amongst it all. The man takes my hands and shows me how to caress the bird, where to put pressure. It’s black wings soon flutter in my face! I give it a toss and it flies!”

*“He showed you how to bring the dead back to life?”*

“Isn’t that wonderful!”

*“Alisa…that’s not what happened.”*

“How would you know? It’s my dream.”

*“It may have seemed like one, but the drugs were just disrupting your view of reality. What you mistook for a crumpled, lifeless crow, was in fact still living. You killed it.”*

“No…What about the – “

It was coming up, rising through my esophagus, then my throat, and finally, through my mouth.

And I had no words to describe what happened. Well, I did, but they were all gone.

Hurling and hacking, I coughed up the things. Some were letters, some were words, some were phrases that made no sense. Some of them weren't even words. Glorps of gobbledegook that clung together in a mass of ""jshenswiakapa"".

But they were all in the alphabet, except for the bits that were periodically stuck in my colon.

They slithered around, toxic little strings that reeked of dusty books and ink. Looking at me with i's, like they asked something of me.

But I had nothing to say.

So they hunted along the ground. Little murals of ""hblaghse"" that looked for a target.

They found somebody eventually, an unlucky bloke who had no way of knowing what was coming.

He tried to dodge, but they cut him off at his every move. There was no way to read them, and his days were surely numbered.

They climbed up his trousers, then onto his shirt, and finally, into his mouth.

Forcing themselves down his throat, he choked, gasping and spluttering for air (which obliged, that was one of the words in the pile) as they bulged his throat with ""shecgdurd""s and ""Will Will Smith smith Will Smith? Yes, Will Smith will smith Will Smith""

His neck cracked, fissures of blood started to pop out through his neck, along with stray a's and lost o's.

And then it burst, his neck exploding with flesh chunks and blood and and's as piles of words flew everywhere, splattering the pavement with goo.

They crawled back over to his corpse, their fonts turning red as they dipped themselves in his blood, swimming in it, some of the garbles tried, but they couldn't get under the line.

They bunched up again, a conglomerateofwordsoncemore, and headed off, looking for their next victim."

“Shit, goddamn sun,” he cursed and went to pull the curtains.

This was his one free day this week, and he had the right to sleep for as long as he damn well pleased.

Squinting his eyes, he made it to the window. Why was it so damn bright? Wait a second, why were the street lights still on? Wasn’t it morning already?

As he stared outside, he noticed that the street was filled with people. There was a commotion outside. People were screaming, others laughing hysterically, and a few sat on the ground, utterly dumbfounded.

Yet, there was one thing they all had in common. They were all staring at the sky.

Shock washed over Jake. What the hell was going on? It had to be war. A bomb. An explosion. Why was everyone staring at the sky, though?

He threw open the window but had to take a step back as a gush of hot air hit his face. No, not just hot, it was scalding outside. How in the hell...? It’s the middle of December.

He leaned forward, putting his arms on the window frame, and pulled them back instantly, cursing in pain.

For a moment he rubbed his arms, then reached out again. There was no doubt, this was no illusion. The stone was hot, burning hot, as if the summer sun had shone on it for an entire day.

Fear washed over him, fear and confusion.

Outside people were still screaming, throwing themselves to the ground in despair, in terror, or in hysteric insanity.

Oh god, what the hell’s going on?

Even in this blazing heat, he started shivering. What if it’s a nuke? What if-?

He broke up when he could finally see the sky.

Above him, the sky was alight by an immeasurable amount of stars. It was nothing but a glistering sea of light and in its center a giant, blazing star.

His eyes grew wide, his mouth opened. For a moment he thought it was the Milky Way, that the stars were more visible tonight, that they were closer.

But then, he noticed that what he saw wasn’t merely the sky, not merely the stars, but some sort of entity.

Its head was the blazing, burning star, its body a terrible, endlessly twisting galaxy, and its arms comprised glittering space nebulae. 

And he laughed as he saw it, laughed at the surreal hilarity at the impossibility above.

In the far emptiness of space, none of that mattered. The entity didn’t waver, didn’t care, didn’t think.

Despair, terror, insanity, and even the existence of mankind were all but meaningless.

For it had descended for one thing and one thing alone:

To steal yet another world."

He speaks of only wicked things, of serpent fangs and insect stings. And though I do not understand, he always shows his red right hand.

“My son, my poor son Johnathan… went missing. Right on the night of Christmas! He went downstairs, probably to go rummaging through the presents under the tree, and then he was gone! He must have found the digital recording set, because I found it next to our Christmas tree, lying on the ground… I couldn't believe what I found recorded on that device, and I'm not sure you will either, but just please listen.”

The day before Christmas Eve of 1993, 12:00 p.m.

“Hellooo? Hellooo? Aww, sweet! It works! I thought my rubbish father was gonna get me rubbish presents like he always does, but this is awesome! He should be coming home from the store soon, so I’m gonna have to rewrap the gift box and put it under the tree.”

The day before Christmas Eve of 1993, 2:00 p.m.

“Hey, I’m thinking of making an audio diary for this thing full of cool things I did! Before vacation, I beat up a kid at school cause he was looking at me weird, and he didn’t even tell the teacher! Oh, that was great. That stupid boy. He thought he was better than me.”

The day before Christmas Eve of 1993, 8:00 p.m.

“Maybe I'm gonna leave this on during the night, and see how loud I snore. It annoys my dad when I snore, so I try to be loud. My father is gone too much to love me, but he gets lots of money being an Innkeeper, so I annoy him and he gives me stuff.”

Later that night on the recording, which ran for about an hour, recorded the sound of Johnathan's door creaking open. The sound of an unknown entity is heard.

“Jonathannn… you have been a bad boy…”

\*slam\*

Christmas Eve 1993, 8:00 a.m.

“Umm, somebody was recorded on this device while I was sleeping… I can’t tell dad either because he will know that I opened one of my presents… he will be made and make me do something like making a boondoggle bracelet as an apology, and I hate apologizing. I'm not going to use this thing again, and later tonight I will bring it downstairs.”

Christmas 1993, 1:00 a.m.

“My dad fell asleep, and I'm going to go put this recorder thing back in the box. Wait a second, what is that? What in god’s na…”

“You have been a bad boy”

“What? No. Stay away from me! Why do you have claws and horns? This isn’t funny! STAY AWAY!”

The audio is filled of Johnathan's screaming, then it goes silent.

After Johnathan's body was found in a tree, his father Nathaniel was convicted of first degree. The tape was used as evidence that his father went crazy from Johnathan's antics, and killed him with an undiscovered sharp object.

To this day, Nathaniel swears he didn’t do it, and this may be true, because in the wood, there was a mat of fur caught on a branch with Johnathan's blood on it."

I look around: in the garden on the left there's a red bicycle lying on the green grass. The sky is gray and is menacing rain.  
The green door with a golden door knocker opens and a blonde woman in a soft, white sweater appears.  
I took off my hat, exposing my bald head and I smile.  
«Mrs.Vratio?»  
She smiles too. A nervous smile.

«Is your husband at home? He sent me many&#x2013;»  
«He's not»

I shake my head.  
«I am sorry. I supposed Marko was a male name&#x2013;»
She turns to me.  
«It is. But my husband never wrote you. Especially about physics».

On the floor there's a red and yellow carpet where sits a boy focused on the cartoons on the television.  
Miss Vratio moves close to me.  
«He's Marko»  
I am flabbergasted: Marko Vratio is a seven years old boy.  
I clear my throat and I open my mouth, but the boy interrupts me, staying focused on the show.  
«I know you're here, professor Contreras. Welcome»  
I look at his mother, but she walks away immediately. The boy moves his head to watch her and assumes a sad expression. He looks at me.  
«I am sorry. She's too delicate for&#x2026; this»  
I move to Marko: his voice, his tone, his face are mature and familiar.  
«How you know those physics concepts, Marko?»  
Marko smiles, but it's a tired smile, something only a old man would be able to show with the same truthfulness.  
«You like Transformers too, Juan»  
I look at the television and back to Marko.  
«Yes, I do»  
«And dutch *olijebollen*»  
«Sure»  
«And you stole an apple at the market when you were eleven, to prove your friends you were cool»  
I nod and in a instant a freezing intuition flashes my brain.  
Marko notices my scared expression, nods and turns again to the television.  
«Stop the research on the space-time modulation. It would be... dangerous»  
I stand up and move out of the living room, I open the door and close it without saying anything, walking to my car on the other side of the street under a cold and heavy rain.  
I open the door of the car and I move my hands on my face, as to wake up.  
Marko had my same hair.  
But his eyes, looking carefully, were lighter, almost yellow.

The virus kept everyone afraid, and if they were fortunate enough to have a place to call home, they would stay there to avoid the plague. He could picture his old friends, his old family, sitting in their bunkers with their heads buried in the sand, waiting for the end times to pass. *Pathetic. Let them stay inside*, he thought happily, looking over the empty city streets. *The dead make for better company, anyway.*

On that notion, he stood up, sliding the strap of his duffel bag over his shoulder. Visiting hours were nearly over, and the sun was getting low. The moon wouldn’t be quite half full, and if the clouds above gave any indication, it would be a dark night.

It didn’t take long to find a target. The grave was fresh, the soil loose and easier to manage. Pushing his hand through the dirt, Seth smiled; it wasn’t even a day old. He removed the shovel from his duffel bag and began to dig.

Seth was right to believe that the night would be darkly lit, the moon nigh invisible in the clouds that obscured it. However, his belief that it would benefit *him* was mistaken. As he neared the surface of the coffin, a shadow cast over him, but he did not see it.

“Shouldn’t be here,” a voice whispered from above.

Seth slowed, but did not stop. “Am I under arrest?”

“Not a cop,” the voice answered.

“Work here?” Seth asked. The end of his shovel scraped against the coffin. He set it aside, brushing dirt away.

“No.”

An uncontrollable giggle escaped Seth’s lips. “Then you’re not meant to be here either,” he noted. The top half of the coffin was uncovered.

“Don’t open that,” the voice warned, but Seth didn’t care. In the stillness of that dark night, his heart was pounding with excitement.

He pulled the coffin’s upper half open, and found the withered remains of an old corpse. Her head was missing, the flesh of her neck torn by the jagged cuts that separated the head from the body. “This isn’t right,” he cried. “This one should’ve been *fresh!”*

“Don’t recognize her?” the voice asked.

Seth turned to reach for his shovel, but it was gone. He turned, and found a tall, thin figure standing beside him. The clouds were beginning to part, and as he saw the figure raise the shovel above their head, Seth found himself distracted by the glint of metal as it came crashing down.

The grave was restored in the dim moonlight, and by the time the sun rose once more, all traces of Seth’s desecration were removed, two bodies now rotting below. The figure kept the shovel for themselves, a reminder of what they’d done. After so many poor souls had their rests interrupted by the tool, he was honored to use it to bring peace to someone who deserved to be buried."

I am one of those people that constantly follow my dreams and I do whatever is necessary to get it even though I always fail. My life long dreams are constantly changing and they can be in any size. A couple of months ago I dreamed of getting a large house in a gated community. I decided to go for it and as I was looking down at a man sleeping and dreaming of my dream home, I wanted it for my self.

 I teared into his brain while he was sleeping and dreaming of my dream home but all I found was brain matter. I kept on trying to tear into his skull because he was dreaming of the home I wanted so badly, but then the sleeping man opened his eyes and told me to ""fuck off and stop following your dreams"" 


Then I dreamed of going somewhere exotic where there is sunshine everyday with the blue skies looking down at me. I then found myself looking down at someone who was dreaming in his sleep of such a holiday and because I wanted to desperately go there myself, I started tearing into his brain and skull but all I found was brain matter and bone. As I kept on clawing into this person's brain he then awoke and told me to ""fuck and stop following your dreams"" 


When people tell me to stop following my dreams it does make me feel bad but it is necessary. A couple of weeks my new dream was to get this super fast car and as I was looking down at a man who was dreaming of the very same car that I had wanted, I teared into his skull and brains. All I found was brain matter but the man never once told me to fuck off and to stop following my dreams. I went further into his body and pulled out organs and other bodily material. I stopped when there was nothing left. 


This happened again when I had aspirations of going into space and I started tearing into someone dreaming of space because I wanted it for myself, but he never once told me to fuck off and stop following my dreams. Everyone's needs something to make them stop. I've just lost mine and because I am not going to stop chasing my dreams I will need someone to tell me to fuck off and stop following my dreams. "

It was quite abstract, with spirals and shadows and contrast, giving its content a shape similar to a human, yet animal, yet mollusc and yet plant, all at once. Why was it so?

Well, i recounted that nature has a tendency to propagate ever more complex, yet self-similar shapes, throughout all levels of size, like fractals. Specifically, life favors the shape given rise from the Fibbonachi sequence. *All* life does. Quarks bond into protons and neutrons, they bond into atoms, they bond into molecules, molecules bond into proteins, proteins into cells, cells into tissue, tissue into organs, and organs into organisms. Throughout all of those levels, the sequence is present. All life propagates it.

Humans too propagate it, you can see it in our buildings, tools, structures and even in our art. The painting before me was proof. I wonder, did the artist painting it weave meaning into other than the sequence into it, or did he simply mindlessly propagate the Sequence, like a zombie? If so, do we have really have free will, if we are to *simply propagate the Sequence?*

Best not to think of it."

Well, when I think of super-soldiers I think of Torture, Experimenting, and Lies.

Because you don’t know the background story of how they become super.

Well I know from past experiences there is nothing super about being experimenting on, and seeing what makes you tick.

And sure I might be stronger than an average man and a healing factor, but do you realize how many nerves in my body have been burn and destroy multiple times? Well, let me tell you one thing. IT SUCKS!!!

And they don't tell you about their little tests, and how many changes you will go through, and the side effects.

I believe that super-soldiers are corrupted, and unstable, because we humans can't handle the power that we have now, And do you know the worst part of this whole thing??

I don't even remember my wife's name - Wait do I even have a wife? - Was I even a good person in general?.

That the type of stuff that they mess around with so that there is nothing in the way of your mission.

But soon enough they are going to realize that they can't control us, We will be more than just super-soldiers we will be gods against men.

Soon they will fear us. Fear of how much power they give us, And will finally understand the true meaning of super-solider.

""What's wrong hon?"" Beth's hushed voice startles me.
""Do you hear crying?"" I asked her. 
She stares at me. And the sobbing gets even louder. Its coming from the basement. 
But when I try to walk over to the basement door, Beth stops me. ""There's no one down there. Its a ghost."" She pulls on my shirt, ""let's go to bed, the crying will stop soon."" I follow her back into bed and immediately she starts to kiss me. I thought it was to calm my nerves. Eventually I fell asleep again. 
The next morning Everything went back to normal and I forgot all about the crying.
Weeks later, I spend the night again except this time. There was no crying. It was just screams. 
My eyes shot open. I almost jumped out of the bed when I heard the first shriek. Beth was still fast asleep. I couldn't understand how she could sleep through that. I tip toe down the hall and stood infront of the basement door. It sounds horrible, like a dying animal. I grip on the doorknob and rip the door open. A cold air hits my body. And the smell made me gag.  I go down. Its dark and the screaming turns into crying again. ""Hello?"" I call out. I take out my phone and turn of the flashlight. 
Then I see him. 
A man chained to the wall. He eyes and mouth are both taped and he's only wearing his underwear. His body is covered in blood and he reeked. ""What the fuck?"" I yell and almost drop my phone. 
""I told you,"" a voice from behind me, ""Not to go down the basement."""

Have you ever seen something in the corner of your eye, or a shadow in a dark room? Do you ever feel like you’re being watched? Because you are. When you try and look, however, there’s never anything there. That’s because they’re already gone. Pray that you don’t see them; if you do it’s already too late.

They look just like us, but they’re not. They just stand and watch, waiting for you to turn around and see them. See them standing right there in the open, watching you. You’ll know it’s them as soon as you see them. You can try to ignore the urge to look, but sooner, or later you will give in. They know this. 

You can’t outrun them, you can’t hide from them. You can’t ignore them either, they know if you’ve seen them. There’s no use pretending otherwise. It won’t make a difference. Once you’ve seen them, they’ve seen you, and when that happens there’s no going back. 

After that it’s up to you. You can try and run, try and keep them at bay, but you’ll be running for the rest of your life. Or, you can accept it and go to them. They can’t move, they can only stand and watch. Watch as you see them, watch as you stand there and make the decision to run or accept your fate. If you do decide to run, they will find you. They never stop. I don’t know what happens when they reach you, or you reach them. I assume you become one of them, but I can’t know for sure, no one can. Until you see them you can’t know what you’ll do. Either way, it’s too late.

Me? I ran. I’ve been running for 3 years. I don’t know how much longer I can run for. As I type this I’m sitting on a train 4000 miles from when I saw the first of them. Every time I see them there’s more of them, and they’re getting closer. I know my time is running out.

The most I can do now is spread the message and this warning: Please, whenever you feel like you’re being watched, no matter how much you want to, however strong the temptation is, DO. NOT. LOOK."

By the time my wrist terminal pulsed, I was dressed and standing to attention. Photos of a middle-aged man spooled across the room, accompanied by a description.

Name: Robert Miller

Age: 44

Hair: black

Eyes: brown

Wanted for: CHILD ABDUCTION

A live feed of the major appeared. His voice echoed through the room. “Attention citizens. Authorities are conducting a manhunt for the criminal known as Robert Miller. All residents prepare to stand on your front porch and notify us of any suspicious activity. On my mark.”

As I moved through the house, the feed switched from the bedroom—

“If you see him—""

—to the hall—

“—tap your wrist terminal—”

—to the living space.

“—and notify us immediately.”

I stood before the front door.

“Opening in 3-2-1.”

The door slid open. I stepped onto the porch and looked around. Nothing.

Spotlights scanned the street. For a moment, one hovered over me. I saluted until it moved on.

A waste container tipped over in the dark. My heart pounded against my ribs.

Robert Miller sprinted across my lawn carrying a little girl in his arms. “Y-you’ve gotta help me, please!”

I tapped my wrist terminal. It pulsed. Spotlights enveloped the garden, then a gust of wind almost knocked me off my feet.

Robert held a hand in front of his face, shielding his eyes. He tried to run, but marines in combat armor abseiled onto the street, cutting off his escape. A marine jammed his baton into the back of Robert’s neck. Blue lightning enveloped his body. He went limp and fell forward, landing on top of the girl.

Military vans pulled onto the street, their sirens blaring. A marine rolled Robert onto his back. The girl wrapped her arms around Robert and buried her head in his chest, sobbing. “DADDY, DADDY WAKE UP!”

The marine grabbed her and hoisted her onto his shoulder. She pounded against his armor, shouting, “NO, NOOOOOOO!”

He carried her into the back of a van and pulled the doors closed. Two other marines hauled Roberts's lifeless carcass into the back of a different van. The searchlights disappeared.

The major’s voice came over the habitation sector’s intercom. “Criminal apprehended. All citizens return to your homes.”

I sighed and went back inside. A news story scrolled across the walls.

“After a violent struggle with authorities, Robert Miller was—”

I drifted towards the bedroom.

“—the girl is now being returned to her parents, who were relieved to hear—""

With a wave of my hand, the news story disappeared. The blue glow of the words faded as the walls turned matte black. I climbed into bed.

My wrist terminal pulsed. A notification popped up.

“They’re gone.” She points up. Little obscure shapes getting smaller and smaller, struggling. So many shapes that they block the stars and turn the sky into a black ceiling. “Now there’s no stars to compare to.”

\*\*\*

*Your smile sends waves of*

*Dopamine, you’re like a sea*

*And I am drowning.*

“That’s not rain…Is it?”

A sticky sprinkling upon my face and chest and eyes. It congeals thick and smells metal. She and I look like newborns recently pulled from the womb, as the blood coats our skins. 

I look up, their bodies are too high to see individual forms, but there is still a perceptible movement, a pulsing like waves, as if the sky was an ocean.

A heart plops a few feet away.

“I’ll give you a sea,” she says. Her face hardens, not at all a smile. The blood pours faster, showers, drenches everything, a landscape of crimson. Thick red puddling, now pooling, now rivers and streams. 

She’s twisting their bodies, way up there, wringing them like towels. Anatomies twisting and stretching like dough, then tearing. Now intestines fall and wriggle, limbs flop down and splash, hearts rain and beat the swarming sea with thuds.

And I am swept away in it all, drowning in viscera and neural matter, swallowed into the maelstrom of broken hearts, until she pulls me out and saves me.

\*\*\*

*I have been waiting*

*For you to take your last breath*

*Till then, time goes slow*

I give her the poem, she reads it, then she runs outside and looks a hundred different directions like she’s trying to figure out how she got here. She drops the poem, lets it land and get soggy in the moist ground that’s a mixture of bone, teeth, dermis. I follow her out, sinking to my shins in the soggy land.  

She looks sad for the first time. But she’s angry again and spits out the words, “I wish your heart bursts!”

And after she voices this wish, it comes true, like all the rest, like wishing people to float up. 

She explodes, spreads herself everywhere like stardust in an expanding universe.

Yes, even though she destroyed everything in my life, broke pieces of me till I no longer recognized myself, I still loved her, was still grateful to wake up every morning and feel the world breathing and us breathing with it.

I lay down, covered in her, I’m sinking, in human remnants, chunks getting in my mouth, in my eyes, in my ears, blocking all sound and sight, there’s a buzzing, like galaxies crashing, as I die it is like…

*I am listening*

*To a universe screaming*

*Your name everywhere.*"
kggkwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kggkwi/a_second_chance/,A Second Chance,148,4,1608412885.0,"   I awoke with a gasp, followed by the thud of my head smacking the fabric above me. As my hands blindly groped the cushioned walls around me in the dark, waves of horror washed over me and I squirmed frantically when I realized where I was. I heaved with all of my strength against the lid above me, but it didn't even give. I tore at the lining of the coffin, to no avail. I was trapped. I was buried alive. There was neither light nor sound around me, I had no way of knowing how deep I was. I yelled out, again and again, I pushed, hit, and tore, but nothing changed. I have no way of knowing how long it was before my voice gave out, or the fire rose in my chest as the air grew thin. Adrenaline pumped wildly, and I futilely flailed against the walls of my prison. As the oxygen ran out, all I could think was ""at least I tried.""

   I awoke again with a gasping breath, followed by the crack of my head smacking the tattered lining of the coffin's lid. My hands stopped wildly feeling the shredded fabric when a word flashed through my mind, ""miracle."" I was alive again. I had been given another chance. That thought, that somehow I had the extra breaths I needed to dig my way to freedom, gave me renowned vigor. I smashed my fist straight above my head, again and again. My body shook as I took advantage of the divine providence given to me. Somehow, I had the opportunity that I needed. The chance to make my way out. That gratitude and determination poured out of me over what felt like hours. The soft lining of the coffin had been obliterated, but I hadn't even dented the metal walls that laid beyond. My lungs cried for breath and, the miracle squandered, I gave in to suffocation again.

&#x200B;

   I could no longer count how many times it had happened but, once again, the shattered fragments of my forehead let out a soft crunch against the iron lid as my body jerked to life. Once more, I was resurrected. I immediately set to work scratching weakly against the metal in the dark. My fingernails were torn free long ago, my fingertips worn to the bone. I sobbed and clawed uncontrollably. How could I save myself? Why was I being brought back? I stopped. For the first time, I heard a sound from the dirt outside my tomb. It was laughter. The derisive laughter of some cruel deity mocking me, drawing joy from my torment. I knew then that I wasn't brought back to have a chance to escape. I was brought back to suffer. For what may have been the hundredth time, I spasmed as my lungs burned for oxygen, and I prayed that when my flesh finally turns to slurry against the metal and my bones are as dust, I may have my release."

“Sure, Mary Ellen.”

I babysat for her three times a week. Cute little six-year-old girl with one of the wildest imaginations ever. She was destined for a career in something creative. All that imagination has to go somewhere. 

“They’re real.”

Oh yeah. We’d been discussing ‘the truth about monsters.’

“No, they aren’t,” I said. “But you had me going for a second.”

“Are too,” said Mary Ellen. “I’ll show you.”

“Okay. Where’s this monster of yours?”

“He lives in our basement.”

Classic. Based on all the accounts I’d come across, that’s where monsters always lived. 

“Right. The basement.”

“C’mon, I’ll show you.”

What else did we have to do? We were a few hours into a six-hour stint. I still had to watch her cartoons, fix her TV dinner, put her to bed, and deal with her dad’s drunken flirtations once he and his wife got home. 

Mary Ellen pulled me across the house by my shirtsleeve. I could barely keep up. I followed her across the house and through the kitchen to the basement door. We’d never gone down to the basement, so I’d never had a reason to notice. But now, I saw that there was a padlock on the door. 

Mary Ellen held a finger to her lips. 

“Don’t tell mom and dad,” she said. “But I know the code. I’ve seen them put it in a thousand times.”

For the first time since we started talking about the monster living in their basement, I was beginning to feel unsettled. If monsters don’t exist, why keep a padlock on your basement door?

Mary Ellen twirled the dial like a seasoned pro. The padlock snapped open and fell to the wood floor with a metallic clunk. Mary Ellen began leading the way down the stairs, which creaked underfoot.

“Let’s turn on the lights,” I suggested, my words shaky.

“Lightswitch is at the bottom,” said Mary Ellen. “Watch your step.”

But on the last stair, I tripped. I sprawled headfirst into the darkness and landed on the hardpacked dirt of the unfinished basement floor. Immediately, a fat, fleshy mass landed on top of me. It was so heavy that I struggled to draw a breath. A horrific stench poured out of the thing’s mouth in spoiled, creamy waves. I closed my eyes and waited for the end.

“Hey you!” said Mary Ellen. “Calm down! Heel!”

I heard the light switch flip, and I opened my eyes. Mary Ellen was standing five feet away. An overweight man was sitting next to her, cross-legged like an obedient dog. Through his leather, zipper-mouthed mask, he panted excitedly. He wore skimpy straps of leather, which sliced through his pale, doughy rolls. 

I saw that Mary Ellen was holding his leash in one hand, a ball gag in the other. 

“Don’t worry,” she said with a perverted smile. “*Puddin’* may seem big and scary, but he’s a pushover once the choker comes out.”"

It’s Maw Maw's famous homemade Christmas sugar cookies. Now before anyone judges, they are the best cookies in the world and I pride myself as being a cookie expert. From the first of December until Christmas Eve that is all I think about, the little snowmen shaped goodness covered in frosting. 

I have to work most holidays, so I can only pop in and have to get right back to work but as I made my way to the kitchen, you can imagine my disappointment as there were only store-bought chocolate chip pathetic excuses for cookies left. How inconsiderate can you be? As I turned to leave, I had a thought cross my mind, “Freaking Steve.”  I whispered to myself, he is the only way one who would do something this vile. Maybe what I did next was a little harsh, but the little prick needed to be taught a lesson. 

I creeped up to his room and to my surprise, I found him waiting, like he knew I was coming. Then the vile little imp laughed “What’s the matter fat boy?”, and I snapped. That would be the last bit of joy he would have for the night. “Screw you, old man!” He growled, spitting blood on me and the floor as he spoke, I didn't mind, I mean I’m dressed all in red anyway and bad little boys need to be corrected. I leaned in close to him, twisting the sharpened candy cane in his chest, “where are the cookies, Steve?” I asked rather calmly I thought, “Thh… there in the drawer.” He said, I could tell it pained him so to tell me, but I was going to get my sweet little cookies one way or another. 

As I left the house delicious morsels of heaven in hand, I thought, “Everything's as it should be, even if I’m a little behind on schedule, it was worth it”, As for Steve he will live and I being the jolly old elf that I am gave him a second chance at the nice list, which shouldn’t be so hard given he doesn't have a tongue to say such horrible things anymore. Well, Christmas Eve is coming and I can hear those sweet treats calling my name.  Remember kids don't skimp out on the jolly old fat man, because the one of the perks of being me is no one will believe you if you say Santa attacked you, just some food for thought.

I'll make this a little bit more interesting. Maybe I'm just trying to confuse you, so all of the time spent debating whether or not you should look under the bed is time where I can sneak up on you.

And maybe I'm bringing this up late so you think I'm making this up, causing you to not look under the bed, because I'm trying to convince you to look under the bed.

Maybe I'm hoping for you to think that, though.

And maybe I'm not hoping for you to not think that. It's a 50/50 chance here. But time may or may not be on your side. So be careful in what you choose.

Just saying. If you choose wrong, you'll make a great meal.

So I'll ask you this question...

Are you going to look under the bed?"
kga2dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kga2dn/madame_laura_dechant/,Madame Laura Dechant,28,2,1608392989.0,"All merriment and conversation stopped when Madame Laura Dechant entered the room.

Every head turned towards the door she emerged from. It wasn’t because she was the banquet’s host. No, it was as if a queen had descended upon them.

Her skin was as white as marble, her hair like spun silk. Her hazel eyes wandered over each guest before a coy smile showed on her face.

With a throw of her long hair, she bid them continue and took her seat at the top of the table.

There she sat, basking in the attention awarded her. There were the longing gazes of men who wanted her and the jealous looks of the woman who wanted to be her.

A new pair had just arrived. One, a man of her retinue, the other a young thing, barely of age. She was shy and nervous as she entered.

She wore a shoddy dress, walked in a tottering way, and almost stumbled over her own feet as she approached the table.

Yet, there was something about her, and Laura noticed that some men regarded the newcomer with more than curiosity.

When she noticed this, Laura got to her feet. With swift steps, heels clattering over the floor, she approached the girl.

Standing in front of her, she stared down with the most condescending of smiles.

“And who might you be?” Laura asked in a warm, kind voice.

“Jeanette, Miss Dechant,” the girl mumbled, eyes downcast.

Laura’s eyes wandered over Jeanette’s body and eventually came to a rest. Not on her shapely body, not on her eyes, her hair, or her face. They came to rest on the girl’s hands.

Jealousy rose and a crude smile distorted her face.

Those hands, Laura thought. They were the most beautiful, delicate hands she’d ever seen.

No one intervened when Laura took the girl’s hand.

Laura smiled at her sweetly.

“Welcome to my home, Jeanette,” she said, her voice dripping with honey.

Everyone was quiet as Laura led the girl along the table, then past it and finally to the door at the end of the hall.

“Where are we-,” Jeanette began to ask, but Laura put a finger to her lips.

“I’d like to talk with you privately, Jeanette,” Laura answers.

The young girl, embarrassed and overwhelmed by the attention, can only nod and when Laura opens the door to her personal quarters, she steps in undeterred.

Again, no one says a word, not even Jeanette’s companion.

As Laura leads her inside, she stares at those beautiful, delicate hands once more, hands so very fitting for her body.

And as the door closes behind them, her attendants are already prepared. The tools and machines are ready, the process perfected over the years.

And once morning arrives, Laura would be just a tad bit more beautiful.

For then, those small, delicate hands would be her very own."

Normally people would just post about series, movies and their general interests, sometimes there would be posts about job offers but those were rather unusual and I never really paid attention to them.

 Until one day, I came across this specific post. I don't remeber exaclty how it was written since it was some time ago, but this is how I think it was. The only part I can't forget was the title.

**""I am looking for someone to kill my daughter""**

""**You must have cickled this post believing it to be a joke or a sick prank, but I'm serious, I'm looking for someone willing to kill my two year old daughter.** 

**Before you call me a monster I'll let you know that this thing I call my child is not actually a human, she is an impostor.**

 **I don't know how but she took my daughter's place and has been pretending to be her since. My husband and other family members seem to not have noticed, I am the only one who can see the little demon for who she really is.**

**She simply appeared one day, I don't even know how she got inside the house or where my real daughter is, is just that one morning I came to wake her up and saw that thing on her bed.** 

**It looks like her but it clearly isn't my baby. I can't take it anymore, it has been months of this insanity, my husband doesn't believe me, the little wretch poisoned his mind and I don't know what else to do.** 

**If you are interested in making good money quickly I'll be wiling to pay a significant amount - ut to 2,500 USD - for you to kill that thing and free me from this hell.**

**I'll be attaching my e-mail adress at the end of this post so we can discuss this more thoroughly, if you're not serious about the job then please don't contact me.**

 **If no one comes up I might have to take action by myself.""**

The post ended with her e-mail adress and I remember seriously questioning if I should contact her or not, of course I didn't want the job but I was wondering if this was real or simply just a sick prank as stated above.

 I just decided to leave the site and didn't think much of it. I came to the conclusion that maybe it was just a joke, they weren't uncommon on the forum but they never went to such level.

I eventually tried to find the post again later but it seems that it was removed. 

I still think about it sometimes, if it was real then that woman might have found someone or either decided to kill her baby girl by herself. Only imagining it makes me sick to my stomach.

I looked around where she was found. Down by the lake where they say she drowned. I figured in this tiny town, the water's safer than the ground.



First I checked up in the tree. The one I climbed so I could see. The very thought that's killing me, my proof of infidelity.



It wasn't there so next I'll check, the stairway where she broke her neck, I hardly stabbed, a loving peck, her tumble caused this massive wreck.



I dragged her out along the floor. The knife was there, not there no more. It could have caught upon the door, as I tugged along this filthy whore.



Up and down and all around, I searched about the entire town, my little knife could not be found, just tattered scraps of evening gown.



I just gave up and went to sleep, sneaking by in silent creep, from her family who loudly weep, and interrupt my counting sheep.



My knife was found! Though not by me. The men in blue, a sight to see. I struggled hard to now be free, but they said penitentiary. 



And now that all these years have passed, I think about that bonny lass, and the knife they found out in the grass, where I chopped apart her cheating ass."

“It’s Hungarian or Romanian, I am neither. I’m American. My family moved over here many years ago.” Dr. Ackula said with a devilish smile. 

Dr. Ackula was aware of the connotations of his name and he’d often make a joke out of it. He’d wear the fake teeth at Halloween and dress in a cape and scare the neighbourhood children. But Dr. Ackula was just a regular doctor. He ran a small surgery, he came out in sunlight, charged a fortune in medical insurance and had a wife – Mrs. Ackula. 

Joe had cirrhoses of the liver. Joe was in his eighties. It was a miracle that he’d even made it this far. This was a late-night call-out. 

Dr. Ackula charged a hefty premium for these call-outs. Joe lay down on his bed. Joe had a big house but the problem for Joe was that it was empty. Joe’s wife (also treated by Dr. Ackula) died about three years ago and Joe had been hitting the bottle hard ever since. This was the first time that Dr. Ackula treated Joe but Joe felt warmth and trust for Dr. Ackula; primarily because of the way his wife was so kindly treated before her death. 

“Doc, you’re not going to drink my blood are you?” Joe laughed. 

“No, just a small shot with this needle.” Dr. Ackula said. 

Dr. Ackula had heard them all. Any pun, any joke, any gag – he’d literally heard them all. 

Dr. Ackula rolled up Joe’s sleeve. Dr. Ackula was good to his patients. He was soothing, calm and had a delicate nature that would put them at ease. 

Dr. Ackula gave Joe a slight prod with the needle and cradled his head into his hands. 

“Joe, you will feel a slight paralysis but no pain thankfully.” Dr. Ackula said. 

Joe mumbled, already finding the difficulty of speech set in early. 

“Now what I have to tell you is very important. Your current condition is all your own doing. Your bad lifestyle, your depression, your negative outlook since your wife died.” Dr Ackula said. 

Dr. Ackula held up the needle into Joe’s fading view. 

“And this is merely to put you out of your misery. Much like I did to your wife.” Dr. Ackula said. 

Joe’s face changed and the little muscle energy left tried desperately to frown. 

“I may not suck blood Joe but if I can’t treat you, you are no use to me alive. Your hard living will be written into the death certificate.” Dr. Ackula said, “I’ve done this many times Joe.” 

And he had done this many times. 

While the name Dr. Ackula may conjure up images of blood-sucking, the only blood-sucking that Ackula did will be to the inherited estate of Joe and Mildred Tanner.  

Dr Ackula pulled out his pen.

Dr. Ackula’s tastes didn’t transcend to the souls and blood of the living. 

Dr. Ackula loved money…"

When I was a child I use to cry a lot but now I literally don't have the ability to cry anymore. Don't get me wrong I can still feel things but just the crying part is gone. I am sure most of you will think that it is an advantage that I cannot cry anymore and you are right, but there are times where I will have to cry like at funerals and other sad situations that have happen to my loved ones or otherwise they will think that I don't care. 

A couple of months ago I was visiting a funeral for one of my relatives and I had forgotten to bring an onion with me to secretly Chop up to make tears come out. I was petrified as everyone was shedding tears I was the only one that wasn't crying, I felt horrible but there was nothing I could do. So after that day I decided that I was going to train myself to cry. 

I remember the first day of my self training and I had a man's chopped off arm with me and I had darkened the whole room while listening to sad music. I was reminiscing all of the bad things that have happened to me in my life and after a week of this, I finally managed to shed a single tear. Then a week later I did the self training again and I had a woman's chopped off leg with me in a dark room that was full of weird music. I was remembering my horrid upbringing and after a whole week of this, I managed to shed a single tear while the smell of a woman's chopped off limb went up my nose. 

It was so exhausting but I did it one last time a couple of weeks later but with a man's chopped off head this time. After a week of that I managed to give out a single tear once again and even with all of the sad music and flash backs into my life and also imprisoning myself into a dark room, I could only give out 1 tear. I decided to give up and go back to carrying an onion wherever I go, I just have to never forget to bring one. "

I woke up thirty minutes before my alarm, stared at the ceiling and contemplated where I was at in life in comparison to where I wanted to be, rolled out of my bed, and shuffled my way to the bathroom for my morning shower. Nothing really seemed to be out of place or askew in any way, but I also have learned NOT to trust my gut when it says something isn't going wrong, my reasoning and thought process have always lead me in the right direction whereas my gut...well that's gotten me into my fair share of trouble. On the car ride to work, my mind was racing, trying to figure out why something seemed so wrong when I had done everything right. I tied a perfect double windsor knot in my tie, styled my hair just right the first try, and made the cute cashier blush when I stopped in for coffee; so what was wrong? I was sitting at my cubicle when Jakob came up to me. 
""Hey Jason, I was wondering if you had a chance to go over yesterday's...."" His sentence trailing off as if he wasn't sure what to say. ""Are you feeling ok?"" He asked me. ""I feel fine. Why do you ask?"" I replied. He looked questionably at me. ""Go look at the mirror in the bathroom.""
I rushed off hurriedly, panicked about what Jakob was talking about. I shoved open the door to the men's room, and sharply turned the corner to the sinks. I stared at my reflection, shocked by what I saw. Half of my skull was missing as if it had been blown off....'So that's what was wrong' I thought to myself as I fell to the floor; deader than a doornail.""

I was fed 3 meals a day and had clothes on my back. My parents were fairly strict, if I do recall, and they did not tolerate very much complaining. 

My mother and my father wed many years before I was born. He worked a 9 to 5 job and my mother stayed home to tend to the house. After I was conceived, my father started picking up overtime to support the new arrival. By the time I entered the world, they had every thing they needed. 

My brother was a little over 4 years my junior. He would always try to come down to play with me, but my father and mother insisted I was to be left alone more often than not. It wasn't until I was about 8, that when I tried to play with him, he ignored me all together. 

Every day I would try to play with him. Cars, action figures, tag, you name it, and I tried. I would go out of my way to try to get him to at least speak to me. Sometimes I would follow him into the basement and watch him play with the train table in front of my door, though he would not acknowledge my existence at all. 

When I was four I always told myself that being an adult seemed too hard. I told my mother when she asked what I wanted to be, I told her that I wanted to be a child forever. Her response was always the same, ""You can be whatever you wish, as long as you don't complain along the way.""

It wasn't until my parents moved the train table and let my brother into my room. All that remained was a chair and a small hole through the bottom of the door that only a plate could get through. It wasn't until they handcuffed him to the chair and slid three trays of food through the door throughout the day he realized. It wasn't long until the small portions and countless beatings led him he to see me. 

My parents buried my brother and I about a mile into the forest that lied behind our house. It has been 40 years that we've been able to play together every single day, so I suppose I can’t complain. My mother died at the age of 47 in a mental institution a few miles from our house, and my father disappeared shortly after they buried my brother.

My brother is 6 and I am 10. I have a feeling we are going to be kids forever, just like I wanted. I do wonder sometimes if being an adult would have been less scary than I imagined. But as my mother always said, ""You can be whatever you wish, as long as you don't complain along the way."""

Coming home from college always excited me not only for the prospect of seeing my family, but for the ability to spend time with our family pet, an old calico cat named Luna.
We weren’t exactly sure how old Luna was, but we suspected she wasn’t exactly a spring chicken due to her slowing gait and poorly groomed hair. Rescued from the woods on our property years ago, we loved her regardless. 
Luna was a tiny creature and she enjoyed my presence, constantly sleeping on my feet at night and pinning them to the bed with her plush, warm body. I didn’t mind, of course. 
One night, I was having trouble sleeping. Luna had yet to curl up on my feet and I was considering stepping into the hallway to call her name when I felt that familiar pressure on the foot of my bed. 
“Hey Luna girl.” I whispered. I felt her warmth on my feet and the pressure that came with it. I was happily pinned and quickly fell asleep. 
The next morning, I woke to my parents arguing in the living room. Rubbing my eyes and poking my head out of my bedroom door, I overheard them frantically trying to figure out who was the last to leave the house the night before. 
I wandered down the hall and asked what was amiss.
“Luna was shut outside all night last night!” My mother shouted, shooting my dad a sideways glance. 
“Your father was the last one to bring in firewood last evening and he must have left the poor thing outside all night!”
Luna sat on the back of the couch, blinking slowly at me and gently swaying her tail back and forth, seemingly unchanged by the entire ordeal. 
A chill crawled out from my spine as I remembered the pressure on my legs the night before, pinning me to the bed and rendering me unable to move...

“Dad it’s okay, you don’t remember me, but we have this conversation every day. It’s Michael!” implores the son, a calmness in his voice that provides some reassurance. Michael...I think to myself, now where do I know that name?

“Have you had your tablets today?” He asks me. I don’t remember. “Yes I have I say” not knowing if I actually have. Still bemused by what’s going on, I take a seat in my armchair and notice the photos of my beautiful wife, but she looks much older than I remember. 

“Where’s Margaret?” I ask him.

“Mum is...she’s gone to stay with Lizzie for a bit, for that...show, remember?” What bloody show is he talking about. As I am thinking he shuts the door of the fridge when I see a post-it note on it.

*Dad it’s Michael, I’ll be around by noon. I got you a fresh carton of milk so don’t go to the shops!*

Michael...oh my god, Michael!!!!

“You’re not my son!” I exclaim, gritting my teeth and raising my finger at him. He stops instantly, puts down the shopping bag on the counter and reaches into his coat pocket.

The silver of the ring glints off the starlight above, and the soft whimpering of the poor creature without a heart is carried through the stinging wind. The mans face is a void and he radiates no remorse for taking the vital organ from another. His beard, grey and coarse with the weathering of time, hangs low and covers his nakedness. To him the stars are family he needs to feed, they thirst for life. They crave death, but not maliciously. He and his pin-prick family have no intent on spreading blood or guts or gore.

My whole childhood, my dad strictly enforced one major rule.  You must never enter the land where nothing grows.

My grandad had constructed a fence around the land where nothing grows because it can be hard to tell once everything dies off in the winter.  We were forbidden to enter that area regardless of the season.  In the summer, you can clearly see it.  The fields are filled with trees, brush, and sage, but there is one small area where it just stops.  

The land where nothing grows is about 50 yards from one side to the other, in a perfect circle.  The circle is surrounded by vegetation, but inside that perfect circle, you will find only dirt.  Dad forbade us from taking one step over the line.  The one time I got even close my father was so furious that I spent the whole weekend digging fence post holes. 

One time, my favorite dog ran into the circle.  It was my fault, I threw the stick too far.  I watched him run into the circle, but when I got to the edge to call him back, he was gone.  I never saw that dog again.

Another time I found a sick cow in the middle of the land where nothing grows, she had walked over the toppled fence.  Normally we would have nursed the cow to health, but my dad refused to let me go get her.  Instead, he used his rifle to put the cow out of her misery from beyond the line.  The next day, the carcass had vanished.

When I was 19 my dad went missing.  His mind had grown far older than his body, but the stubborn and confused old man insisted that he work on his ranch.  I found his boot prints leading straight into the land where nothing grows.  I never saw him again.

11 years later, I now manage the family ranch.  The older I get, the more fearful and intrigued I grew of the land where nothing grows.  I had rebuilt the old fence to keep the cows out, but something just felt like the circle called to me.  

One day, while I was walking by, I saw my dad’s old battered hat in the circle, 5 feet from the edge.  Without a doubt, I knew it was his, I had to get it.  I placed planks over the edge to keep me off the dirt.  I crossed the line for mere seconds, grabbing the hat and never touching the dirt.  Nothing happened, but my back and knees suddenly ached.

It wasn’t until I looked in a mirror that I realized the truth.  My skin was wrinkly and my hair turned grey.  I had aged 20 years in my 2 seconds in the land where nothing grows.

Never enter the land where nothing grows."

“I don’t get it,” she mumbled. “You slayed the dragon, I saved the kingdom. Shouldn’t we get a ‘happily ever after’?”


“Normally, yes. But it appears our narrative is ending.” He lit his pipe, inhaling sweet tobacco.


“Narrative?” The princess quizzically asked. 


He blew a circle of smoke out. “There are three types of people. There are Writers, Readers, and Livers. It is the Liver's job to live their lives, the Writer's job to document the Livers life, and the Readers job to observe the Livers life.” He leaned back, watching the mountains around them twinkle out of existence. 


“But what does that MEAN?” She asked. “Why is our world disappearing?”


“Because we have finished living our story.” He answered calmly. 


“But we didn’t die! I can go home, and marry the prince, the nightmare is over!”


The wizard chuckled. “No, sweetheart. If you were a Reader, maybe, but we were born Livers. We only exist to be recorded and observed.”


“Observed by who?”


“Those above us.” He gestured to the sky. “A Writer is writing this, and soon some Readers will read it. Once they’re done, we won’t have any more reason to exist, so…” He made a pfft sound, pushing his hands apart. 


“The rest of our lives? Why don’t we get to live them?” 


“They aren’t important to this Narrative.” 


She scoffed. “That’s not fair! You’re saying some people only exist to fulfill their story, then they disappear? Who would make a world like that?”


He gave her a mournful look. “I’m sure they don’t mean to. See that forest over there, disappearing? It’s as real as anything, but to someone watching us from above, it’s nothing more than words on a page. Just like you and I.”


“But other stories have happy endings.” 


“If their narrative explains a person's happy ending, then they get to live it. It appears our Author had a limited amount of space to explain our world, so we have to stop existing once they run out of room.”


“Are they God?” She asked in a soft voice.


“In a way.” He answered. “But there’s an Author above Them also, and one above that, and so on. Just like there are stories below us, we ourselves act as Readers when we tell them.”


“What’s at the top?” She asked, the cliffs around them beginning to dissipate.     


He shrugged, arms starting to flicker in and out of existence. “We’re getting to the end, apparently there’s no more story to tell. We saved the kingdom.” 


“Why did it matter?” She asked quickly, before the wizard could disappear. 


“Did you enjoy the adventure?” 


She paused. “I- Yes.” 


“That’s it,” he grinned. “It’s all about the scenery along the route.” He said, before he vanished completely. 


She sat alone, watching her world slip away all around her. 


“But I don’t want to go,” she said, before she faded away."

kfpgbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kfpgbh/im_losing_weight/,I’m losing weight,66,9,1608312394.0,"  For the past two months I have been losing weight. Slowly but surely. It’s not a big problem really, as during the semester I have gained a lot and to be honest I’m still a bit chubby, despite the constant weight loss. Still it is a bit strange as i have not changed my habits at all, and have not started exercising as I have promised myself.

It must be the lack of sleep. You see, around three months ago I started to have a recurring dream. You know the one, where your teeth fall out. Except in my dreams it’s only one at a time, but always a different one. The dream comes every five or six nights, and I wake up drenched in sweat, completely exhausted. The first couple of times I rushed out to the bathroom to have a look but all my teeth were there, the same cigarette yellowed ones.

It’s strange you know, I eat a lot more than I used to, but when I finish I still feel hungry. It occured to me that I may have a parasite. The thought of a multitude of worms crawling around in my guts is not a pleasant one. I have been to the doctors office, but they couldn’t find anything in my fecal sample, except signs of malnourishment. I have been advised to eat more. Great, thanks Sherlock.

One thing I noticed is off (aside from the dreams), is that it has been getting harder and harder to clean my teeth. Little pieces of food somehow manage to stick really hard between them and on them and I have to scrub for a really long time to get rid of them.

I know for sure that I have a parasite, it can’t be anything else, but they hide themselves so good the doctors can’t find them. I have a plan, I’m going to starve them. If they have no food they have to consum eme, and they can’t do that without revealing themselves.

The first day of starvation was easy. I only drank water, and aside from uncomfort nothing was really bothering me. On the second day however I discovered that I started to chew on the inside of my mouth and tongue. Little cuts were spread all over them. By the end of the day the cuts opened further and were bleeding constantly. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow becouse this is not normal. But now I have to sleep, the blood loss and the starvation weakened me. 

I started burshing my teeth to get the metallic taste out of my mouth. The toothbrush caught on something and pulling it out was painful and hard. Inspecting the bloody tool, I found some of the bristles were missing. Strange, but I had no time to think on it, as I was feeling worse and about to faint. I tripped before the bed, and, as I was losing consciousness under it I saw teeth."

It was a simple, vertical line dividing the sky from horizon to horizon.

People all over the world stared at it in awe.

Scientists believed it to be an atmospheric phenomenon; religious men and cult leaders alike proclaimed the end of the world.

Jeremy Wilkin’s had his own ideas.

He sat on his porch, sipping on a beer and staring at the sky. After a while, his wife joined him, looking at him, then casting her eyes upwards as well.

“What do you think it is?” she asked.

“It’s humbug, that’s what it is! A farce put up there to scare us!”

“But, Jerry, dear, who’d do something like that? I mean, it’s been up there for days!”

“Has to be that Bezos fellow or the Gates one! They with all their money and all that new technology and-“

“Oh, shush, Jerry, you’re always going on about those folks!”

“Well, they’ll always be messing around with our lives and now they’ve done this! Split the goddamn sky in half and-“

“Jerry, don’t curse like that! What if Pastor George hears about it!”

“Pah, give a rat’s ass about Pastor George! Damn him and his sermons! Been sick and tired of them for years. Only god thing about this whole Covid business is that his damned church stays closed!”

His wife Lizzy gasped in shock at his outburst.

“How can you say something like this? What’s the matter with you?”

For the first time in what must’ve been hours, Jeremy Wilkins turned his eyes from the sky and looked at her. He sighed before he took another sip of his beer.

“It’s the damned thing up there! Making me crazy! Feels like there’s something up there, almost as if-“

“Maybe you ought to stop staring at it all day, you old fool,” his wife said laughing, but it was a nervous laugh.

For a while she traced the line with her gaze, staring at the horizon and going ever higher until she had to crane her neck to see it.

Suddenly her husband got a hold of her arm. His grip was hard, yet his arm was shaking.

“Jerry, what’s-“ she started, but broke up when she saw her husband’s face. It had turned into a mask of terror. His eyes were wide, his mouth hung open, but all that escaped it were indistinguishable noises.

His free arm rose shakingly, pointing at the sky right ahead.

When she looked, she saw the line fizzling, saw a pair of gigantic hands pushing through it.

Then they reached out to the left and right. Fingers sunk deep into what should be nothing but empty air got a hold of the sky and started tearing.

Jeremy and Lizzy Wilkins sat on their porch, watching in a mixture of wonder and utter despair.

Slowly and steadily the line expanded as the hands tore apart the fabric of reality itself, revealing the madness that lay beyond the stars."

She's no longer been her bright cheery self. She sits in her chair crouched in a fetal position. If she's ever walking, she's pacing slowly and shifting her weight from side to side. My Dad, my sister, and I have been trying to help her get better, but nothing seems to help. We've been trying to get her to talk about what she's feeling, and all she says is she’s dead. She never means dead inside, but literally dead. She’s asking us how we don’t know that. We keep telling her that she isn’t dead and that she’s right here. She keeps denying this.

Mother has been making weird demands. That we find her body. Give her a funeral. Let her go. That kind of thing. She says she sees her skin decomposing and smells her decaying body in the forest. I keep asking her what she’s talking about. She’s referring to a night she came home late after having meeting friends. She came home around 11pm, and we assumed she lost track of time. The strange thing was that her car is nowhere to be found. We asked her if she walked home, and all she tells us she died in a wreck. According to her, she slid off road and her car tipped over. The impact killed her; she says. We’ve been trying to convince her that she’s alive. Nothing is helping.

Then, I got a call from the police. The officer on the line said that a car was found on the side of the road, tipped over. The person inside, who had been dead for days, fits my mother’s description. They wanted someone to come to the morgue and identify the body. I was frozen with uncertainty after hanging up. My mother walked up to me, and I felt a cold draft wafting through my body.

“See you at the funeral,” was the last thing she said before she evaporated in the thin cold air."

The officer cruises the streets slowly. Until finally, through the dense fog, a pale, slender figure can be seen stumbling down a sidewalk in a rural area. 

The officer pulls ahead of it and steps out of his cruiser. He stands on the sidewalk until the person finally begins to approach. But it then begins to stumble at a rapid pace and the officer draws his taser. To his absolute and utter horror, the pale figure isnt human. It is pulsating and has no distinctive features other than a noticable line down the center of it's body and three empty holes on it's face where eyes and mouth should be.

The officer lurches backwards in disgust and quickly draws his firearm, shooting off 5 panicked shots, striking the thing twice. The creature lets out an unearthly screech, and crawls rapidly up to the officer when it's body opens up like a clam down the middle, revealing it to be an empty, meaty shell of a humanoid. It envelops the officer, now screaming at the top of his lungs, and it's body begins to gain the officer's skin color. It bends and twists with the poor man's screaming muffled inside. It sprouts hair in the fashion of the officer, mimicking scars, facial features, and all. Then the screaming stops. 

The officer was last seen by a pedestrian who heard him screaming. He was seen walking back to his cruiser, smiling devilishly from ear to ear. His eyes were a pitch, tar-black.



[Investigation log...11/19/96] 
It has been 2 weeks since the strange disappearance of officer Barclay. The dense fog that surrounds the geography of the town has been know to cause casualties including an unfortunate car accident back in '86. But the air of mystery surrounding this case is unlike anything the residents and law enforcement of the small town of Pinetip Valley have ever seen. The strangest part is, there have been 4 sightings of a ranger wearing a torn and stained uniform walking along the sides of some rural highways in the past 9 days. These accounts were all reported when the forest is blanketed in the dense fog that Pinetip Valley is known for. Another mystery from the fog."

It was the middle of the night, and he was awake but flooded with a feeling of dread. Then he realized why, as he recognized a familiar shape out of the corner of his eye. Mr. Shadow, a sleep paralysis demon that haunted him for years, until his therapist taught him to dispel the nocturnal visitor. Mr. Shadow would torment Ben when he was younger and stressed by bullies or school. Mr. Shadow would taunt him about his grades, about nobody liking him, while applying pressure to his chest and making it hard for him to breathe, incapable of fighting back as he would be fully paralyzed somewhere between dreaming and awake. 

“Ben, what happened to you? You are bald as a q ball and connected to machines… do not tell me that you are dying?” taunted the shadowy demon. “All that hard work and clean living, and this is what you get? It does not seem fair, does it Ben?”

“No, it is not fair” responded Ben, “But at least you are here, I really do not want to be alone”. Mr. Shadow moved closer into Ben’s peripheral vision, a wicked grin almost coming into focus before retreating into darkness. 

“You want me here? Now I know you have lost it… I taunted you as a child and as a teen, I made you wet your bed way past when it is was acceptable, I threatened you with terrible futures of being a failure and a loser”. 

“But you could not guess this shitty future, could you Mr. Shadow? In all of your anxiety manifesting powers, in all of your dark tormenting, in all of your reaching into my deepest fears, neither you nor I knew this shit would happen. It makes everything else seem trivial in comparison”. 

Mr. Shadow moved closer into Ben’s vision, half a dark face eclipsing Ben’s view of the ceiling. “I guess this is it” said Mr. Shadow. “You are going to die”. 

“Yeah, probably not tonight but sooner or later. And all I can do is ache and feel sick and tired, so believe it or not you are a welcome distraction for once. Please stay; let’s talk even if you are an asshole as always, at least I will not be alone”. 

Mr. Shadow responded “But you are all alone, remember what the therapist said, how I’m all in your head?”  
 

“Well what is in my head is not half as bad as the shit in my Pancreas, Mr. Shadow, so like I said you are a welcome distraction for once. Also if you are in my head, you die with me, Mr. Shadow”. 

The demon moved in closer, putting its weight on Ben. It made whispery noises, but it was not its usual cackling. It sobbed softly, as it lay on Ben. Under the weight and the sobbing, Ben smiled and drifted back to sleep."

They were a fascinating little toy, all dressed up in a tiny little suit, looking up at you with incredibly lifelike eyes and faces.

They'd talk to you, but they'd be very quiet, almost a whisper as you tried to hear what they said, that was the game of it. It was very cute, watching everybody walk around, holding the dolls up to their ears like they were on a call with the tiny things.

They'd keep you company, whispering things into your ear when you were bored. It stuck around, even after you put the thing down.

But I also remember the first case. It even happened down my street.

Bloodied, bruised and beaten was the way to describe little Penny Ash, as they wheeled her corpse out of her house on a stretcher, her older brother John being led to a police car, babbling about his whisper person telling him to do it.

Once that first happened, it spread all over the world as children and even a few adults went on to murder innocent people.

All of their excuses? ""The whisper person told me to.""

Those few weeks before the company that sold the things took them back was hellish, as people were killed every night in houses everywhere, you sat there wondering if you would turn, or if your friend would turn. Every given moment became a waking nightmare.

Until finally, they were taken away.

It's been years since the whisper people came about, and years since I had one. I'm glad that I escaped, but even just owning one of those things apparently leads to some... side effects.

Do you remember what I said about the whispers sticking around?

Because even now, all of those years later...

I can still hear those evil demons whispering in my ear."

I met my wife 20 years ago and we both decided that I will stay at home to look after the kids and she will open up a business. She has done very well with her business but she has also fallen out of love with me and I was very sad to learn about this. I have not worked in 20 years apart from cleaning, cooking and looking after the kids and so in the divorce I will get quite a substantial amount of money. I will definitely need it to restart my own life from scratch. My wife was also cheating on me with some other fella I had never seen or heard of. 

With my wife having to give a lot to me in term of financial security, she will unfortunately have to cut all bonuses for her employees this year, and she has told me that this has angered them. She spoke to her employees and she told them about the cutting of bonuses for this year and possibly for the next 3 years because of me. She used me in her speech as the reason for it all. 

Apparently they are angry at me and my wife told me this over the phone but I thought this was just a ploy to manipulate me to not take much money from her in the divorce. Then my house started getting targeted by hooded individuals and I noticed that I was being followed by people whose faces were covered by masks. I started to get threats to my life through email and social media if I make it a hard divorce for my soon to be ex wife. 

I did the usual of calling the police and making sure I get a good amount of protection. So I was sure that I had nothing to worry about now and my house stopped getting targeted by hooded individuals, nor was I being followed around anymore and my social media accounts and emails wasn't being harassed with threats. Then one midnight I was awaken to find all of my wife's employees in my bedroom and they all had a knife in their hands. They threatened to cause me so much pain if I take so much from my wife in the divorce. 

I saw nothing in the cameras and the police couldn't find any evidence as to how these people entered my house. My wife doesn't live in the house anymore and I still awake in the middle of the night to find my wife's employees in my room, who are all staring at me. Their eyes are all black, my wife's employees are not human. 

I am still going to go through with it though."

He adjusted the damp straps of his day pack and peered to his left. The shine was a tiny doorknob, attached to a mossy, coal black door the size of a shoebox lid. Maybe it was an art piece? William jokingly knocked on the door. 

A small squeak of the entrance creaking open, and a misshapen creature emerged from the tree’s base. The body was an unpleasant pale color like dried glue, about the size of a large bullfrog, and its features were ratlike among folds of fat. Its beady green eyes fixated on William, mouth grinning toothily.

*“Thank you much for your loud knock, I am Countess River-Sand. And now I bow to you, kind sir, your wish is my command. But be warned and listen close, my power isn’t free. After you release my bond, I’ll collect my wishing fee.”*

William, after some initial terror at this monstrosity, began to rationalize his thinking as some sort of heat exhaustion hallucination. He began to gulp from his water bottle in large mouthfuls. The creature observed William’s erratic movements and croaked once more.

*“A water bottle is what you require, and now its volume will never expire.”*

And the water bottle did not run dry. William gulped and gulped, but the level of water never went down. He looked at the bottle, then at the creature.

“You can grant my wishes? Any wish?”

*“A wish as big as planes or mice. For now, I mark the wishing price.”*

A long inky line appeared on William’s forearm, the creature looking content. William grinned. He had a lot of wishes to make.

For the next lovely week, wish after wish was made and granted. A fast sports car. A mansion with a heated pool. The love of his beautiful Lauren, a high school sweetheart who he had missed dearly ever since. Rows upon rows of black lines on his forearms.

Finally, William had everything he wanted. It was time to let the creature go. William called the creature over, ever so simpering and toad like.

“I have no more use for wishes, Countess. I release you from my service.”

*“You’ve cut my chain, and from past decree, I now collect your wishing fee. Beware, my friend, your price is large. Truly, a real substantial charge. I’ll take what’s owed, a meal in my sight. Take heed and hide from all my bites.”*

The creature disappeared in a snap. William looked at his forearm, watching the black lines disappear. He felt odd. Something wasn’t right. What did the creature want? A bite?

On cue, the monster’s voice echoed through the mansion.

*“I found a snack laying on your bed. Plump and tasty, I’ll start at the head.”*

William fell onto the sofa. His realization had just kicked in. He didn’t want to go upstairs anymore, upstairs to his wife.

He heard Lauren scream, then crunching."

I was hungry and tried to feed on their emotion, assuming it to be fear for my safety. It tasted different, but it was the best thing I had ever tasted. It was not until later that I understood I had tasted love, mistaking it to be fear.

We rode to The Venetian in a limo with a handful of our closest friends, chatting and laughing as we reminisced on some of our most memorable senior year events.  Like the time Tommy took a piss in the stairwell, or Stacy Lainhart called Mr. Schielder out on his visible boner.  When all the laughter had begun to subside, I’d turned to Chey and asked her if she’d remember the first time I told her I loved her.  And she did.  Last day of junior year.  On a scorching, yet all the more comforting walk home.  

She’d said she’d only loved me more with every passing day since.

All throughout the magical night that followed, I swear I could not have taken my eyes off of her.  The way her smile shone brighter than the lights decorating the dance floor.  The way her dainty fingers ran through my hair during each and every slow song.  How it felt to hold her close, and to know beyond a shadow of a doubt… yeah.  I did it.  I may not have been quarterback of the football team, valedictorian, prom king… or any of that.  But I found the person I was sure to spend the rest of my life with.  And that was how I knew…. I was the real top of the class.  With her by my side, I would forever be a winner.

I would never let her go.

At least, that’s how it should’ve been.

The only comfort I have now, as I sit in my cold and lonely prison cell, is she won’t be dancing with anybody else tonight.  That the last man she’d kissed was the grim reaper himself.  

And I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I took that knife to her throat.  But she knew what she was doing.  She knew what she was doing when she kissed another man… a man she had deemed tougher, braver, better than I was.

And so, I’ll dream away tonight.  About the dance we could’ve shared.

About the life I could’ve had."

She had decided to hold her conference here so her guests could enjoy the wall-to-wall panorama of the city behind her. She felt at home in her penthouse office, above the noise of the traffic below. She took a sip of Evian water and began. 

“As you know, the media has not been kind to the police force lately. The general public has begun to rally for people of color. There are many people who would benefit from years of rehabilitation who are being released back into the public. The laws for drug-related crimes and other predominately colored misdemeanors are changing. And the very public we protect is *calling* for it. 

The Conway rehabilitation centers -“ (she disliked the word ‘prison’) “- across the United States must simply adapt. The care that our facilities provide is desperately deserved in these changing times. It is the duty to this country, to this companies shareholders and to the American public that we continue to strive forward.” 

Marissa paused to look at her notes. She didn’t need them, but gazing at her own elegant cursive felt like she was looking at her own face in a mirror. She smiled and took a quick, cool, breath. Her words fell out like a mantra. 

“As the economy continues to stumble into the dark pitfalls brought on by irresponsible consumers, arrest rates for theft, and failure to pay bills are skyrocketing. Conway will continue to be fed a steady stream of the desperate, broken wanderers who wreak havoc upon the American system. Our corporate partners will raise prices for us to tempt them. We will punish them for being greedy and for asking too much. We shall cease to see color. And - we will consume anyone who is not deserving of this world we are building together.”"

No surprises there as I had been awake for almost 5 hours past crawling in my guest bed with every intention to fall asleep as fast as I could to welcome the safety of sunlight, it must be almost 2am.

The sound of the grandfather clock in the hallway had always made be uneasy.
It felt felt like it surrounded me, the only noise that pierced the unnerving silence, I had always felt on edge sleeping over at my grandparents house.
I turned in the darkness and squinted and could see my brothers outline on the other single bed parallel to mine, his small shadow just merely a bump with some hair near his pillow. I was annoyed, how could he be so unbothered by this creepy brick room so far away from the safety of our normal beds and familiar house.

The room was old, furniture and children's toys from another era surrounded me, this was a room we would instinctively avoid playing in despite extensively and thoroughly investigating every other inch of our grandparents fascinating house.
I whisper through gritted teeth

""Sam""

I see movement but no response, i can hear his heavy breathing but hes not waking any time soon.. Alone to fight my anxiety and the ideas I cant fight seeping into my head I decided a walk was the simplest distraction, i flop my legs over the side of the bed and stick out my toes till I feel the cold floorboards and stand up, off the bed.

I scuttle my way to the bathroom as quickly and quietly as I could, in my mind any break of pace would be spell certain doom in my overactive imagination
As I reach the hallway I can see at the other end to the left a warm light coming from the toilets.

Someone must have left it on? My heartbeat increases and my thoughts start to scramble with all the terrors I could conjure in my head, the unknown allowing my brain to create any number of unrealistic yet still terrifyingly vivid combinations.

As I carefully turn the corner to and peep out, trying to convince myself my imagination wasn't reality, I see my brother with a small plastic cup getting water

I breath a sigh of relief and approach the toilet
As I pass Sam my stomach became twisted like id been punched

Who was in his bed?"

She knew that in a few hours she'd be with her big family for the holidays and would bear all the stress that comes with it. But for now, going down the forgotten back roads, she felt calm.  She was enjoying her self so much she almost didn't notice the woman on the side of the road. Almost. 

&#x200B;

Of course, she couldn't just leave her there. She  pulled over to check on the woman. ""Hey, are you alright?"" She shouted as soon as she stepped out. No answer. She hurried over, something was definitely wrong. The woman weakly shifted her head towards Ana as she jogged up to her. At least she was still alive, though Ana couldn't imagine how. Maybe she just had a weak stomach, but she felt queasy just looking at her. Her dark hair was thinning, her skin had a dark yellow tinge to it, and she was so thin it looked like her skin was simply draped over her bones. Despite her deathly thin body, her stomach was still visibly bloated. 

Ana took a deep breath and crouched down with the woman

""Hey, are you ok? I'm going to call 911,"" she tried to be reassuring, ""You're going to be ok."" The woman groaned loudly as Ana fumbled for her phone, revealing a mouth full of broken teeth.  ""You're going to be ok."" She said again dialing the number, but the woman groaned again. And again. Each time more panicked than the next. 

""911, what's your emergency?""

&#x200B;

Her groans turned to shrieks and gags

&#x200B;

""H-Hello? My name is Ana. I've just found this woman on the side of the road. I think she...""

&#x200B;

The womans mouth opened wide. The antennae came out first.

&#x200B;

""Hello?  Are you there?""

&#x200B;

Then the mandibles

&#x200B;

""What the fuck?""

&#x200B;

The head came next, straining against her lips before the corners split, leaving just enough room for it to squeeze its way out

&#x200B;

""ma'am? Is everything ok?""

&#x200B;

It just kept crawling out. It was at least four feet long, with thousands of legs

&#x200B;

Ana couldn't even hear the woman on the phone anymore. She could only focus on the gore covered creature in front of her. She stared at it, unable to move until it twitched. She only got a few steps before it caught up with her. She screamed and tumbled backwards as she felt the thousands of legs tickling her while it climbed up her body. Hot tears rolled down her cheeks as the creature pried open her lips, splitting them open and pushing past her teeth

She had not remarried.

If you listened to my grandmother speak about her life, which I alone within my family did, you understood she felt her years had been a succession of cruelly dashed hopes. Her parents had died when she was a girl. War had crippled her. Yet she had opposed leaving Russia to the last hour, and it had pained her daily to see my grandfather toil for the benefit of men who mocked and mistreated him.

In her final years, she considered it a neverending insult to have descendants as thoroughly Americanized as we.

But even I did not realize the bitterness and acidity she had accumulated. Although we knew she did not have friends or happiness in the United States, not even I could have imagined the power and depth of her hatred, or predicted its devastating consequences.

Although my grandmother had few possessions when she died, and there was consequently little interest in her will, she left to me what she had cherished most, her collection of rare books. It was there that I discovered a letter inscribed with my name, to be opened upon her death.

I did so immediately following the cremation. The letter contained the following instruction: ""Scatter my ashes on Liberty Island.""

This required a permit and I applied for one.

It was days later, while seated on a white ferry crossing calm inland waters, holding the urn containing her ashes, surrounded by tourists, that grief hit me hardest, and it was then I truly said goodbye.

After we landed, I recited a prayer, opened the urn and let the winds take her remains.

I closed my eyes.

And opened them to: tourists gathering around me, speaking, gasping, and pointing at the Statue of Liberty, around whose base my grandmother's ashes swirled, a dark buzzing cloud, rising and rising until the entire figure was cloaked—

A cloak which fell away like sand revealing:

*Emptiness.*

The Statue of Liberty was gone.

Devoured by the ashes, which had grown in volume and were accelerating, circling the island like a runaway ribbon of death as we stood stunned with phones in outstretched hands, before condensing into a black sphere and shooting across the bay toward Manhattan.

The rest I remember from news footage and YouTube:

Ashes looming over downtown like a storm cloud; 

Descending like fog;

Consuming skyscrapers, vehicles, people—

until they were all emptiness and New York City itself was but a vacancy beneath a cosmic blanket. Then too that blanket fell, smothering whatever life remained and settling into an eerie wasteland, an earthen scar where nothing grows, the wind never blows, and my grandmother's ashes lie dormant in a gray and hateful peace."

Under the right circumstances, it can also be their prison.

I've holed up in my own house for almost a week now. I've made sure to give the impression that nobody was home, but I think they suspect that I'm in here.

Unfortunately, it's *why* I'm hiding out in my own home like the pathetic coward I am. Specifically, who's laying siege to my house, where I made the idiotic mistake of not stocking any weaponry. I'm writing this down while my laptop still has battery power, because the psychos cut the power to the entire damn neighborhood. I don't know how they did that.

They called themselves the Children of the Midnight Prince. Their beliefs follow a god called, well, the Midnight Prince.

For whatever reason, they think *I'm* the Midnight Prince. They truly believe I'm their god. No matter how much I try to tell them, they won't listen.

I've called the police to report the wackos, but then the power went out and I lost all signal. If that weren't enough, 911 doesn't seem to work at all.

So I'm going to hide out in here until they stop trying to gang-kidnap me and maybe find some other schmuck to harass. I've been able to ration my food for a good while, but I'll run out eventually.

I just heard a noise downstairs. It's probably nothing, but I'm locking the door just in case.

I think they broke in. All I have to protect myself is this worthless hammer.

Well... here goes nothing."

           I've seen thousands upon thousands upon millions being tortured by these entities, and they would be better off dead, than the tortured, pitiful existences that they are barely living. Being kept alive through unknown dark means and magic, these poor souls are driven to the brink of insanity through torture, fear, and anguish, but are brought back by the beings with sadistic glee only to push them to the brink once again. The Great Ones are once again awakening from their slumbers. Prepare for an eternity of suffering, mortal.

We have created the perfect room where anything is possible.

All you need to do is to think about it and it will appear...

Hello, my name is a professor. Crow and for the last 4 years, I have been working on an “Imaginary room” where you go to a room with a special pair of VR headset that is connected to your brain and a suit.

And everything you think of will appear in front of you, and with the VR suit, you can feel everything.

The temperature, The warmth, The ground, The fresh air. Everything that makes you think you are actually in the real world.

And this helps people accomplish the dream that they can’t cause personal problems, And that’s the problem... 

People get too caught up in the “Room” so bad that they refuse to take it off.

And I know what it is like Because when I put it on I walk for the first time in such a long time (Paralysis).

But people must learn that this isn’t real, maybe this is our fault since the mono is a bit misleading.

And that’s what hurt the most.

Knowing that we have to go back to the real world. Knowing that we just can’t walk away from the real world, Even if it kills us.

Sometimes I think to myself that I hate what I have created.

The thing that should be creating dreams, but it is destroying them.

Maybe that is why we dream, Cause it is the closest way of getting out of reality.

But what if we can create control it? We can finally create our matrix.

Or maybe, Or maybe---- sorry I caught up in the moment, but maybe that is why we live to shape our reality.

But what if life is actually about dying, So if that is true then let's hope there is an afterlife where everything is perfect.

A place with no problems or corruption. 

Cause we are no near close to creating our utopia Because deeply we both know that it doesn't exist."

Noah was alone at home one weekend and decided to invite two of his friends over. One of them brought a guy named Trevor, Noah didn't really knew him but he had a bad reputation at school.

This is why he refused to take from Trevor's weird looking pills, it could be anything. But he was still convinced to take it from the three other people and opened another beer. It was his fourth already. Or fifth? Did it matter?

It’s strange to think that he never lost interest in that thing but to be fair, it was a pretty damn beautiful tree.

The tree’s branches were surprisingly sturdy. Sometimes, when the days grew increasingly longer we put up a swing for little Connor. That only seemed to boost his interest even more. 

As little Connor grew older he didn’t seem so little anymore. Yet his love for everything nature never faded away. Even if he visited us less. The times he did appears at our doorstep, hugging us both and went straight for the tree. 

Sometimes my wife would offer him food, but he always refused, she would sit next to him and smile. He never returns the favour. 

His mother barely came with him anymore. The one time she did she brought her alcohol with her. 

Connor became gloomier and gloomier every time he found his way to our household. He looked thinner too. That’s one more reason for my wife to offer him food. She sat next to him once again and smiled widely, holding a plate of freshly baked cookies in her right hand, nudging for Connor to take a couple.

For the first time in years, he smiled and took one of them. My wife asked him to stay for the night as he smiled and agreed.

As we finished our dinner he looked at us with a tear in his eye. He hugged us, told us he loves us and went to bed. He told us he was tired. 

As the morning comes around I open my window and feel a shiver roll down my spine. There hanging under the willow tree was Connor. He waved ever so slightly in the wind and had a smile on his face.

Billy came to me after having a nightmare, about an old man named Rick who lived in an old cabin down the block. Billy says in the dream, neighbor Rick brought him into the cellar, where five weird creatures were sitting, chanting. 


He described them as human shaped, but with deer skulls for heads. Their eye sockets were empty, but Billy could feel them hate him when they turned to look at him. 


I asked him what happened next, he broke down crying. I told him it was okay if he needed a break, and we could pick up next week. 


I got more nervous when my next client claimed to have a weird dream, involving a man named neighbor Rick.


She described the exact same dream as Billy, Rick taking her to the cellar, deer skull creatures in a circle. This time I asked her what they were circling, but she just mumbled “Rick” and broke down to tears just like Billy did. 


I had four more clients that day, and three of them described the exact name nightmare, although none could tell me what the creatures were circling. 


I knew which cabin they were talking about, they all described the abandoned pioneer cabin down by the outskirts of town. The sun was setting, so I drove there quickly, assuming some creep was squatting, scaring curious children. I had never dealt with repressed memories before, and probably should’ve just called the cops, but I had to see for myself. Maybe they all watched the same scary movie or something.  


The cabin reeked. It smelled the way people's garages do around hunting season, when they gut and hang their deer up. I got out my flashlight, gasping as it illuminated bloody symbols on the wall. 


Rushing back to my truck, I got my hunting rifle out, slamming the clip inside. Confident I could shoot if I needed to, I went down into the cellar. 


There knelt five man sized things, the deer skulls dragging on the ground as they bowed to a bloody figure. Slowly, the figure turned and sat up, and had the look of a grizzled, middle aged man. 


“They cursed me….” He mumbled, the creatures standing up. “Left me... without a body… but I got their ancestors to... see the truth….they brought me back.”  


I don’t know what those kids saw,  how any of this works, or what it means, but it brought an old, dead, apparently evil pioneer back from the grave. I escaped, rushing out the door, and contacted the families, but they couldn’t find their kids. 


I called the police, who finished their investigation by the morning. No sign of a man named Rick, but they did find the five missing kids. Or rather, their bodies, all tied together. 


Attached to all five of their necks were old deer skulls. "

She hadn't seen her little girl this happy since she and husband divorced. They shared custody and this week her daughter was at her dad's house to spend some quality time with him, they had went to the Zoo and Emily just couldn't stop talking about how fun it was, all the animals she saw and got to pet. She would facecall her mom often while at her dad's place and even though the older woman was usually tired from working it was never bad to hear her girl's voice as she was tod about the adventures she had gone to with her dad.

She had a difficult week, overtime at work, noisy neighbors, the feeling of loneliness her daughter left behind. But now she was glad she could talk to Emily. She was just tidying her bedroom when she got the call from the living room, she couldn't contain her excitement when she saw Emily waving at her trought her phone screen.

After a while she barely realized how fast time had passed, and she had been talking to Emily for more than an hour. She was about to say goodbye when she noticed Emily staring right behind her as if she had spot something.

""What is it sweetie?"" She asked, she little girl said ""Sarah's behind you!"" She smiled at her her daughter's perplexed expression. Of couse, Sarah, Emily's imaginary friend. The funny looking lady she would always talk about, about how she'd hid in her closet and they would play dolls together. ""Oh really? What is she doing there?"" the woman asked trying to sound serious, her daughter let out a confused grunt ""She looked at me and then left, weird.""

After tht Emily's dad came by and told her it was already past bedtime, she said bye-bye to mommy and went to brush her teeth as her parents talked to each other.

""She seems better now."" The woman said.

""Yeah, she's been smiling more often now. By the way, who's Sarah?""

""Oh, it's just her imaginary friend, she never pointed her out while I was present though . . . ""

Later that night, as the woman went to bed she soon felt annoyed when she saw her messy room as she told herself over and over she would tidy things up tomorrow.

Then she remembered . . . she did tidy her room earlier that evening. The feeling of dread crept trough her body as she looked around her bedroom.

Her closet door was open just a crack, and trough it she could see someone's eye looking directly at her."

It’s fucking freezing is what I mean. 

My balls have receded inside me like wrinkled turtle heads back into a shell. When I put my hands down to inspect the three testes – they’re tucked lumps, like the top of beaver heads unsure if they should pop from their holes. It’s still the warmest part of my body, so I keep my hands down near my genitals and walk faster to generate more heat and that’s when I first see her. 

She’s a dark shape against the white snow. There’s a fire in her crinkled eyes, thick with mascara that hang like bats from her lashes. Her black hair is like a frenzy of spirits tethered to her head; they whip crazily in the frosty wind like flickering onyx flames.

She’s in the embrace of a man whose back faces me as I approach along the sidewalk. He’s tall but very lean, so bony in fact that his shoulder blades press sharp against his jacket and I can’t imagine how it’s not tearing through the fabric. 

I admit, I’m jealous that this man should be nestled in the warmth of the silken woman. Her head is deep in his neck. There’s rapid movement, the most intimate kisses. 

She hears my feet, lifts her head, her mouth glistening, wetness from her chin going down her chest. She smiles. Then goes back to the neck and sucks deep like she’s underwater and sucking air through a straw. When I get closer, I see his neck and chest stretching outwards like a giant nipple for the bottle that is his body. She lifts him, sucking all the last drops of blood still clinging to his heart valves. 

And still she drinks! I imagine even the saliva from his mouth has dried up, his skin drained of moisture now dry and crinkled, his spinal fluid and brain juices receding towards her maw leaving a shriveled mind small as a walnut and a spine folded up, all the liquid of his body now in her.

She drops him, and he breaks in the snow, a billion pieces of human glitter.

The she smiles at me. The man is blowing away in the wind, has become snow, parts of him will probably be shaped into snow people tomorrow. 

She beckons me, and I go to her because she looks so warm and the night is cold, so cold that I don’t care if she breaks me into a billion bright pieces of winter glitter."

The plastic ones that shined a dull green-white? I was massively into space and sci-fi as a kid; I’d begged my parents to plaster the decorations all over, even the walls. My bedroom was *covered* in stars and when I turned off the light, it felt as if I was standing inside a constellation.

One night when I was ten, I saw a new star on my ceiling; a red star in the corner.

I got up from bed and crept over towards the corner in the dim light. When I got close, the red faded until it was gone.

The next night, the red star was back. And it brought friends. I woke up to see find my entire bedroom washed in a wet, scarlet light. My usual stars were missing, replaced by galaxies I didn’t recognize. As I laid in bed, stunned, the glowing shapes began to drift. I felt the slightest tug at my body, like when you hold two magnets apart. The pull danced across my skin in time to the orbits above.

I was experiencing the effects of gravity caught in a cage.

Then the stars returned to normal and no amount of poking could entice them to dance again. I went back to bed, wondering if it was all a dream. But every night for the next month, I would wake up to find my ceiling in motion. The tide of constellations was always different, a new solar system each time.

The night I turned eleven I woke up to see a single star on my ceiling. It was the red one, now in the center of the room. The star was much larger and brighter than ever before. Heat rolled off of it in greasy waves. I saw then that it was a tiny sun and it was...rotting. White boils and dry scars covered its surface. There was a *ripping* sound and I tried to scream but there was no oxygen.

Above me, the red star was opening, splitting in half to reveal a human eye. It was blue and it *hated* me, swelling until it covered the entire ceiling, pinning me to the bed with alien malice. I passed out. When I came to, the eye was gone and my room was once again filled with cheap, plastic toys that glowed green.

I tore all of the stars down that night. I stopped sleeping in my room entirely and had panic attacks whenever my parents tried to make me. Eventually, we moved. Twenty years and a few thousand therapy sessions later and I’d nearly put the Red Star out of my mind.

Until last night when I woke up to a familiar scarlet light in the corner. I’ve taken my wife and children from the house but I’m dreading tonight. If I look up into a ceiling full of stars, what might look back?"

There was a human shaped shadow pointing outside the window. I got scared so I just hid in my blanket (If I can't see you, you can't see me.) After a few minutes I looked again, the shadow was still there and again pointed outside the window. I hid in my blanket till I fell asleep.

To this day I still don't know what it's pointing at and still gives me chills everytime I remember this."

The customer had been clear about one thing: the new website was going online at the end of the week, and he better made sure it was ready.

Being a freelance web-developer could be tough, especially when you were buried under unrealistic expectations and a list of ever-changing features.

He hadn’t slept in days. All he’d been able to do was to nod off for a few hours at his desk.

He wasn’t sure how many cups of coffee he’d drank today.

Hell, he wasn’t sure about a lot of things anymore. This entire job was messing with his head.

“Freaking hell,” he cursed as yet another memo arrived in his inbox.

There was no freaking way he’d make it if things kept up like this. Yet, what was he supposed to do? He needed the damned money.

And so, after a few more minutes of resting, he continued his work.

He was just trying to wrap his head around a certain PHP-function and the resulting dynamic Html-block when he heard something.

For a moment the house was quiet but then heard it again, the creaking of a door.

“Daddy, come quick,” his daughter called out from down the hallway.

In an instant, he was off his chair and out of the room. Yet, for a moment, the strangest feeling washed over him. Something about this felt wrong.

Yet, when he saw no hint of Clara and the wide-open door of her room, he pushed the feeling aside.

“Clara?” he called out but got no answer.

When he entered, the room was freezing, and the window was wide open. The window, why was it open?

Quick steps led him to it, but when he stared outside, nothing was out of the ordinary.

“Clara?” he called out again, but there was no hint of her. The bed was empty, so was the closet and the rest of the room.

He’d just crouched down to look under the bed when he heard it again.

“Daddy, come quick.”

It sounded exactly like before.

Sweat broke out all over his body as the strange feeling came back. This time he knew what it was.

Clara was with her grandparents. Marie had taken her to spend the week at their place so William could finish his project undisturbed.

Slowly, his entire body trembling, he turned to where the voice had originated from.

What he saw was a disgusting, spidery creature. Its limbs were too long, too damn long. Two of them were still holding on to the ceiling where the thing must’ve been until now. 

Its head was nothing but a skull with paper-thin skin stretched over it.

Multi-faceted eyes focused on him, and when the abomination saw William’s terror, it giggled.

It’s grinning face shot forward and came to a halt mere inches in front of his own.

“Daddy, let’s play,” it whispered in his daughter’s voice."

Every sound, no matter how small, creates a beautiful melody. Of course, not all sounds are equal. The louder and more emotion filled a sound is, the greater the music it makes. For years, I’ve been searching for the greatest song of all.

I flip idly through the stack of envelopes as I pad slowly across the lawn, the dry grass crunching under my slippers. Sirens blare in the distance as I make my way towards the house. The front door opens with a click, and I’m met with a blast of freezing air rushing out into the heat of the day. I hurriedly step inside and close the door, trapping the cold once more. My little angels are right where I left them - sprawled on the couch, cartoons playing on the television. I watch them for a moment, smiling. They seem so at peace. Then the shaking starts.

The urge grows, buzzing in my mind like a swarm of flies. It grows and grows. It’s all I can think of. I need to- I need it- I need- My shaking hands scatter the envelopes across the floor. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters right now. I rush to the hallway, my breaths coming in short, fast gasps. The moment I lay my hands on the door handle, my heart rate slows. I open the door, casting light on the dusty steps leading below. I shut the door and make my way down, trusting my memory as I carefully reach for each step. Once my feet find solid floor, I reach blindly through the air, sighing with relief as my hand bumps into a cord. I pull it, and the garage lights up, revealing her.

The love of my life sits there, wide eyes watching me as I slowly walk closer. Her wedding ring still gleams on her finger, although it’s beauty is marred by a dark stain. ‘Why are you doing this?’ Her voice is raspy, broken. Tears fill her eyes, pooling over and leaving clean trails in her otherwise stained cheeks. She tugs uselessly at the rope binding her to her chair. Her gaze is unfocused and full of terror. ‘What did you do to them?’ Her voice cracks, and she begins to sob. The sound is beautiful. ‘What did you do to our children?’ Her voice rises to a shriek, and she glares at me, suddenly filled with rage. Her bleeding hands, once used to play elegant melodies on her piano, grasp feebly at the rope as she struggles. I ignore her attempts and turn to where I keep my tools. As I return with a small knife and first aid kit, she begins to scream, crying at the top of her lungs, as if that would be enough to get through the soundproofing. I smile and lean in, ready to begin my work. ‘You’ve always said we’d create beautiful music together.’"
kevt6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kevt6i/a_childrens_story/,A Childrens Story,17,6,1608204666.0,"It is a calm night. So calm that even the air seems silent. In a small hospital in kansas, only meant to hold 10 patients, lays a woman, her name is Sara. In front of her stands nurse , her nametag says Nurse Law. The nurse asks ""do you need anything?""

Sara calmly says ""no, my needs are through""

Nurse Law is taken aback by this but leaves to get some ice chips , not knowing what else to do.

As she leaves, Sara begins to scream in pain as she begins to have contractions. Nurse Law runs back trying to aid sara, but the door slams in her face. She calls for help as she continues to try and open the door, screaming, ""Ms. Sara is there somebody in there with you?""

Sara's screams grow louder and louder, as a storm has begun to blow heavily outside. The small head of the baby has begun to protrude from within Sara just as help arrives. Managing to hold the door ajar with much force, Nurse law pushes her head through and sees the baby's head is almost entirely free, but she notices the head is moving in a almost deliberate jerking manner, if it didnt go against everything that made sense, she might have believed the infant was biting his way out of his mother, either way she was much too focused on providing aid and Sara's screams grew louder still. As nurse Law attempts to squeeze her shoulder through, a bolt of lightning hits the window beside Sara, and the nurses are all blown back and the door closes again.

With the lights blown out, the nurses stand up in the darkness, shaking themselves off from their fall. They slowly open the door, afraid of what they might see on the other side. The door opens, and they see Sara, laying on the hospital bed, blood covering the bottom of her night gown and trailing to the floor, and at the end of the trail, lies her baby, a boy, blood covering his mouth, an aware look in his eyes, and not a tear in sight."

In my family everyone has emotional and psychological problems, and it's just normal to them really at this point. Being on medication is seen as normal and anyone who isn't is seen as an outsider. 

Even the kinds of doctors, psychologists and therapists my parents go to see all have psychological and emotional problems. Anyhow I have no emotional and psychological problems and that's seen as unusual and weird. They kept sending me to see this therapists who asking me questions about how and why I don't have any psychological or emotional problems. 

I kept saying that this was the way I was born and at first he would show me videos of people being tortured and hurt to try and scar me forever, but I was still fine. Then the therapists took me to places so that I could witness people being hurt and other people who leed horrid lives as a way of scarring me. 

When both techniques didn't leave me with any emotional and psychological problems, the therapist told me that he has no choice but to do horrible things to me, so that I become like my family. I stopped going to therapy and my parents are angry and disappointed. To be honest though this whole thing of trying to treat me for not having any emotional or psychological problems is actually starting to effect me. So I might actually end up like them in the future any how, maybe that was there plan all along? "

My rusty vehicle starts to slip on the wet road, I'm doomed. I try to hold tightly on the steering wheel but it isn't helping. All these sharp turns scare me as I frantically zoom around the corners. I hear a noise behind me as the lights in my car shut off.

I am in pitch darkness with no noise but my faint motor. I feel a sharp object lightly placed on my neck. The sound of the motor fades as I hear the hiss of tyres and the sound of a raspy voice whispering in my ear.

“Never again…” The blood squirts right out of my neck as I try to focus on something but in pitch black this doesn't work. I'm scared as my eyes close and the last thing I hear is that same sentence whispered again.

I try to let out some form of last words. Help me. Please. Stop. But it is barely audible and sounds more of a Help-- ple-- op. I black out."

Tim was grumpy after an extra long day from school (Chemistry lab was killing his GPA) and almost didn’t notice the absence of caution tape on the elevator frame. That was new. The ancient transport was still brown and rusted from age, but the shiny tape and sign were gone. Whoever had removed the warnings had done a poor job, as there were sticky outlines of adhesive that had been roughly torn off. Still, if the elevator was functioning, that was a win for the sweating Tim. He pressed the greasy UP button and bounced on his toes, hopeful.

A loud chugging sound, accompanied by a screech of metal shearing on metal echoed in the apartment lobby. Tim, alarmed, took a couple of steps back. *Did he just break it again?* The rusted doors were vibrating slightly, but finally they groaned open like a dam breaking.

Tim waited politely on the side for the occupants. Then he screamed and tripped backward, away from the doors.

A boy about Tim’s age walked out. His outfit was old school, a retro T-shirt with a pixel spaceship blasting aliens and faded high-water jeans. His clothes were bloodstained and torn, the exposed skin punctured, dripping purplish blood. That wasn’t the reason for Tim’s scream.

*His head*, Tim thought, *his head was all wrong*. 

The boy’s skull had been smashed open. Thick, pasty brain was dripping out of the boy’s left ear, red cheek flesh peeled back and exposing streaks of bone. Blue eyes, attached by their retinas, drooped lazily down onto a printed alien, wiggling slightly. Tim whimpered and retched, as the teeth from the walking corpse were enamel shards, obliterated beyond recognition. 

The corpse lifted what remained of his face and formed what could have been a smile. It pointed a finger at the elevator and shook his ruined head. It started walking down the hall, away from Tim. 

Tim kept his eyes on the figure until it turned the corner. Then, he walked slowly toward the elevator’s entrance, searching for the apparition. He peeked at the entrance, sweating heavily.

A pitch black opening, an opening that absorbed all light. Tim couldn’t see the back of the elevator. He couldn’t see any functioning buttons. His eyes did not adjust to this darkness. Tim entered the frame of the entrance and looked down. There was absolutely nothing, no floor, no cables, no maintenance panels. The elevator seemed to open into nothingness, a doorway to a black hole.

A gentle push from behind startled Tim, and he barely managed to catch himself in the metal frame. It was a good thing too, as he had almost been forced through the opening. He stuck his head out and peeked down, straining to see anything.

Tim didn’t see the descending elevator rushing downward at a breakneck speed, and his last sensation was the jagged, teeth-like edge of the transport crushing the back of his skull."

I put them on. They were tight, scratchy, but that was to be expected - after all, quality takes revenue, and damn Nicholas Cage pants? Not exactly *in demand.*

I slipped em on, snapped a pic, sent it to my pals. I got all the usual cheap laughs - *Oh my god, I can't believe you actually spent money on that - so extra - AHAHAHAHAH -* and my all-time favorite, the multi-paragraph keyboard smash.

But it was a short-lived glory, as they always are, and I set down my phone and spent a moment regretting my life decisions. Then I tried to pull them off.

Feeling my skin tear was a pain like nothing I'd ever felt before. It tugged, and blood began to show, staining Nick's face. Poor guy had a regular nosebleed.

I pushed through the pain, gritted my teeth. Still no dice. It just-- wouldn't--come *off--*

Finally, I had to give up. I'm just an ordinary guy. I don't have the pain tolerance for this shit.

Nobody believed me, either. It was so strange. I would even show them - *pull, pull* \-- but even as they tugged on my legs like ropes at recess, they didn't believe me. Almost supernatural.

After two weeks, I started to feel drained. Pale. Lifeless. I moped around, stopped going to school stopped leaving the house, marinating in my own sweat, my own shit. More discord threads. More online shopping. My parents hardly even raised an eyebrow.

Reddit, finally. I stopped here after a long, long haze of threads. Nobody believing me. Nobody trusting me. *So much laughter.*

I can't go on like this.

If you guys can't help, then it's not on you. I did what I could. Bummer it was the fucking Nicholas Cage pants that did me in, instead of a bear attack or motorcycle accident or something cool.

We hope you enjoy all that the Northwoods of Wisconsin has to offer. There are some rules you should follow during your stay, and for your convenience we have them listed right here:


1.) When fishing in the lake, do not pull up anything that feels too heavy to be a fish. They are not a big catch, and they will drag you down with the rest of them.

2.) If you see hunters with no face wearing blaze orange, shoot them on site. Do not let them get close enough to touch your face. If you accidentally shoot a normal hunter, we will compensate you for your stay.

3.) The bodies in the cellar are not real, don’t call the police. They won’t be able to see them, and they’re sick of “prank calls”

4.) The boat can be used as much as you want, although blood stains cannot be removed. Avoid them as much as possible, as they are contaminated with lymes disease. 

5.) Cook what you catch/kill, and burn any remaining garbage. Any wasted food will attract the local bears. The bears are generally docile, but if you see any with human eyes, do not try to speak to them, no matter what they say.

6.) If the power goes out, do not panic, but do not light any candles or use any flashlights. The wendigo that cut the power cannot see in the dark.

7.) Bring a tent and supplies for an overnight trip if you hike near the property. If you wander off the trail, it’ll be at LEAST one night before you find your way back.

8.) The local cult is annoying, but generally harmless. They believe in some fish god that lives in the lake, which is also annoying but harmless. If they’re grilling out, go ask to join them. The meat they make is fantastic. 

9.) There is no reception this far up north, any calls or texts that you get on your phone should be ignored. 


Enjoy your stay at Rohr village! We hope you leave feeling refreshed and filled with the spirit of the woods!"

And yes students are required to wear the plague doctor uniform but the mask is optional.

And the employees here are required to teach kids about the pestilence and our culture.

Math teaches about normal math stuff, History teaches about the history of the pestilence and how this plague started, Science teaches you about how to dissect living and nonliving things. With optional classes like cooking and Engineering.


And in case you are wondering I am not going to talk about our founders or anything like that.

And now thanks to COVID 19 our school is growing larger, and becoming more powerful the ever.

By the way when we pledge to our flag we put our arms in an x and move our wrists backward touching our fingertips with our other hand. It is like making a diamond shape with your hands, And at the end, we say “Death to the pestilence”.

Also, we don’t give homework cause we don’t the student parents know about our mission.

To destroy the pestilence at all cost.

And any talk about the pestilence outside of the classroom or making jokes about like calling it “The devils fart” will automatically leave to expulsion, and we take bullying very seriously cause it to show sign of the pestilence...

I am typing this to ask you about joining our school. No, it isn’t a school anymore it is a nation now.

At first, there was a camp. 36 people become 20. 20 become 10. 10 became 5.

But oh, this Beast was real. The Beast hunted them all. The Beast killed them all.

""The Beast had to kill and eat, otherwise it would be dead.""

More importantly, my mom hates books.

""Ghastly things that kill your head. I don't know why anybody would even want to look at them."" She'd say, as she'd scroll through her tenth Buzzfeed article of the day.

I guess, with a child's natural instinct to rebel against their parents, it would make sense that I'd be drawn to the very things that she despised.

Now, when I say that I love books, I LOVE books. My pastimes consisted of nothing much other than digging into a read in the library, or finding the next read in the library.

That's when she came to hate me.

""Get your nose out of that! Do you want to be boring?"" She'd ask me, as she'd grab it from my hands, and tear the pages apart, one by one, not even caring that it was a loan.

But I kept on reading, the passion for literature burned brighter in me than she could hope to stomp out, as it threatened to turn the house into flames.

And it did, on two separate nights.

The first, she finally had had enough of my incessant insistance on grabbing something, anything, and burying my face into it.

She heaved up from in front of the tv, and headed to my room. Despite my pleading, she grabbed as many books as she could off of my shelf, and started to rip.

They fell in tatters onto the floor, the paper littering the ground, until it became impossible to step foot in my bedroom without planting yourself into some pages.

That was when my relationship with myself and my mother fully deteriorated. And the second night started to be planned.

I had picked up more than simple stories at the library. The old lady that ran the place had a bit more to her than at first glance, but I guess you'd probably be able to tell, the nose and warts being so conspicuous on her face.

I walked into the sitting room, holding the fattest book I could find, and threw it at my mother. Look at that slob, scarfing down a tv dinner while channel-surfing, I'm practically doing everyone a favour here.

Once she realized that I had thrown the book, she chased me into my room, but I was ready.

I chanted the spell once she had burst in, and it all came into action.

Books everywhere. Thick tomes started to fly out of my shelves, towards my mother. They circled her, nipping her with the edges. The ends fashioning themselves into sharp and jagged teeth.

And then one bit, and then all of them bit.

They chomped, biting off massive chunks of flesh from her arms and legs, then her torso. Her screams starting and then being deafened just as quickly, as bits of her skin hung off the hardback copies. She collapsed to the floor, as they all got their fair share.

While and after this was happening, I sat down, and read a book.

I hate my mother. But more importantly, I love reading."

I've catched certain behaviors from the corner of my eye, I'm scared to show attention, I don't want to let him know that I'm aware of him spying me from the darkness, that when I woke up in the middle of the night, I pray to be my imagination because sometimes I hear the faintiest sound of paws, just a pair of paws walking around the house, as if an animal was walking in two legs only.

Suddenly I hear a giant sound booming from around me, sounds like a hinge almost. Suddenly the very small container I’m in is moving being jostled and thrown with every move it makes. My box is slammed on the table leaving me hurt, exhausted and curious. 

The box is shaking, the lid the lid, someone is opening the lid. Hopefulness fills me thinking I have some chance at survival. The lid is removed and the lights are blinding. I look up to see a family. A family? Yes there is the mother and father and even a little boy and girl. Thankful relief washes over me. Until I see it.

All of them even the kids holding shining silver knives. The father cuts into me. Immense searing burning pain is all I feel. These mad people! They spread my insides across a surface leaving me to die out slowly.

She considered the bathtub her happy place. It was here that she could calm down, take a step back, and spend the early evening hours with a good book.

Today had been especially bad. With Christmas around the corner, online sales were skyrocketing. To say Cindy’s department was buried in work was an understatement.

It was already early evening when she finally made it home.

After a quick meal, she decided to soak her tired body for an hour or two. After picking out one of her many bath bombs, she undressed and watched as the water was transformed into a swirling, bubbling mess. When the hot water came to a rest, it had been transformed into a deep, starry blue.

Descending into the bath was heaven. At first, the heat stabbed at her skin, but after a little while, it changed into a soothing, pleasant feeling.

Cindy leaned back, closed her eyes and for a while she just lay there, enjoying the heat and sweating away all the workday’s worries.

She’d half drifted off when she heard running water. She instinctively thought of the drain. Had she accidentally opened it?

Her hand reached out for the drain stopper and turned, but it didn’t move at all. For all she knew, it was still closed.

Maybe it was something in the pipes? Or maybe her next-door neighbor had let in an evening bath of their own.

She laughed a little and wondered what kind of person her ‘bath friend’ might be.

“Well, hope you’re having fun,” she mused on.

It was right at this point that bath water started bubbling and Cindy noticed hair in the water. Not her own, she thought in disgust. At first, it was only a few here and there, but soon, thick strands came up. Right at that time, the strange sound from the drain started again.

The pipes, there’s something wrong with the pipes. All these disgusting hairs, it had to come up from down the drain! In disgust, she cringed back from the drain, tore off strands that clung to her, and finally decided to abandon the bath.

With her hands on the side of the tub, she suddenly heard another disturbingly long gurgle.

Then something emerged from the water in front of her, right where the drain was. At first, it was only hair, a giant, wet ball of hair, but then she saw something in-between. It was a disgusting, wrinkled thing, much too thin to be a human being.

“Oh, yes, I’m having fun,” the thing cackled in a high-pitched voice.

Still in shock, Cindy felt a bony hand close around her ankle and a moment later she was pulled underwater and eventually yanked down the drain."

I remember the first jacket and coat that I had freed, it was being worn by a man who was standing up straight and had his back to me. Also I only free coats and jackets that want to be freed. He was talking to another man until his coat started to move on its own and started pointing in all directions and I ran towards the coat hoping to free it. The other guy ran off. 


I took the coat off the man who was now on the floor and his coat was full of blood, and whenever I free coats and jackets there is always blood. Then another time I saw a woman wearing a coat and she had her back to me. She was talking to another woman and then suddenly her coat started to move and point in all directions on its own wanting to be freed. I ran towards her coat and she ended up on the floor. The other person she was talking too had ran off, and again her coat was full of blood as I took it off her. 


Recently though I did something different and when I saw a coat being worn by a man who had his back to me, he was talking to someone which seemed like an argument. Then his coat started moving and pointing in all directions but then the coat started pointing in only 1 direction. The guy wearing the coat fell to his knees and the other guy ran off. Then when I went up to the man wearing the coat pointing in 1 direction, I realised he had been stabbed from the front which is why his coat was bloodied up. The man died from his stab wounds and this was the same with the other people whose coats I freed from, as they all died from stab wounds.

However, now that this game was over, I snatched a tissue from the box on my desk and gave my nose a good blow.

Nothing came out. All that happened was the pain got worse, and the pressure was so great now I could feel the pulsations.

So, what's a man to do? I took my index finger and thumb and rummaged around up there, instantly finding the cause of my nasal stuffiness: a booger the size of a walnut, lodged tight into my right nostril. I tried to get my finger around it, but I just seemed to be pushing it further in. The thing was ancient and crusty as hell. I didn't want it inside me for another second.

After a few minutes I got some tweezers. ""Right then, booger."" I said out loud, finally gripping it. ""Prepare to meet your maker!"" I tugged, and tugged. Then I yanked it full-force.

I examined the monstrous red glob captured in the metal pincers, oozing lumpy matter onto the carpet, and immediately felt light-headed.

A few years ago, tauntauntom had just been through a rough divorce from their high school sweetheart. Their best friend had taken to distracting them by taking long road trips. One morning, they were on their way to Carlsbad, New Mexico when they paused alongside a river dam. They were drinking cider and snacking when the pair decided to explore the dried river bed. It was obvious that they weren’t the first ones to go trekking through the riverbed. The pair could see human, canine, and feline footprints in the mud. 

They then recall starting to feel an odd sensation, like they were being watched. Their friend caught the writer’s attention and called them over. There was a bone in the ground - what they now believe was a spinal cord. At first, they thought it was a beef or pork bone of some kind. They continued looking around the river bed when they found a strange rust-colored rock sticking out from the sand. When they got closer, they realized it was a half-buried little girl’s shoe. The Reddit user stepped back and ran forward, preparing to kick the shoe. Suddenly, they heard a little girl’s voice shout “No! Don’t, please!” They looked around but didn’t see anyone besides themselves, and their friend. The friend asked why they stopped and they replied “Didn’t you hear that little girl?”. Both confused, they decided to shrug it off and continued on their way. Meanwhile, the feeling that someone was watching them grew stronger. A few minutes later, they spotted another bone. 

Now, they began to get scared. The bone was clearly human. The friend called the non-emergency police number for Carlsbad, and they reported what they saw.

One week later, they received a call from their friend that the Carlsbad Police had called to report the bones they found were indeed human. During the investigation, the two were questioned and eventually informed that the rust-colored rock actually wasn’t a rock at all, but the shell of a pickup truck that had disappeared along with the family of three it had been carrying: a man, a woman, and their daughter. It made the Reddit user think back to the girl’s shoe sticking out of the mud, and the voice they heard. Could the little girl have spoken directly to them?"

I remembered his house better than him. I hated it. His midday living room scared me more than any midnight attic. “He’s just an art collector,” my mother would say before she was ready to tell me the truth.

One of his friends came up to me after the burial. She delivered all the lines with natural grace. “I’m sorry for your loss.” “This must be difficult.” “He’s in a different place.” When she finally got around to asking if she could come to the house to get a book that she had lent my uncle back, I told her that she was welcome to any of his creepy junk.

She arrived the next day. I let her inside and gestured to a painting hanging on the wall. A half–horseshoe crab, half-primate entity lies on its back caught in the boughs of a bare, wind-lashed oak. The being lifts its uncanny face to the sky, and a pale aurora outglows the stars. Its mouth parts to utter a whimper that I can almost hear. “Did he ever tell you why he had that?” I asked.

“These are the perils that prevent a flatman from completing—.”

“The coiled ascent,” I finished. My mother had belonged to the Coiled Ascent.

“I was hoping that she had told you about us.”

“You knew my mom?”

“Let’s look around. There are some old pictures that might interest you.”

She unsettled me, but I was curious. She was the only living person who really knew my mom. My father had died before I was born, and my mother without telling me how she and her brother had spent their twenties.

We eventually found a box in the attic with a bunch of pictures from the seventies. In one, my mother, my uncle, and she are sitting around a Parker Brothers ouija board. They’re wearing bell bottoms and laughing. They look like they’re just goofing around. In another, my uncle is writing “FLATMAN UNCOIL” backwards on a mirror in blood. I could see why we had moved.

“So my uncle was the true believer?” I asked.

She laughed. “When your uncle ran off to college, he was empty. There was a scramble for his soul. If his first roommate had been Christian, he’d be at a Bible study right now. He just wanted to make friends. Your mother wasn’t lying when she called him a collector. This house was a museum, not a temple. The true believer was your father.”

“My father?”

She handed me a picture. “He was our photographer, but you mother sneaked a few candids in. Why don’t you take another look at that painting?” She led me back to the living room. That thing had my father’s face. She put her arm around me. “It takes more than one generation to uncoil,” she said. I whimpered."

That's how it starts, insomnia, whatever you do you just can't get to sleep. Pills don't work, booze doesn't either. I've heard that they've been giving people general anaesthetic's in a bid to protect important brain functioning. The thing is, anaesthesia isn't real sleep, just sort of puts you out for awhile. Insomnia progresses to delirium and hallucinations. God knows what they're seeing but the patients in the advanced ward barely ever stop screaming. Their eyes rolling around in their skulls, occasionally they seem to regain some semblance of their former selves and they'll lock eyes with you. It happened with one lady, I've never seen fear like that in a person, she had tears rolling down her cheeks from her bloodshot eyes.

 If they're not anaesthetised they become manic and aggressive, harming themselves and anyone nearby. We had one man, he'd been in a week or so, hard to say when he first began showing symptoms, after all, who really notices a few nights of bad sleep these days? Anyway, he was drifting past delirium into full blown dementia, he kept banging his head against the wall, presumably trying to knock himself out. We had to restrain him, although he took out two orderlies in the process. We got him strapped to the bed and shot him up with thiopentone. He had already knocked out some teeth and split his scalp open. Others start biting, themselves and anybody else. We had one lady trying to tear this other ladies throat out, just chewing on her neck whilst pinning her to floor. 

They're calling it 'Contagious Insomnia', with some suggesting it might be a prion disease, a sort of Infectious familial insomnia. Others have suggested it might be a virus of some kind. If so the route of infection isn't clear. The issue of mortality is still up for debate as those that have died appear to have all either taken their own life or else have been killed following violent assaults. There have been a number of police shootings, one instance occurred after a man in an advanced condition began randomly stabbing people in the street and screaming incoherently. 

I just hope that they shoot me before I end up looking like the crying lady, or else I'll throw myself under a train. Still, I stare at the ceiling, I can't really remember when I slept properly anyway. As a nurse I didn't get much sleep anyway, I just hope I'm not spreading it to the patients or my colleagues. The streetlight is sending bars of light across my ceiling and the shadows cast are beginning to wave and move, the sound of the cars driving past my house is beginning to sound like voices saying my name. I glance at the clock, it's already 5:30 and I have to go to work in two hours."

Dave was sleeping in the passenger seat next to me, he drove the first half of the trip and I had nearly made it to the motel for the night. I was glad the two of us could find the time to enjoy the next few days. 

I hadn’t seen a car in a while but I was enjoying the solitude, I turned down the radio and just breathed the air wanting to enjoy some nature before reaching the town. 

After driving in silence for what felt like 30 seconds and I heard it; a scream. I slowed the car down and listened, there it was again. I shook Dave awake to make sure he heard it too and then came third time. He was fully awaken now, looking out into the dark. The car suddenly felt smaller, less safe, a little blip in the ocean of darkness. 

“What do we do?” Dave asked. 

I didn’t have answers. I looked at my phone, no reception. The scream came again, this time more desperate. 

“Maybe we should go look?” I couldn’t tell what was making that sound but it obviously needed help. 

“Maybe it’s a bat or a fox?” Dave asked hopefully. 

The scream rung out again, it was the only sound other than the leaves rustling in the wind. I went to exit the car but as I did Dave held me back.

“Remember what the motel people said when we booked the room. They told us not to stop in the wooded area. They said parasites might hop on board and make their way into town.” 

I stopped for a second what Dave said was true and I definitely didn’t want the car infested with fleas and ticks. But the scream came again even louder and before I knew it I was running towards it. I couldn’t keep driving without making sure no one was in danger. 

With Dave running behind me with a torch it didn’t take long to find the culprit. It really was a fox and it was fine just making dramatic sounds. I breathed a sigh of relief and we laughed. Dave was less amused. 

We hurried back to the car, it was getting late. 

“Wait before we going lets check for parasites.” said Dave. 

I shook my shirt and checked my pants. I checked Tom’s hair while Dave held the torch. We got back in the car and continued driving. Hopefully that was the last of the craziness and the three of us could enjoy the next few days."

One. Big. Happy. Family. Not a particularly wealthy or perfect one, but having everyone in one room was a blue moon situation so kathy treasured it.
The room fell quiet once again, the sound of cutlery bounced of every room in the rarely quiet house. 

Without warning, footsteps bellowed above them, from one side of the room to the other, causing the house to shake, everyone just stared at each other in confusion. Kathy looked too see if the cat was still in the room, to her dread it was chewing a potato and then it sank in ""has someone broken in?"" Her inner voice called.
Kathy knew she was going to have to look as she was the only adult and everyone else looked like they'd been put on pause. 

Outside her two kids room, the room with the invisible footsteps. Kathy opened the door without hesitation, ""Who could possibly be in here?"" The voice in her mind wondered.
No shock, nothing. Maybe just something fell off the shelves as the room was messy anyway, Kathy came down and calmed the even quieter room.

The sound of children, how peaceful they sleep,
I climb through their window, in there room I will creep,
My silence is hard but hiding is cheap,
The children the children, but only one I will keep,

Some people call if the BIBLE for short. Well, that’s nice and all, but there’s some key things they forgot to mention. Here’s a few quick tips to remember before and after you reach the pearly gates.

Pre-Heaven:

1. Be careful when you pray. They’re right, someone’s always listening. But it’s not your Heavenly Father seated on high. 

2. There is no “Hell.” Sounds great right? Hell is just a ploy to push everyone towards Heaven. More souls, more slaves. 

3. All pastors, priests, and rabbis are vessels of the Lord. Oh, you thought there were only three - the Holy Trinity? More like the Unholy Legion. 

4. Crucifixes aren’t a symbol of hope and forgiveness. They are a warning for disobedience. If He could do that to His own son, what would He do to you? 

5. So about communion...it really is someone’s blood and body. Who’s blood and body? No one really knows. 

Post-Heaven: 

1. It’s inevitable, but keep away from entering the gates for as long as possible. Through them, you will see your greatest fantasy. Entering them, you will live your greatest nightmare. Do not be fooled. Be prepared. 

2. Once you’re in, hide as quickly as possible. Your family will come and help you, and you’ll be excited to see a familiar face, so you may not notice subtle differences. However, you may notice that their voice is a little too perfect. You may notice that their joints pop and crack a little more than a normal human’s would. But the most telling sign is that the skin sags and drips off the bones. So I should correct myself, they are your family. Just what’s wearing their skin isn’t.

3. The Tree of Life sounds promising. But whose souls do you think give it life?

4. Despite following all these rules, you still won’t make it. But if you survive long enough, you might be able to do some good. I mean, I got you this letter right?"

I do not like one dream.

It is a lucid dream. 

They say the best ways to see if you are dreaming are to count your fingers, and read lines in a book. 

I like to read. 

I like to dream. 

I woke up. Lying in bed, I checked my phone when I heard a crash. 

Down the hall, on the left, take one right. My bathroom. I thought I might have left open a window. I did not. 

So I returned to my bed, feeling the sheets now icy cold, and climbed beneath the covers. Silently I waited. Waited for sleep. 

Waited for dreams. 

They did not come. 

I read instead. My favourite book right of the shelf. I heard a bang again. 

Down the hall, one the left, take one right. 

I stood up. The floor creaked. I walked to the bathroom. 

Down the hall, on the left take one right. 

I kept walking. I did not find my bathroom. It was gone. I thought I was dreaming so I stopped.  I drew my hand to my face and counted. 1 thumb and 4 fingers. All fine. I looked up when I saw the light change. She was there. In my not bathroom. Staring. 

I did not speak.  I could not. 

She reached out a hand. I began to run. I ran back to my hall, on the left, down the hall. Into my bed, and under my covers. 

I hoped I was dreaming. 

The lights flickered, seemingly in time with my heart. Badum, badum, badum. 
I peaked out. She was stood in the corner staring. She had no face, no eyes, no features. But she stared at my and she pierced my brain. My eyes began to tear. 

I blinked and she was gone. I heard the floor creak. She was there, closer reaching here hand to me, her cold fingers wrapping around me, freezing my bloo- 

I woke up. I heard a crash. I stood up. 

Down the hall, on the left, take a right. The hall was there. The lady was not. I walked back to bed. I tried to sleep. I could not. So I read. I could not. The words were jumbled, disfigured, and they seemed to grow taller and taller, until they looked like a shape, a face-

I woke up. I heard a crash. Down the hall on the left take a right. 

I picked up my phone. I wrote a message. My words are mumbling and blending. She is coming. 

I can only dream.  

You can only dream too. 

The faceless lady comes for you.

It keeps me from sleeping. In the absolute silence every tick is as loud as a bomb dropping. I can't reach it and I have no way of breaking it. Every second I'm reminded that there is no way out of here. It's been exactly 46 hours since I've been taken into the inside of this four walled, white, hell space.

Nobody has come to speak to me yet. I have no idea what's going on, or why I've been taken from my workplace in the middle of the day by men in suits at gunpoint.

I've received exactly two meals so far, delivered through a small opening at the bottom of the door. They were both bread on a napkin and a plastic cup filled with water.

It takes until hour 48 until I see another human being again.

Another man in a suit. Not one of the ones who took me, as far as I can tell. He opens the door and enters. He is armed with a baton.

""Stand,"" he orders.

I slowly get to my feet.

He continues, ""You're under suspicion of committing an act of terrorism.""

I stare at him. ""Excuse me? I'm what now?!"" I've never hurt a fly. Is this some kind of sick joke?

""72 hours ago we received a recording of you planting a bomb at the local airport.""

I don't understand what's happening. ""That can't be right. I was at work. Can I see the recording?""

The guard, a bit taken aback, doesn't deny me my request.

""Come with me."" He lets me exit the room. ""Down the hallway, last door to the left.""

He follows me silently and when we enter the dark room full of screens, he loads the footage he had referred to.

A woman who looks just like me, walks like me, dresses like me, is indeed planting a bomb inside a hangar. I'm in shock. ""But I was at work. How can that be possible?""

The guard turns to me and slowly a smile spreads across his lips. It scares me.

""You don't remember a thing, do you?""

I want all of this to go away. ""I was at work. I got up in the morning and went to the office!""

""You didn't. All of your coworkers confirmed you weren't present, which means the chip we implanted in your head works."" He holds out a contract and a consent form with my signature. ""Well done. And thank you for participating."""

The silence between the outcries of their argument covered by the lively jungle at their backs. Vanessa and Gert were the only ones still living through their plane crash leaving them washed up somewhere in the pacific. A few other passengers survived the crash only to succumb to their injuries. The conversation started off about what to do with the remains of the planes rations, Gert wanting to eat when hungry to maintain energy, Vanessa wanting to ration as long as possible. The exchange escalates to Gert screaming, “Why don’t we go explore what the island were stuck on has to offer, you scared bitch, instead of trying to make best use of the space in this box you can’t think outside of.” Vanessa had heard enough, starving and acting out of pure emotion she got up and started shaking Gert back and forth by her shoulder length curly red hair. Gert wasn’t going to take this, wrestling for a few minutes Vanessa had an impulse idea to end it. Sticking her leg out while simultaneously pushing her, she tripped Gert into the fire. Needing a second to realize what had happened Gert’s button up cotton sweater light up like a Christmas tree. Panicked she sprinted to the ocean. Vanessa followed her with remorse, she really didn’t wanted it to go that far. Gert returned from the water, got up in Vanessa’s face and proclaimed with an edge of certainty, “See you in hell.” Without a second thought she swiftly walked down the coast line without ever looking back. Vanessa returned to the fire staring at it for hours as she tried to focus her thoughts. Vanessa survived another 3 months on the island watching the fire, rebuilding her shelter that would always get destroyed in even a mild storm, and trying to hold off eating as long as possible. She never ventured more than 100 feet into the jungle preferring to lay wait on the beach where it felt safe. Some days she wouldn’t move at all. Vanessa’s friends and family back home had given up looking for her, few would admit it but they were better off without her. After a day of laying by the fire she tried to get up but was far too weak and flopped down cracking her head on a rock. Paralyzed from lack of energy, low spirit and no reason to live she bled out and died right there. Gert discovered her 2 months later, letting out a devilish grin upon seeing her after emerging from the jungle she’d conquered."

The 1500s had little going on for fae, so she settled to dancing and singing. As she danced, the sun danced with her, its warm hands joining hers, a waltz through the woods. She danced peacefully, every time her foot hit the ground, the flowers seemed to brighten a little, seeming younger and younger. 

At noon she heard a woodman enter the forest. They often came, surveying the area. But they never cut down the trees. This woodman tripped and fell, shouting out in pain. He looked up and locked eyes with the girl, and gasped. He then went to yell out again, not in pain, but in warning that fae were in the woods. The fae walked over to him, pulling him up, shushing him before he could yell out. However, he did not make anymore attempts to call out, instead whimpering as he stood on his injured leg. 

“What is your name, fae?” he asked, scrunching his face up as he tried to stay comfortable.

“Adina. That is my name. What is yours, O woodman?” her face was young, and she looked no more than a child, with light translucent wings sprouting from her back. The man scoffed, like a parent catching their child lying.

“I am no fool, I know not to give my name to a fairy.” 

“Ah, so you are not. You are a fool for tripping over.” She bent down, sitting on her toes, before holding her hands on the man’s leg. He went to say something, but her hands were cool and soft and he could feel his leg get better and better, and soon it felt better than when he came into the woods. She got back up, leading the man into a dance, twirling around in the light, before laying him down gently on a moss-covered log. He thanks her, but his wary look betrays his gratitude. 

The fae stops, looking at him, considering his face. Flowers sprout and grow at her feet. When she realises, she moves, and doesn’t stop until she reaches a particular tree. She grabs onto a low branch before reaching into a hole, grabbing something for the woodman. She walks over to him and reveals to him her item. An intricate dagger made of pure silver. She takes it and plunges it into his chest, and he screams out. As he splutters out begs, she smiles and grabs him, taking his limp corpse around the woods, leading her waltz. The sun hides away, rain showering down. A few weeks later, a body would be found with flowers growing through its chest, and a smile on its face."

I had asked her why her hands were slick, as they slid over my bony limbs. I’m blind, so I can’t affirm that it is paint, but it stings, and in conjunction with the wet noise, I frighten that my skin is sliding off with each pass of her hand. 

“Settle down, you’re all right old man,” she teases me. She laughs. “We need more,” she says. She walks away and there’s a ripping noise like a plant being uprooted, followed by sounds of that plant being ground into a pulp, but it’s too chunky to be a plant isn’t it, too much other stuff squishing around in that slop. I get the horrible image of a limp creature bashed against stone – 

The bloody globules of an aborted baby plunking into a porcelain toilet, a line of humans stepping off a cliff and sinking atop each other on the ground below, the ocean frothing in a disrupted rhythm as an immense beast yields its confinement to the unseen depths so that it may stand atop humankind.  

Widespread feticide, suicide, annihilation. These are just noises inside my head right now, but very soon they could be reality. 

I hear her carrying a bucketful of paint which she sloshes over my head, burning sensation running down. Get’s into my eyes. They blink rapid, twitching, and soon I can see.

We’re in a cave, her home. It’s smells like iron and sin. Kneeling nearby is her, she’s masking her face with the same paint that she lathered me, and now rubbing a handful through her gums and teeth. “Just a little beauty regimen,” she snickers. 

She is beautiful. Even though she’s covered in crimson paint.

The metal pot she’s scooping out of, there’s a toddler’s arm and leg hanging over the lip like they were trying to get out. I recognize a bracelet I made for my niece, wrapped around her gray wrist.

My legs that haven’t moved in a decade, tremble and rattle in their chains. My wrinkles smooth out, gray eyes and hair turn brown, my sense awaken.

And I hear distant screaming. My family. 

“Where’s the book?” the painted lady asks. She means the one that invites the beast.   

I don’t tell her, so she removes pieces of me. Before I can die, she runs out to where she’s keeping my family, tears down the molecules of one of them, and showers me in their youth and health, then she bathes me in boiling water, but before I can die a melted puddle, she goes out and breaks my heart even more. 

Over and over. But I never reveal where I hid the dark book. 

We’re close to the ocean, I can hear the distant waves lapping at the shore, the heartbeat of a beast in waiting. I wait as well, for the day that I finally break. I just know it’s not today."

“Shhh, I think I heard something,” I whispered back, hands shaking as I gripped the banister at the top of the old stairwell. 

*Creeeaaakkk*

“I told you it wasn’t a smart idea to go to that weird cabin all by yourself!” Natalie mumbled. I rolled my eyes. I came here to finish my long overdue book, and this spot was promised to be quiet, remote, nothing to break my focu—

“Did you hear that?” I hissed through a clenched jaw. There was definitely someone in the kitchen. I squeezed the rail and audibly gulped. 

“Seriously Mel, just get out of there, I’m calling the pol-”

“No!” I shouted. “No police!” 

That’s the last thing I needed right now. I took another step, ignoring the old floorboards this time; I needed to act fast. 

“Hey! Is anyone down there? I uh, I have a gun!” I tried to speak with authority, but I knew it came out squeaky. 

*Silence*

After a quick internal pep talk, I bolted down the last five steps and rounded the corner to the kitchen.

My wide eyes frantically searched the dimly lit area, while the light from my screen made my shadow dance proudly upon the wall, almost as if it were taunting me. 

The kitchen was empty.

My anxiety was really getting the better of me. Afterall, this was the first time I had ever done something like this; it’s normal to be nervous, right? 

When I got to my bedroom I sighed; this story was not going to write itself and my inspiration was slowly decaying away. 

I reached into my pocket and retrieved my phone. “Hey Talie, I —“

“Ugh fine, go write your stupid novel,” she mumbled. 

I gave her a sarcastic smile as I hovered my finger over the button to end the call. “Thanks for understanding,” I winked, just before the phone slipped out of my hand. 

I groaned and looked at the floor. Where did it go? I blindly felt around until my fingers found it tilted up against a chair leg. 

“Fuck, sorry. Ok bye,” I laughed as I brought the screen back up to my face. 

Natalie looked terrified. 

“Mel, listen to me. You need to get out of the room! Right now!” She whispered shakily, in a barely audible tone. 

I looked at her confused. 

“With tears beginning to form, she mouthed “there’s someone under your bed.” 

I froze, heart sinking as my eyes glanced behind me. Then I heard my friend dialing the police from her landline and my pulse quickened. Would I have time to escape? Was this the end for me? 

Pulling the cotton from my nose, I let the stench of regret fill me. 

I took one last look beneath my bed and sighed. I knew I should have buried that body yesterday."

kdsbn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kdsbn9/apoptosis/,Apoptosis,2834,100,1608059919.0,"Apoptosis is programmed cell death. It’s a regulated mechanism in multicellular life that allows for new cells to grow, when the old cells wear themselves out, or outlive their usefulness. 


It is also the main reason life is temporary. Continued apoptosis leads to DNA mutation, cell shrinking, and DNA fragmentation. In short, apoptosis is why life ages. 


However, stopping apoptosis is a double edged sword. Cancer is caused when a cell does not undergo apoptosis, it ignores programmed death and keeps functioning, keeps dividing, leading to more and more cells that never die. 


Ironically, this cell immortality leads to death for the organism. 


It took scientists decades of genetic research, but they figured out the secret to eternal life. 


They managed to make cells that stop undergoing apoptosis. In short, that person does not age after they are resequenced. They also managed to stop those same cells from undergoing mitosis, the process of cell division, which prevented tumors or cancerous cells from developing in the body. 


Humanity had created the cure from death, their cells would never decay on their own. The perfect balance of cellular stability had been found. 


It’s human nature to be selfish, there’s no cure for that. The wealthy elite class in America bought exclusive rights to the DNA sequencing, and in return, the insurance companies jacked up the price to an unreasonable amount of money. In return, the rich elite had to make people rely more on what they had to offer. 


Nothing was done about climate change, the ozone layer, or reliance on finite resources. In fact, those problems worsened over time as the elite rushed to make enough money to live forever. Sunlight became piercing, ocean levels wiped out most cities, millions of species the world's ecosystem needed became extinct. The planet slowly became inhospitable to anyone who could not afford advanced shelters. In other words, the now immortal elite class. 


The elite wanted this cure so badly they forced the scientists to rush production. Which meant they skipped clinical trials. 


There was a major side effect to this sequencing. One that scientists only realized after the elite made this cure impossible for the common man to get. 


If cells don’t age and replace themselves, illness can’t be cured, as the body cannot produce any more T-cells to fight off germs. Any injury would become permanent; a broken arm or leg would never repair itself, a concussion would never go away, cuts or bruises would continue to bleed indefinitely. 


The team of scientists, tired of years of being ignored over their fields, discovered this when testing on rats. They looked outside at their dying, flooding world, and smiled. 


There is no natural karma in real life. We have to make our own. 


The rich elite would live forever in a dead world, always starving, never healing, always in pain. 


There’s no cure for greed. 


But there can be justice."

It happened 7 days ago….. I'm sitting at home on my couch watching the news reading up that Biden just won the election when it began to happen that's what I heard the trumpets, blaring their holy tune.  the Rapture has begun, I immediately got on my knees and started praying to try to join all of those going to heaven, but I was too late, God didn't give me a chance for salvation, nor did he forgive me for my sins. I was condemned to the earth to live out my last seven days without knowing what was to come.

On the first day of the rapture, people were lifted from their homes and were seen getting lifted into the sky by pillars of light, I saw my own parents being lifted, Yet I remained, bound to this forsaken Earth till the end of days.

On the second day, the earth began to crack, shatter, and even erupt. my own home split in half because of these tremors, and I was forced to try and find shelter elsewhere and at this time people were raving about how “God had forsaken us for the end of days was coming” and how “we were all going to die by the greedy hands of Satan” or even worse “be dragged into hell”

On the third day, there were cults of people sacrificing others to “The only god we had left” by throwing them into the cracks in the earth and watching as they were helplessly incinerated in the heat of the molten magma below.

On the fourth day is when everything went from bad to fucking horrible, The sky split open, and began to bleed, for hours the red blood of the gods flooded everything and even changed the ones who dared drink it into horrible chimera like…. Demons… That ravaged buildings and would tear people apart, limb from limb with little to no effort at all. And much like a cut on the skin, the sky scabbed over.

On the fifth day, it was quiet, all the wildlife was oddly silent, that’s when I heard it, the thunderous \*BOOM\* of a foot being planted on the ground, I looked out to see what made the noise and it will forever be burned into my memory for what I saw was a monster that consumed anything it touches, composed of nothing but the screaming flesh of man and animals alike.

On the sixth day, the world was in ruin, absolutely gone with plague, torture, and madness. Not a soul to be saved and all dammed to this torment that we called life. We had no escape, we had no hope, we had no god now. For we have been doomed to the end of days. Then we heard it, the earth split open fully, we saw hell in all of its unholy glory, we saw all who suffered and all who sinned. All I can say is, Dante was right. Hell was leveled

And finally on the seventh day much like a toddler who had nothing better to do god picked at the scabbed over sky and it began to bleed again, raining blood, but this time I had had enough, so I drank from the blood and I could feel my body begin to change, my mind being opened and my perspectives being altered. That’s when I realized From whence the demons came."

A storm is coming, we can hear the winds in the mountains so far away. We must move quick. Ask the laundromat guy if he has a truck to help move the big paintings. There is art all over the walls, every piece is disturbing in its own way. You promise a painting, then immediately regret it, but it is too late. 

There are seeds that if you do something with and then rain falls on you, you will change. You were not there when the original seeds were discovered. No one thinks there are more seeds. You find some seeds and let yourself change. 

Your sisters are missing and the art is still not moved.

As you rush to the art, feathers start falling like snow, you are reminded of angels. You think everything will be ok as the ponds surrounding fill up. 

You realize that there are angels among the feathers. The man from the laundromat is behind this. The angels limbs are removed, they are shaved, and blinded. They are chained. Everyone who sees loses hope. They cry as they lift the angels from the feathers.  

You remember the seeds and that you have changed. You ask an angel to heal and he does. 

For some reason the laundromat has moved, but you know where it is. The inside is different, it is no longer dark. And it is deeper and taller than before. There is a tunnel at the bottom that leads to darkness. You must not go near this tunnel. Your sisters are here, they are being brought to the tunnel. you quickly drag them out. You pull hard from whatever is holding them. You promise the demon to come back. He looks younger now. He wants something. 

Your art is now ready to go. 

You come back. He tries to tempt you. You are tempted. He wishes you to fall and become bound to him like others before. He does not know you have changed. It is a dance as you figure out how to defeat him. You are tempted. 

The storm is coming closer, a man is checking that everyone is gone, he checks the laundromat. he sees you and begs you to leave before the storms arrival. The man is not safe in the laundromat. You trick him into leaving, you slam the door shut. He bangs on the door before leaving. The dance continues. You are tempted. Before it can be completed, 

You wake up."

Well let me tell you, most accidents happen at home but most hauntings happen at work! About 80%.

Here is my story of how I was haunted at work:  

My boss is Mr. Johnson and he would never show his face. That's already weird, but I thought ""whateve r"" and just kept working there, doing my nine to five and filling in forms because it was a desk job.  

Here is where the scary, creepy stuff starts, though. I saw my boss! And nobody else in the office where I work at ever had. SO I looked through the window into his office and he was sitting there looking at his computer but his face looked all wrong, there were eyes where his mouth should be and there was blood dripping from holes where his eyes should be. It looked hyper-realistic.

I quit the company where I used to work at that day and haven't gone back since. I'm very traumatized."

Eric thought about this, but he didn’t know anymore. The word love had lost all meaning, become part of the nightmare that was now his daily life.

Today was the same as every other day. He was trapped in darkness, and entirely alone. Yet, the moment he heard something, his body tensed up. It tensed up because he heard... her.

He knew what was coming long before she entered. It was always the same, always the same every single goddamn day. Eric knew he couldn’t handle it anymore, he just couldn’t, yet he had to.

There was no other way.

When the door opened, he clenched his eyes shut with all the force he could muster.

“Do you love me?” her guttural, hard voice echoed from outside and for a moment it filled the entire small room.

“O-Of course I do,” he answered in a trembling voice.

There was a giggle, a giggle that could’ve come from the throat of a little girl, if it hadn’t been so deep, so grating. Yet, it lasts only for a mere moment.

The voice turned hard again, hard and cold.

“Then why aren’t you looking at me?” it demands. No, almost shrieks at him.

And so, trembling in fear, Eric finally opens his eyes.

In the dim light that entered the room, he could finally make out his disgusting, putrid prison cell. He could see his own excrements, his blood, and what remained of his fellow captives.

But the worst, by far, was her.

The thick, bloated monstrosity of her body. She was a disgusting, humongous thing, her body more that of a worm than a human. Rolls and rolls of fat slithered inside, pushed through the door before she came to a rest in front of him.

Her fat sausage fingers reached out to hold his face in her hands. For a second her tiny, button eyes rested on his before she let him go again.

She was a creature of purest disgust. Her smell was so unbearable it made Eric’s eyes water. When she brought her mouth close to his, he instinctively cringed back, his body trying to flee, but the chains made any escape impossible.

Her lips came to rest on his and when her disgusting, bloated tongue pushed into his mouth, he almost gagged.

Instantly, her face grew hard again. Her body started shaking in anger.

“What’s the matter?” the inhuman amalgamation of fat demanded of him.

“N-No, it’s nothing. You’re beautiful,” he finally pressed out, contorting his face into the semblance of a smile.

The creature giggled again before she turned from him and slithered back towards the door.

As it fell shut, he was at last able to relax. For he knew, he’d live yet another day."

She was there when I reached the gates, and Cerberus sung his song. Between the panes I saw her ghostly face, grinning ear to ear. My eyes melted of hot blood. As I called for Gabriel, he laughed back at me. 

My soul left on that day. A dark angel sent to retrieve. Dress pulsing dark black through the wind. ""Who are you?"" I asked. ""Persephone,"" she said. ""Come my child, for Charon seeks you.""

Years ago, my dad disappeared. That was a long time ago. But I've always missed him. My life... it was meaningless without him. But I kept living for my mom. Again that happened years ago. But still...

kdmct6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kdmct6/making_memories/,Making memories,106,9,1608041323.0,"In the late 2010s we developed the first successful “mind reading machines”. Machines that could accurately interpret brain patterns and give it back as readable information. In the late 2020s we were able to create non-invasive brain to brain interfaces. In 2036 the first commercial non-invasive memory extractor was created enabling people to accurately extract memories, together with their associated feeling, senses and inner monologues directly from their brain and saving them on hard drives.

The technology was intended to be the ultimate version of the photo album and the scrap book, allowing people to revisit and re-experience fond memories and share them with loved ones.

People used the tech differently. Nowadays the internet is full with easily downloadable memories from across the word. Ads on news feeds are flooded with “cutest baby memories”, inboxes with “hottest XXX memories. CLICK NOW!”, forums with “amazing FTW sports memories” and “DIY: how to master literally any human skill- collections of human memories” among countless other memories.

Now while this new age of shared experience brought a lot of good, bringing the world closer together and helping societies bridge cultural differences, there were some danger to memory sharing.

The most obvious danger, the one hundreds of PSAs warned against, was memory addiction. When you overloaded yourself with too many memories you could completely lose your sense of self. You couldn’t really differentiate between your own experiences and those of others. This was especially dangerous for young kids, whose character hadn’t fully developed yet. Honestly fuck those parents that just leave their kids alone with a tablet and a memory headset to keep them quiet. Disgusting.

Now the more hidden and less talked about dangers involve… well humanities morbid curiosity. Remember the olden days of the internet full of gore threads where young adults could prove their bravery by claiming to be unfaced by the sight of human entrails spilled on the freeway? Yeah that is still a thing, but now with authentic memories of horrific injuries and accidents that you could download directly into your brain. Enjoy the full experience and shock of that one guy who got his leg cut of in a motorcycle accident or the terror of the woman whose slip line cord broke and crashed into the tree. Fun!

That stuff isn’t for me. It’s not that I can’t handle a bit of blood, but I don’t particularly enjoy the feeling of suffering or having the memory of it. I have a different niche interest.

Not to brag, but I have to say I’m a bit of a celebrity in the darker corners of the memory sharing world. See, experiencing gore for themselves isn’t enough for some people. They like me don’t particularly enjoy suffering themselves, but they do like to experience the suffering of others.

I grab my newest purchase: a live feed memory share cap. Sledgehammer in hand I peer through the Johnsons window. All there, good. My fans are waiting.

Time to make some happy memories."

It was a simple task of picking up the washing powder, milk and eggs before the missus gets back. If he doesn’t get the washing powder, then he’s a dead man. Tanya said it herself. 

The milk and eggs were just for a spot of lunch… 

Trevor was a meticulous man, rarely prone to human error. He turned all of the plugs off, turned the cooker’s ignition off, turned the electrical items off. He often took photos of the front door just to allay his anxieties and tell himself that it was locked. But this time; the window was ajar.

Trevor closed the door behind him, put the keys in, twisted it shut and shook the handle to ensure that yes, it was shut. He left the front door open once before – all day long… eight hours with the front door open. He got lucky. Perish the thought to do that again. 

But… Trevor saw the crack of the window. He’s just popping to the shops. He’ll be back in a jiffy. Does he need to open the door again, go into the bedroom and close the window. 

*Just leave it open.* He told himself. 

He’s going to be gone fifteen minutes. MAX… Who could possibly do anything in that time? 

He wasn’t gone fifteen minutes. The queue at the market was forty-five minutes. It was a Wednesday afternoon and the pensioners came out in full swing. 

He was anxious as he stood in the queue. He knew that the window was open (not even open, it was ajar), but it played with his anxiety. Every second in that queue was a stab to the chest. 

Until it was over. 

Trevor was running across the road and up the stairs of the housing estate and into his flat. The window was still only ajar… All was well. 

Putting the eggs and milk in the fridge, Trevor went to check on the bedroom where the offending window was. There were no signs of any entry. Or anything slipping through that window. 

Trevor made his scrambled eggs; he took it on a plate and planned to go back to bed with his late late mid-afternoon breakfast. 

Trevor was sitting up in bed with his plate when he dropped his mobile phone onto the wooden floor. Reaching down to pick it back up, his hand was covered in ketchup – from the scrambled egg, of course!

*Did I drop some eggs on the floor?* 

Trevor placed the plate on the bedside table beside him. He put his head down to peer under the bed. There was a LOT of ketchup. More than what was on his plate. He reached under the bed to see where the spillage was. He felt something soft, furry and lifeless – it was **Cuddles –** it was his cat, drenched in ketchup. 

He peered further under the bed and he…

kdl3vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kdl3vr/whisper_world/,Whisper World,7,1,1608036428.0,"It was my friend Horace who showed me the place by whispering in my ear.

Everything in this other world seems muted. Colors, voices forced into nothing more than simmering whispers, a sort of cadence that hums along unobtrusively. I'm increasingly convinced these hushed tones are sustaining this dimension.

Bodies are drained of fleshy weight, replaced by a papery existence that you'd think would mean you couldn't be killed in violent ways.

But you'd be wrong.

Horace invited me to his house after I had transported there, and I found myself a mere mindless servant to his wishes. 

Horace would always tell me he was a peasant in the world you and I live in, but a king in this landscape formed of subdued colors and lethargic inhabitants. I suppose once I found myself moving along a road of faded asphalt, I couldn't really argue with his assertions.  

When I arrived at Horace's house, I glimpsed other gossamer thin people sitting around on furniture that seemed hollow and ill-suited to support even them.

Horace smiled, a demented, uneven curvature of the lips.

""I invited you to this little party for a reason,"" he uttered in a whisper. 

With a brush of two of his flat fingers, the guests arose obediently, the fear apparent in their near colorless eyes.

As if placed inside an invisible shredder, the guests were torn apart violently, blood lashing out like punishing waves of brilliant color in a world otherwise devoid of it. 

In that bleak, terrible moment I screamed. 

The world began to crack at the seams, and I screamed again. This time, out of a sense of determination rather than fear.

The cracks became more pronounced until eventually the tapestry of muted geometry shattered completely. 

I found myself back in my world, sitting on my bed. Staring at hands filled with flesh.

Except Horace stood there, looking like an odd cardboard cutout which had been granted human substantiality. 

He still had that uneven, evil grin on his face. 

""Did you like your first visit to my world?"" Horace asked. ""Because there is plenty more where that came from.""

Now every day I take a trip to the whisper world, and the most horrifying experiences I've had involve me doing something other than whispering.

Then that horrible world shatters, and I find myself back in my own."

I steal blood.

I know what you’re thinking. 

You’re picturing a guy breaking into a blood bank. 

“Stick ‘em up! Gimme all that sweet, sweet O Negative!”

But that’s not what I mean when I say that I like to steal blood. I’m much sneakier about it. 

See, I’m a phlebotomist. For those who don’t know, that means I go around the hospital poking people with needles, digging in their arms for veins while they squirm. 

I’ll walk in at 4:30 in the morning usually, turning on the lights without a care, and will cheerfully say, “Good morning! The doctor wants us to take some of your blood. I hope you aren’t allergic to mosquitoes! BZZZZZZZZZZ!” 

Or some other such nonsense. If they’re too scared it’s hard to find a vein, so it’s a real balancing act. Because I need them to be afraid. 

The ritual described in the book is very specific about that. 

I also have to chant, so I do that softly under my breath. Occasionally I get weird looks from people with excellent hearing. But half the old folks need hearing aids and they don’t even bother putting them in for me. The bloodsucker. 

Often I’ll be told to take just one vial. The stuff is so precious after all, wouldn’t want any of it to go to waste! 

Just one test tube of that red viscous liquid is all they ask for. But the patient doesn’t know that. 

So I’ll take two or three! Sometimes four, five, or six vials of the stuff. People don’t know the difference. They don’t even miss it. Usually. 

What do I do with it, you ask? 

Well, that’s the fun part!

I take it home with me. And into my bathtub it goes. 

See, the book says you need a certain quantity of blood to summon it. And I’ve almost got enough. 

It took a bunch of research to figure out what all those medieval measurements translated to. 

“Gather a basin of blood from an assortment of terrified victims,” I managed to figure out using some translation websites. But it took a while to figure out that a “klafter” is six feet and “Elle” is the distance from elbow to fingertip. Pretty much exactly the dimensions of my bathtub, give or take. 

So I filled it up with blood, and started singing. 

The song was easy enough to remember. Just five words repeated over and over. 

I started to get sleepy by the end of it, as if being lulled to sleep. 

The pain I felt was extraordinary when my forehead hit the tile floor in the bathroom, and I passed out a few seconds later. 

Right after I saw the blood begin to overflow the tub. 

It poured over the side and inched towards me where I lay. 

The crimson liquid mixed with mine and the world went dark. 

I’ve been losing track of time since then. 

Today it was an hour and a half. Tomorrow, who knows?"

When I was 16 I got into a fight with a guy called Larry and he was a man in his late 20s. I guess at the time he had every right to shout at me and my friends, as we were causing a nuisance outside his house. I also had a gun on me and it was my fathers and I wanted to show it off to my friends. 

When Larry was shouting at me I just shot him dead because I needed to act tough to my friends, but when he came back to life he simply said to me ""you have to be at least 18 years old to kill me and you need identification as well"" 

I tried shooting him again in the head but when he came back to life again he simply told me ""you need to be at least 18 years old to kill me and before you kill me you need to show identification"" and my friends and I were in utter disbelief. We never heard of anything that requires an age rating to kill someone. Age ratings are usually for films, books and foods. 

Then when I was 17 I went to Larry's house and I had a fake .I.D. which said I was 18. I knocked on Larry's house and showed him my fake .I.D. when he opened the doors. I then shot him in the head when he opened the doors. For a couple of weeks I watched his dead body, and then Larry came to life, and in a croaky like zombie voice he said to me ""you are not 18 you have to be at least 18 to kill me. You had a fake .I.D."" 

He was a zombie now because he was dead for quite a while and tried to bite my friend, and so I locked him in his cellar. My friends and I took turns keeping a look out for nearly a year. Then one day Larry managed to break through the old wooden cellar door and started eating one of my friends who was taking his turn on a look out. 

""Good thing there's no age rating to kill him"" Larry told me while he was eating my friend. We all managed to put him back inside the cellar while also chaining Larry up now.

Good thing I am closest to turning 18 out of all of my friends, and I will be bringing my passport as proper proof of my age so I can finally kill Larry. "

Being a college freshman, I thought it would be funny to start keying cars around my campus parking lot for kicks. It was fun for about 5 minutes, the novelty (and idiocy) of it, Chadwick and Ames squealing at my daring behavior.

Then a grey minivan pulling into the lot jumped the curb. I suddenly saw my rapidly growing reflection in its tinted windshield, the burning smell of exhaust, my stomach turning cold.

Everything stopped. The bumper was millimeters from my shins. A pigeon was frozen on a stop sign, eyes glazed. Chadwick’s mouth was opened mid yell. I was glued in time, about to become a red stain on the asphalt. 

A quiet, ugly voice echoed in my right ear. It didn’t sound angelic. Rather, it sounded irritated, like I had farted loudly in its direction.

“This young? You sure? Awful stupid of you. Anyway, just say the word, boss.”

I don’t know if the voice was directed at me or at some higher power, but I screamed mentally with all my might, “I want to live!”

The voice sighed, exasperated, and spoke again.

“You’re stupid, so I’m gonna help you out.”

And then I was standing on the sidewalk, watching that minivan drive past, spooking the pigeon off the stop sign. I don’t know how I got there, or who put me there. All I know is that I was alive. I started patting my face, my chest, my head, lightheaded with relief. My fingers brushed my forearm and I screamed.

Incredible pain. oozing, warm and sticky. staining my fingers.

I looked at my quivering right arm. There were red letters, not by a pen, but by a blade. The words were carved, deep enough for fresh blood to bubble up and flow as I read the writing.

*Don’t run into traffic.*

I figured that it was the price of salvation, the cost of pulling that brush of death away from my page. I didn’t think too much of it. Wounds heal.

This one didn’t. If anything, it got deeper every day. Eventually, I could see muscle fibers and blood vessels pumping away, torn by the cuts. Constant. unbearable.

5 days later, I tried to go buy a cheeseburger and a milkshake from Auntie Fattie’s. As soon as I touched the yellowed wrapper, my stomach flashed white hot and I immediately threw up all over the table. I ran to the bathroom and pulled my shirt up, gigantic red smears wetting the green fabric.

A young woman jogged by. *Could she have undiagnosed cancer rapidly spreading within her?* 

A small pickup paused to make a left turn. *Could there be a murderer waiting to strike in the backseat?*

Hmm…no. Nothing new to write about with any of those. 

Honestly the real scariest thing she could think of was the reason her and Josh moved in the first place.

It was all over the local news, his teary-eyed parents giving every interview they could, pleading for their son Sam to be returned unharmed. 

The unknown is always the scariest thing for people, Josh had said. And it was true. Who knew when they would find him? When the police would finally make an arrest?

It had felt like that for a few nights, and the sun was careening towards the horizon. I compulsively refreshed pages against the dawn; I was looking for something nocturnal.

I found a post on an American history board by a user who was writing a paper on Colonial superstitions. He had stumbled across a site and wanted to know if anyone could corroborate its claims. The URL was a meaningless string of letters, but the site called itself “Shallow Grave.” There were novel and well-reasoned but insane paranormal hypotheses, such as an inverse correlation between fertility and hauntings, but the lengthiest article was on a forgotten burial practice.

The site claimed that corpses should be buried wide-eyed in shallow graves with their faces above the ground. “The dead who see the sun do not know that they are dead.” It was a fun read. I closed the window and deleted my history. I knew that I would be able to find the link in the forum post again. I knew that I had remembered enough keywords to search for it.

As I squeezed the toothpaste onto the toothbrush, I noticed a speck of filth in the bristles. I didn’t know if I wanted it to be from my mouth or somewhere else. I dreamt of the sunless dead that night. I checked the bristles again before brushing the next morning. When I spat the foam out at the end, it was flecked with filth like vanilla seeds in pastry cream. I was sure that the particles were too big to be dirt. Unlike all other matter, dirt is infinitely divisible and would have dissolved. They were probably just oral fleas. I retrieved a fleck, placed it on my forearm, and waited for it to start sucking my blood.

I couldn’t find Shallow Grave. The forum post had been deleted. The user had closed his account. I asked if anyone else remembered it. Everyone was sure that I was mistaken. I had no more luck with the URL. I didn’t even know how many letters there were. I thought that I remembered an R. The flea must have been crushed to death between the brush and tooth. I needed a shower.

I shampooed my hair and rinsed too much out. I got out and looked in the mirror. My scalp had rubbed raw from the light lathering. Hair clung to bone by follicle roots. I walked leaking to the window by the computer and opened the blinds. There was no sun. I wanted to scream. I needed help. I looked down to the sidewalk.

I was one of the witnesses to his fate, standing on the corner by the municipal library when Isaiah Lassiter came out of the bank, looked both ways and took a long step into the street.

His boot, however, did not find the firmness of asphalt—but sank right into it.

Indeed his whole leg soon disappeared. Then he lost his balance and fell forward, flapping his arms, yelling, before face forward he went and was no more.

I saw a man go overboard a fishing trawler once and it was like that.

Maybe thirty seconds went by and there were his arms, above the surface of the asphalt, waving and splashing like a drowning man's.

The few of us present wanted to help him, but nobody wanted to get too close on account of the weirdness, and Isaiah Lassiter couldn't swim, so he drowned, if that's the right word for it, though why wouldn't it be.

Soon after, the cars parked on the side of the street fell into the asphalt too.

The police came and taped off the street, and for a time the weirdness was confined to Hamilton Street, but eventually people started noticing it in avenues, parking lots and driveways, then it expanded to other streets, until most of the town's asphalt was liquid, and some Toronto newspaper called Neepawa the Venice of the prairies.

Scientists came.

Tourists and adventurers came.

No one could explain it, but someone must have been daring enough to try taking a dip because somehow we found out it was OK to get in and you could go swimming in it, up and down the streets, through the dark, warm liquid so much like denser water.

People splashed, soaked and went boating.

It was a few months after that, at the end of summer, when the killing happened. Some families were in the asphalt in Tupper Avenue near the park when the shark came, looking like asphalt too but having the fin, which cut the road lengthwise before leaping with its black jaws open and swallowing the Peters boy whole.

I can't describe the chaos that followed.

Maybe half the people got out.

The rest died in the asphalt and we never saw them again.

Nobody went into the asphalt after that, except a few divers lowered in a shark cage trying to measure the depth of Hamilton Street, but we never saw them again either.

There are more sharks now, and things with tentacles and sometimes a wind blows making waves only on the asphalt, and it keeps expanding. There's liquid cement and liquid wood, and Mary Cheevers said she saw a grove of liquid trees.

What if tomorrow we wake up as bodies of liquid self, able to swim in one another—

What monsters will find us then?"

Vivid descriptions, colors, models, shapes, every little detail seemed to matter. They wanted nothing left to chance. Christmas, to them, was an endless pile of new toys.

Not her though. She’d sent her list months ago. It only had one item on it. Everyone told her it was impossible, but she believed. Santa could do anything, right? He was magical?

She sat in bed and stared at the letter. She’d made a bunch of them. Passed them around to every fake Santa she could find. At the mall, on street corners, even that strange one that stumbled around Main Street with the stinky breath. 

*To Santa* 

*Love Charlie*

She hoped Santa would know who she was. She didn’t like *Charlene* very much. It felt so old fashioned and boring. Charlie was playful and cheery. But she didn’t feel playful and cheery anymore. But Santa could fix that. Santa could fix everything.

It was well past midnight when she drifted off to sleep. She dreamt of blood and screams and pain; a dream that had been on repeat for months. Yet, there was something different. A tiny fragment of hope. A fleeting sensation of happiness.

She jolted awake in the pitch-blackness. What was that sound? Was it in her dream? It had to be night still. Hours until dawn. But she just couldn’t help herself. It *could* be him. It *could* be Santa.

She carefully made her way down the stairs, all the while worrying that the noise would wake someone up. She almost fell over several times, the full force of her body slamming into the wall as she struggled to regain her balance. But when she finally made her way down, she was alone. Not a soul in sight.

But the cookies were gone. The milk too.

He’d been there! It had to be him! She stumbled excitedly to the kitchen counter, examining the cookie crumbs gleefully. A crippling mixture of anxiety and doubt and anticipation overcame her as she eyed the stocking hanging by the fireplace. It didn’t look empty.

She was shaking like a leaf as she slowly took the stocking down. It was heavy. But the right kind of heavy. A smile stretched from ear to ear as she peered into it.

“Charlie?” her father suddenly stood in the doorway. “What are you doing up?”

“I’m sorry daddy, I just couldn’t help myself,” she lowered her head apologetically, “But look! Look what Santa brought me!”

It took her father a few seconds to register what she was holding in her hands. What she was cradling so lovingly. Then came the scream. A high-pitched hysterical wail.

Charlie didn’t understand. Sure, it smelled really bad, and it had all the wrong colors, and there were maggots, but it *was* hers. No doubt about it. Santa did it. The one thing she wanted, and he delivered.

*To Santa* 

*Love Charlie*

Something. I can't remember what it was for the life of me, but all I knew was it terrified me. Around that time, the body of a man called Percy Davis was found, and sometimes I stay up at night wondering if I witnessed a murder when I was a child, but there isn't any real evidence.Yesterday, I attended my uncle's funeral. I was very close to him, so I was devastated when I found out he died In a car crash. After the funeral, my mom handed me a box.-""Your uncle asked me to give this to you when he passed""-""What's in it?""-""I don't know. He said he only wanted you to see.""I just left the box on the desk in my room. I was too sad to care about it, and I soon fell asleep. Today, I decided to take a look in the box and found two things: a note and a shoe. The note said ""thanks for keeping quiet"". I was confused by this, I didn't know what it meant, so I examined the shoe. At first it didn't seem unusual at all, apart from a stain, but a chill ran down my spine when I saw the engraving on the sole: ""Property of Percy D.""

I now know what I saw when I was little."

xxx

""How was your day?"" Terry asks The Thing under his bed and grabs a comic from his bedside table. Batman. *Ugh*. 

The thing hesitates, pulling back a long tentacle from the ledge of Terry's bed, before speaking. ""Fine,"" it hisses. 

""Aw, c'mon, don't be like that,"" Terry mutters in a mock tone, not particularly interested in the subject. 

The thing remains silent and wraps his tentacles around his exoskeleton. It closes its yes and holds its breath, the smell was becoming unbearable.

A moment passes, and then another. Before long silence cackled throughout the room, filling Terry's head with *terrible* thoughts, and The Thing's head with the hope that perhaps Terry would leave it alone today. The hope didn't last, Terry's thoughts got the better of him.

""Talk to me,"" Terry drawls, even with his soft tone his words held an oddly threatening edge. The Thing hesitates once more, but the silence beginning to close around it doesn't fill it with hope, instead, it suffocates it. So, it speaks. 

""H-how's Elaine?"" It hisses softly, barely audible, but the words reach Terry's ears. A crooked smile forms on his face, and he chuckles. 

""She's fine, just wonderful actually."" He pauses to look at the picture of his girlfriend on his nightstand,  smiling once more before returning to the conversation. ""How are my parents?""

The thing freezes. It opens its wide, black orbs, and shakily turns to meet the two corpses lying opposite him. Its eyes water at the sight of the rotting carcasses, all swelled and covered in grime. The gashes on their bodies now filled with the squirming heads of fat maggots. The smell was so strong it could taste it. It opens its mouth to speak but a gag takes the place of the words on its forked tongue. 

""Tell me,"" Terry whispers. The Thing holds back a sob, turning to look at Terry who'd leaned over the side of his mattress to stare directly into The Thing's watery eyes. ""How are they?""

""F-fine,"" it hisses. ""Just fine."" 

Terry gives another crooked smile, his green eyes bulging from the blood rushing to his head. ""That's good."" He hums, ""Very good."""

&#x200B;

I remember feeling ‘temporary’ whenever someone around me died too early. It’s happened more than a few times. It would, in most cases, lead me to believe that I’ve had an epiphany.

&#x200B;

“*From now on, I’ll prioritize the right things in life,*” I’d think,  “*I’ll stop snorting the validation I get from posting half-baked short stories on Reddit. I’ll turn writing into a career. I won’t go through another mental battle with myself to show up at a job I hate and numb my brain for 10 hours while my teammates small talk about how happy Fridays are. I will call my parents more often, make them feel loved instead of arguing with them about how their views on life are outdated.*”

&#x200B;

But then this ‘epiphany’ would last a couple of hours, maybe a few days at the most. I’d be back to stressing over work deadlines and checking LinkedIn to get jealous of a schoolmate's rapid career progression.

&#x200B;

And then poof, I was the one dying. Turns out, you can overload your brain with stress. A vein burst in my head about a week ago at work, in the middle of a presentation that was being poorly received by upper management. The meeting recording shows that my pupils rolled up inside my head, the white part of my eyes changed color to a deep crimson red, and blood streamed out of them, drenching my shirt even before I hit the ground.

&#x200B;

I want to be really honest here. I’m scared. Doctors said I’ll be gone any minute now. ANY MINUTE. Writing the last line just made it sink in even more. I’m panicking now. I don’t feel at peace or any of that bullshit guys. It’s none of that stuff. Every inch of my body is consumed with total fear at this moment. My family couldn’t make it to see me. My friends couldn’t make it to see me. They’re all far away. I wish I could be better to them and to myself. I wish I wasn’t so overly critical and negative. I’m slightly foggy now. Not sure if it’s the medicine or if I’m dying.

&#x200B;

I wanted to write this not for a bigger purpose, but to finally reflect on life. I’ve managed to keep myself constantly distracted for such a long time, that I don’t think I’ve properly reflected on anything for a while. Funny that writing was the way I finally decided to express my feelings.

&#x200B;

Jamie, if you made it after I died, please share this note online.

&#x200B;

Whoever ends up reading this, I hope it hits you hard. It hits you real hard. Make this your epiphany, please. Let me be of some use in my final moments. Hope your last moments are more peaceful.

&#x200B;

I guess this note is my horcrux. Some part of me will live on every time you read it. I hope someone does. Going now, feeling overwhelmed. Bye"

I got out of bed and looked in disgust as I saw the sweaty graffiti I had left on my sheets, for the past month I’ve been having to put my sheets in the wash everyday from a sweat filled night and honestly it became annoying. I kicked myself and threw my sheets in the wash. I shoved my lighter in my pants ready to start my day until I felt...

*tightness*

Small, so small that I honestly didn’t even realize the sensation in my chest until it went from being a feeling you store in the back of your head to the only thing I felt in my body.

*tightness* 

Dread began to sink in as I felt the weight of my body being 10x times heavier than normal. Lifting up my arms felt like the hardest thing in the world with sweat literally dripping from my fingertips.

*tightness*

I was panting like a dog while gripping to my chest for dear life...

Until everything went....black.

I open my eyes to the most beautiful radiance I’ve ever witnessed. I was hovering over galaxies, going as fast as the speed of light and at the same time as slow as a turtle, pain didn’t exist anymore. Until I felt a pull.

All of the sudden I feel myself being dragged from this euphoria to an ambulance with my body bound to a stretcher.

“Welcome back” said one of the responders.

I darted my eyes to the oxygen tank in the back of the ambulance

I felt the lighter in my pocket that I had stored inside centuries ago.

“I need to go back” I muttered to myself."
kd40ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kd40ft/catheter/,Catheter,210,20,1607972694.0,"I cried when I was intubated. My lungs had started failing, they determined that was Covid positive.


It hurt, obviously, like swallowing a large pipe. I felt the air pump into my chest, and although it was refreshing to fill my lungs all the way, I could hardly move my neck without major strain. 


The nursing aide came in, flashed his badge, and gave me a pitiful look. 


“I have to put your catheter in. This is gonna hurt, and I’m sorry, but I’ll get this over as fast as I can.” He promised me. 


I nodded as much as my neck would allow. The aide was not lying, it felt a hundred times worse than the intubator. That feeling you get after pissing after holding it in for hours? Imagine the exact opposite of that, and SOLID. 


Also, the male urethra is so much longer than you think. It just kept going and going, and I wondered if he even had enough tubes to reach the bladder. Tears rolled down my face as it began to burn. It must have been recently cleaned, the antiseptic felt like it was melting the inside of my groin. 


There was an announcement overhead, something about a security alarm, but I was in too much pain to focus on it. I whimpered, I could yell or speak due to the intubator, and the CNA offered me a pitiful grin. 


“I know, I cringe every time I put one of these in.” He turned to leave.


The pain worsened from a dull ache to a roaring burn. Maybe he hadn’t wiped it down after cleaning it with antiseptic? I hit the call light, hoping the nurse could come do something about it. 


It took her awhile to get to my room, and she looked stressed out. The hospital was full, so that seemed pretty on-brand. 


“Sorry that took so long.” She sat in the chair, looking like she needed a nap. “There’s a security alert, some monster is running into peoples rooms, injecting their IV’s with bleach. What kind of person would…” She turned her attention to my drip, and seeing it untainted, turned her attention to me. “What can I help you with, Josh?”


I pointed to my crotch, rolling my eyes at my embarrassment, and inability to articulate the issue. 


“Oh yeah, sorry, we can put your catheter in soon, we’ve just fallen really behind.” 


I muffled a yell into the intubator, pointing frantically at my groin. 


“Did you have an accident, it’s okay, Josh, I’ve seen wor-” She lifted the blanket. “Oh, they put it in already, good, I-.” She cut herself off, following the catheter down, seeing it was dark red, as if full of blood.


The nurses face turned white as she held up a bottle of bleach, diffusing into my bladder. I had not been urinating, but bleeding. 


The nurse sounded an alarm, the burning pain sparked up worse, and I couldn’t even scream into the intubator. "

She allowed herself a small chuckle, refusing to giggle like the schoolgirl she accidentally resembled. 

Today wasn’t the day for hemming, hawing, or indecisiveness, so the ensemble stayed as she flicked off the news, grateful to interrupt the reporter’s story, which was only making her more nervous about finally returning to the realm of single people. *“So go on and fight me, go on and scare me to death.”* Splendid. 

She grabbed her keys and steeled herself for what she was about to do. Her mind flipped through its ever-ready Rolodex of lyrics, plucking out just the melody she needed to hear: *“And ever since I met you, my life’s been a song. A sad song, a love song, with hate in between,”* though of course the love had long since faded, no matter what he said, with only sadness and hate remaining. She often forgot this. 

She drilled those lyrics into her head, and when they lost all meaning, she switched to something more on-the-nose. *“We… are never, ever, ever… getting back together.”* It wasn’t until she turned the engine off in his driveway that she tasted the blood she’d drawn from her lip. 

His sparkling clean home… No, his overly sanitized, unlivable clinic of a house (she had to keep her resolve, after all) assaulted her senses. Everything was shiny, expensive, new, nauseating. *“You’re a rich little boy, who’s had to work for his toys. You’ve got all the sensibilities of an upper class guy. No, I’m not your little slave. No, I don’t twist and turn that way.”*

“Won’t you please just sit down, darling? Get yourself a drink. Let’s talk about this rationally. You know how you let your emotions control you. The only emotion you need to worry about is my love, which I give you every day, sweetheart.”

*“Poor little rich boy… you don’t love your girlfriend.”* She was stronger today than she’d ever been, but damn she could use that drink. A glass was already waiting on the kitchen counter, filled with her favorite elixir.  She gingerly picked up the glass, but her nerves made it slosh about, so she gulped it down to avoid making a mess.
 
“Enjoy your drink?” She nodded as he smiled too wide. 

*“Your love, your love, your love is my drug.”* She stumbled, confused why her mental jukebox would choose this now. 

As her world shifted beneath her and faded to darkness, she searched for his face and gasped. She never realized just how striking his eyes were: matte, sucking in the light around him, devouring, reflecting nothing back. She, too, consumed.

Her lips pursed in the mirror as she smoothed her side-braid, unsure if she looked more like lamb or mutton in this get-up."

She lay there, rubbing her smooth horns gingerly, lightly pushing up against the naturally smooth surface. A woman opens the door and grabs her. She holds the child gently in her arms and slowly begins to rock back and forth gently.


“Mom, am I really a bad person?”


“No, no, why?”


“They always hurt me.”


“I know they do, they just don’t understand.”


“They don’t understand what?”


“Nobody has a choice as to how they are made. They don’t get to choose their eyes or families, or their hair. So, why should they hurt you?”


“I never wanted my horns.”


“Horns or no horns, I love you the same.”


The child sat at the edge of the side walk on the cul de sac, and smoke wafted heavily from an ashen emaciated frame of torn wood. She sat shivering, and murmuring to herself, squeezing a burnt winter coat. Her horns shimmered under the glow of the neighboring christmas lights.


“I love you too mom. I love you too.”"

Cramped spaces. My claustrophobic self panics to wake up in one. My thoughts are in disarray. This unforeseen situation puts me on edge. ""What should I do? What should I do? I have to get out of this hellish place!"" I think as my hands frantically look for an exit. 

Seconds feel like eternity as I begin my worthless struggle. I'm getting dizzy. I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel like I'm going to die. Drenching with sweat, I tremble as I slowly accept my fate.

It took a second to sink in that I was still a mile and a half from my actual turnoff, and another two to realize that I hadn’t actually been using my GPS.  I sighed and drove up to the overpass light, intending to cross and merge back into the flow of traffic so I could continue on my way.

TURN RIGHT NOW

I was still waiting for the light when the semi began to fishtail.  I watched as it swung right, then left, then tottered up on its left wheels for a long moment before falling to the asphalt with the screech of metal.  When the dust cleared I could see its long body stretched clear across the highway, a chorus of horns coming from the growing number of vehicles below me.  I reconsidered my approach, turned right as the voice suggested, and continued home.

I didn’t think much of it until a few weeks later when I was heading to the mall.  I was preparing to turn into the parking lot when my GPS spoke up again, telling me to continue on.  I did, turning a few blocks later to approach the back entrance.

PERFORM A U-TURN NOW… PERFORM A U-TURN NOW… NOW… NOW… NOW

I only made it a block before the first gunshot rang out behind me.

Since then I have complied with every detour my car has given me, no matter how small.  And in most cases, I have no idea why I was rerouted.  Would I have been carjacked?  Would someone have run across the road in front of me, ending up beneath my wheels or headfirst through my windshield?  My brain has concocted more and more ridiculous, elaborate setups as time has passed.  More than likely most of them have been merely traffic, a feature that is interestingly not tracked by my model’s system.  It doesn’t really matter though.  I’m happy to have someone looking out for me, even if it’s just a disembodied voice issuing from my dashboard.

So this morning, when I started up my car after loading up my groceries and I heard that familiar voice, I was more than ready to do as I was told.  Then I glanced at the screen.

This was new.  It had changed my destination before, but usually it just sent me home, and never so far away.  Curious, I pulled out my phone.  I’ve been sitting here since, frozen, no idea of what to do next.  Those coordinates are in Florida, and there is only one thing there.

He’d been married three times and fathered more than a dozen children. Yet, what love he’d shown at the outset of these relationships soon waned and went away.

He wasn’t an abusive man, no; he was an indifferent man. All he seemed to care for was to sow his seed before he’d return to his family home.

It was an old, secluded mansion deep in the mountains that had been in the Stirling family’s possession for centuries. Out there, James would spend most of his days, far away from civilization.

Only when his grandchildren were born did the old man return. His fierce interest and warm care surprised everyone.

His favorite was his grandson, Thomas.

The boy’s parents were reluctant to let old James back into their life. More than reluctant, for the old man’s obsession with their son, scared them.

Yet, Thomas adored his grandfather. The more his parents tried to cut their bond, the stronger it became.

The old man would teach Thomas many things and eventually afforded him a scholarship to enter a prestigious university.

As the years went by, James Stirling grew ever older and weaker.

One day, when Thomas visited him at his home, he bide the young man to come closer. Without another word, he handed him an old wooden box.

“What’s that grandpa?”

“A present, my dear boy,” the old man said with a weak smile.

“Thank you,” Thomas said and was about to open the box.

The old man stopped him.

“No, please wait, only open it when the day comes, when I’m about to-“

“Nonsense, grandpa! You’ll live another fifty years, I know it!”

James Stirling smiled, but he knew better than anyone.

Four months later he was admitted to a hospital, one, the doctors made clear, he wouldn’t leave again.

When Thomas visited, the old man reminded him of the present.

“I guess, my time has come,” he started. “When you get home today, you might open the box, Thomas. After all, it’s my last present.”

Tears were shed and goodbyes were whispered and the moment Thomas was home, he got a hold of the box.

“Thank you, grandpa,” he whispered as he opened it.

Inside was a gently glowing orb. As he stared at it, the warm light inside bide him to lean in closer. His eyes focused on it, and it almost seemed as if something was inside. Deeper and deeper he looked, was drawn in, and slowly faded away. A moment later, he passed out.

Hours later, the body of James Stirling drew his last breath, and at the same time, Thomas awoke.

With a wide grin on his face, Thomas closed the small box containing the orb.

“Thank you, Thomas,” he cackled.

Once more, the ritual had succeeded, and once more, the ghastly, centuries-old presence that had been James Stirling for the past seventy years would continue on, continue on for yet another lifetime."

Hell, I’m starting to even forget who I am. That being said, I would not wish this life on even the worst of my enemies. I don’t know if this is an experiment or just a fucked up prison. Maybe it’s both.

I’m going to call the room I’m in, the yellow room. There is bright yellow paint on all the walls, and the crusty furniture seems like it was painted with this paint too. In addition, there is harsh artificial sunlight shining in the center of the prison at all hours of the day. We never know what time it is, nor can we sleep very well. I’m lucky to get an hour or two of sleep anymore.

In addition, all the prisoners here are forced to wear bright yellow uniforms and a mask that is either shaped like a sun or moon. We’re never allowed to take it off. There are holes for seeing and eating but that’s it. I don’t even know who the other inmates are. However, we all stare at each other with the same crazed eyes.

A good amount of our day is spent in our cells. When they want us out, a blinding light will be shined into our cells and we’ll be dragged out by a guard wearing a yellow smiley face mask and uniform. They’ll force us to do silly dances or else we’ll be beaten and have a harsh light shined in our eyes while our eyelids are held open. They seem to have fun doing it too. 

One day, one of the guards caught someone getting tired of dancing. They immediately grabbed them and started punching them in the face against a wall. After this, the guards started shining a bright light that lit up the whole room in their eyes. They screamed.

I decided that I had had enough. I nodded my head in the direction of the guards. The other prisoners noticed and nodded as well. If there were enough of us, we could take out the guards and try to escape this damned place.

I ran over and connected my fist with the back of a guard’s head. The other prisoners quickly arrived and delivered a series of blows and kicks as well. It had worked. We took the keys and ran.

However, we didn’t get far down the hallways. I felt my body shut down as a taser connected with me. Only one prisoner was able to get past the onslaught of guards. I pray they got out.

I was forced to look at a blinding light for hours as punishment. Just bright enough to hurt but not bright enough to blind me.

My eyes still feel the pain from that day, and I have spots in my vision. I’m starting to think that there is only one other way to get out of here..."

I looked around. An elderly lady with a bruised eye was extending her arm across the gap between our two balconies.

She smiled. “Young man, I’ve noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time sitting out here looking awfully worried lately. I wanted to make sure you’re eating properly.”

I paused for a moment, giving her a sideways glance. I was new in the building and had only ever seen an old man enter the apartment next door.

I raised my hands in protest. “It’s okay, I’m—”

She leaned over the railing and thrust the plate into my arms. “I insist.”

I rushed inside, planning to toss whatever she’d handed me in the garbage. But then my stomach grumbled. I looked at my watch—almost midnight. I’d just went on a fourteen-hour study binge and hadn’t eaten since breakfast.

I peeled back the foil. She'd given me a mouth-watering beef stew thick with onion and carrots, braised in a red wine sauce. After almost two years of eating nothing but Ramen noodles, it tasted like a little slice of heaven. I licked the plate clean.

The next morning, I knocked on the lady's front door. She opened it as far as the chain would allow. Behind her, I could see two Jack Russell’s fighting over a bone. The landlord had a firm 'no pets' rule, but I wasn’t about the kill the golden goose.

I held up the plate. “That was the single most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted in my *entire* life.”

She laughed. “Well, there’s plenty more where that came from.”

She unhooked the chain and handed me another dish. This one was a beef stir-fry in black bean sauce, garnished with ginger and coriander. It tasted even better than the stew.

Over the next few weeks, she and I got to know one another. Her name was Eleanor, and she lived in apartment 232 with her dogs. Twice a day we’d exchange plates across the balconies. It meant I had one less thing to worry about and could focus on studying for finals. She made all sorts of appetizing dishes: burrito bowls, kidney pudding, cottage pie. Before long, my belt size had shot up three notches.

One afternoon, there was a knock at the door. It was the Police. They wanted to know if I’d seen or heard from the man who lived in apartment 232. I told them the only person living there was Eleanor.

They said they were looking for Eleanor’s husband. He’d disappeared, and Eleanor was refusing to help with their investigation.

I shrugged. ""Haven't seen him. Sorry.""

I went out to the balcony. Eleanor was waiting for me. To celebrate the end of finals, she’d prepared one last extra-special dish. It was beef Wellington stuffed with spinach and chestnut mushrooms, coated in a flaky, golden pastry.

I wiped the drool off my chin. “Eleanor, you’ve outdone yourself.”"
kcvi2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kcvi2j/phantom_pain/,Phantom Pain,273,5,1607943225.0,"I lost my left foot in a motorcycle accident when I was only 23. Losing a limb at such a young age would be reason enough for most to fall into depression, but in addition to my new cripple status I had to suffer from horrible phantom pain in this foot, that was no longer there. 

Every day I awoke with a burning and stabbing sensation around the stump of my leg, where my foot used to be. I took meds that throughout the day numbed the pain and all feeling in general, but every morning brought the same pain.

Some days I didn’t take the pain medication. Those days were special occasions. Days that were special to us; special to her. I regarded those days as days of remembrance and days of penance. There was much more, than just a limb, I lost that day of careless driving.

On some days of penance I visited her grave. Some days I visited father McNeil afterwards for confession. Those days were often followed by good days, good weeks even. The pain was almost gone then and I didn’t even have to take my meds. It always returned eventually. Always when I started forgetting the pain. Always when I started forgetting her…

Two weeks ago, I had another accident. A woodworking accident this time. It wasn’t really my fault that it happened, but my thumb had to be amputated. Immediately after the operation I felt a burning pain were my thumb used to be. 

I asked the doc about it. I asked if that was normal. He basically just told me that they don’t really know how that happens and that only some people with amputations even had phantom pains. I was just unlucky…

Yesterday was her birthday. I was at confession again. I immediately felt better and both limbs were quiet. Afterwards, pain-free and feeling lighthearted, I spoke with father McNeil and joked about my limbs. I told him that maybe I would only get one wing in the afterlife or that maybe I had to collect all my lost pieces before I could enter through the gates. He smiled somberly and replied that maybe my limbs were already waiting for me in the afterlife. 

I couldn’t sleep that night.

I called in sick today at work. I stayed home. I googled. 

""phantom pains""

„phantom pain why?“

""Phantom pain afterlife“

„phantom pain sin“

I found something. It’s called phantom eye syndrome. Phantom pain and visual hallucinations after eye removal. Hallucinations…

I have to see for myself. See if I’m right. I’m sorry Clair!

I rammed the screwdriver deep into my eye, making sure that I took most of it out before the pain knocked me unconscious.

I awoke with searing pain in my eye and I saw the flames. I saw them eating a foot and I saw them eating a thumb. I saw them waiting for the rest."

Welcome to Franklin Elementary School. We are so glad you joined our faculty as our new elementary teacher. Our school is a little different than others, but follow these rules, and your time here with the kiddos will be wonderful! 

1. Kids will be kids, so they will inevitably get hurt. If it’s something you can handle, take care of it yourself. There is a first aid kit in each one of the rooms. As thankful as we are for our school nurse, some of her experiments can get out of hand. 

2. If a child acts up or performs poorly on an assignment, do not send them to see me. Send them to the cafeteria, and the lunch ladies will be sure to take care of them. We can’t have anyone ruining our school’s perfect scores!

3. As a elementary teacher, your day is dedicated taking care of and teaching the children. Unfortunately, there are no breaks. Any staff member who says otherwise is lying. Do not go with anyone into the break room. 

4. You will have 20 students in your class. Make sure no more return to your class after recess. If one slips by you, leave your class and come to my office immediately. You won’t be able to save all 20 children. 

5. Do now allow the children to play on the monkey bars any time after 2pm. They are always occupied.

6. Sometimes you will enter your classroom and see only one child seated in the far back corner. This will only happen rarely. When it does, remain calm and go about teaching as if you were teaching an entire class such as putting assignments on each desk, asking questions, etc. Do not acknowledge this student. However, she will say and do anything to get your attention. 

7. Only interact with teachers of your same grade level. Other faculty have been given different sets of rules, and you never know what they may do to you to keep themselves safe.

8. Our school is proud to be founded on the blood and sweat of our staff and faculty! Do not look for other places of employment unless you want to be part of that legacy as well. 

9. Once every quarter you will have a staff evaluation meeting with me. If you walk into my office and I am writing with my left hand, I am gone. Promptly explain you need to go back to the classroom, and leave. It is imperative that you don’t let him catch you before you make it back to your room. He’ll be watching you from outside, but you’ll be safe as long as you don’t move. 

We have our full confidence in you that you will be an effective educator. Study these rules as much as you would study your lesson plan. Good luck!"

I've no idea how old the house actually is, at least fifty years I would guess. It's a fairly normal suburban house, two storey's and a basement. There were a few boxes probably full of junk and some old furniture in the basement, I could see as I scanned my Maglite through the darkness. I walked down the few steps into the basement properly, and knocked my head against the bare lightbulb, dusty and bewebbed. I pulled the cord and the light dimly illuminated the space. Beyond the stacked boxes I could make out the entrance to what I presumed was a sub-basement, where the light couldn't quite reach. I made my way across the room, and squeezed past the boxes, turning my Maglite back on to illuminate the steps that descended into the sub-basement. I made my way down the first few, realising then that the stairs went much deeper than I had assumed. I shone my lite ahead of me, nothing but stairs descending further and further down.

Glancing backwards, I shine the Maglite up the stairs behind me, the ascending steps I've walked down, but I can no longer see the light of the basement. I've been walking down these steps for hours now and the batteries in my torch are beginning to die. Darkness beyond, and yet more steps?"

He was taken to hospital in a critical condition so his delivery for the week was never cancelled and came as scheduled.

I have this occuring problem and I don't know how to get it stopped. No matter which house or flat I live in, the floors will always start to turn bumpy. The only way to flatten the floors is by getting a live person to roll over the bumpy floors, to flatten the floors again. I don't know how this happens or why?

A year ago I was in this other flat and the floors eventually started to go bumpy. I had to roll on the floor myself to flatten the flooring. Then it started to bump again and me rolling on the ground wasn't working and so I got a homeless man to come into my flat and I started to force him to roll on the ground. 

I must have broken many of his bones and dislocated many of his joints but the floors were flat. Then I moved into a house and the floors eventually turned bumpy again and I found out that the younger the person that rolls on the bumpy floors, the easier it is to flatten the floors. Their were a few youngsters in Gangs in that area and so when the floors were bumpy again, I kept my doors open for one of those rascals to come inside. 

Then one day those rascals did enter my house and  I grabbed one of them, and started rolling him on the ground to flatten the floors again. I could hear his bones breaking and blood was coming out, I nearly killed the kid. Floors were flat again though. 

Then I recently moved to another place and it was another house on rent. The concrete floors turned bumpy. I then heard a baby crying outside next to the bins that had been abandoned by its parents. I grabbed the baby and was amazed how easily the floors were able to be flattened when I rolled the baby on the floor. The baby is young and I didn't need to put that much pressure on the baby because it's so young. I might just keep it to flatten more floors."

I can trace my ancestors all the way back to the late middle-ages, which is almost unheard of for a family not of the nobility. 


An illustrious lineage of expedient executioners. I would've been the thirteenth. If anyone would hire me. But you don't want to hear of my woes.


How about a history lesson, instead?


In the seventeenth century, my forebear traveled the length and breadth of Britain, a hangman for hire. Such work was lucrative, but somewhat sporadic, even in times of witchtrials, and piracy on the high seas. 


A hangman's pay was supplemented by being allowed to tax prostitutes and lepers. However, even in those draconian  days, hangmen were shunned by others. Their honest work, though very necessary, was viewed as ""blood money,"" their skilled hands tainted. 


The masses' mindset was maintained throughout the ages. My grandfather, whose skills were legendary, parlayed his pay into the opening of a pub. But locals never accepted him as a friend, many spitting in his face and cursing his name. 


My grandfather served the authorities throughout World War 2, finishing several notorious nazi figures after Nuremberg. Just a quick glance at these wretches was enough to judge the length of rope required to end their time. 


But despite his years of loyal service, my grandfather received scant recognition or reward. 


Kings and Prime Ministers see our kind as beneath them. Always have.


After the war he hanged murderers and unfortunates found guilty by an inflexible British justice system. And he taught his trade to my father, who in turn taught me.


I inherited the tools of the trade; a thick brown noose, darkened through years of use. Countless necks enveloped in such a snug loop. Somewhere coarse against the skin, but I guess that's the least of people's worries when they stand above the trapdoor.


The leather straps which fastened around wrists, waists and ankles were made to last. The eyes of them are stretched through struggle. A black velvet hood; is that merciful, or perverse?


My dad hid his bitter disappointment when he showed me the ropes. Taught me in a pragmatic way, dispassionate to the last. 


I was just happy to be getting any sort of attention. 


Britain doesn't hang people anymore, but I remember him saying ""you never know. They might bring it back, lass."" It's the one time I saw him smile. Then he had me run through my measurements again, based on height and weight. A clean snap, no pain. No more suffering. 


No more anything. Just an end. And that can be a relief. Witnesses might sigh deeply. And carry on with their lives. They might even be happy, though that is surely incidental.


I've bequeathed my tools to a museum. After they've been used this final time. No-one will hire a hangwoman. I've enquired worldwide. Tradition will be the death of me."

One afternoon when Alice woke up, she took a moment to realize why it was the office table and not her home sofa she was sleeping on. It all came back with a sudden jolt: there had been a robbery at their bank this morning. As Alice turned her head rather painfully, she realized that some other victims (some of whom were tied to the chair) were slowly waking up too.

Alice recalled that she had given a good fight to the scoundrels, she was definitely one of the last to have given up the struggle. The bank's management will surely be pleased and rewarding her once the footage of this incident comes out. But Alice had only begun to think about the happy thoughts of how she will be spending the reward with her family when the sound of a door creek nearby jolted her back to reality.

Alice slowly got off the table and cowered behind it in case a robber had decided to come back. But she heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of the lady cop approaching in her direction. Alice immediately rushed towards her as the lady in uniform gave her a grim and dismal look.

But Alice realized that something was wrong, was the cop really looking at her? Alice nervously glanced behind to see if the cop was looking at someone else but even before she had turned her head, her eyes fell upon a figure which left her frozen with terror in an instant. It was Alice herself, dead with two bullet holes in her chest, blood spilling all over the floor.

The memory came back rushing like a storm now. She had managed to give such a vigorous fight to the robbers that they had shot her immediately. Closing her eyes with utmost sadness in them and dreading about what will come next, Alice started preparing for the next journey."

Every Sunday afternoon, they would stroll through the field, taking in the sunshine and each other’s company. 

They laid down in the tall grass and John hit his head on something hard. He turned around to see a beautiful horseshoe with barely a smudge of dirt on it. He picked it up, marveling at the lustrous metal. “Look at this,” he handed the horseshoe to Feu. 

“Oh, wow. Magnifique!” She said in awe. “It’s so shiny!”

“Maybe I should keep it. You know, lucky horseshoes and all that.”

“Yeah! Maybe we’ll be blessed with your long lost uncle’s countless riches!” They both laughed. 

John held the horseshoe all the way home, wondering how it kept its perfect shine. When they made it home, he hammered it into the wall above their fireplace. It caught the light perfectly, sending shimmers across the living room. The way it arced downwards gave it the feel of a silver rainbow. 

“Oh, parfait!” Feu gasped as it flashed a beautiful arc of light onto the wall. 

They sat in the living room, cuddling in the cozy warmth of the fire, watched over by their new good luck charm. Soon, they both fell asleep. 



John woke to thick smoke and blazing heat. As he opened his eyes, he saw an inferno crawling towards him across the carpet. Quickly, he shook Feu awake.

The fire crept closer, burning from the fireplace outward. John silently cursed himself. He must have left something flammable close to the fire.

Every exit was cut off. Their couch was isolated by a wall of flickering, burning snakes. Frantically, John searched for something, anything, to save them. Feu sat still, her mind and body in a state of panic.

The fire grew higher with every second, eating away at the minuscule shred of hope they shared. John held his love close, fear quickly replacing his desperation. 

The burning fingers grasped at the couch, inching ever closer. The heat was unbearable. 

Finally, after an eternity-long minute, the roof collapsed onto the two poor souls, intertwined in life and death. 

The flames calmed, their work complete. The house was decimated, except for a single wall.

Block your sight and then turn a half spin,

When you open your eyes,

You may be surprised,

With the graves of unlucky children.

&#x200B;

These graves will be granite, or marble or slate,

With the names of deceased smeared with grime,

If you wipe them off good,

As I hope that you would,

Their ends are all given in rhyme.

&#x200B;

“Poor Sally Joyce was missing her voice,

This one flaw could not even be seen,

While she flailed in the lake,

Her head sunk in to a wake,

But no one could hear her small scream.”

&#x200B;

“Rich Timmy Kord had a magical sword,

That he used to poke his friends for fun,

When the robber broke in,

Timmy tried to defend,

But his twig was no match for a gun.”

&#x200B;

“Young Philip Gold, so brave and so bold,

Too proud, he thought he was pure brawn,

With the danger he faced,

He laughed and he braced,

But the semi still hit him dead on.”

&#x200B;

“Kind Millie Jed had a magical head,

With ideas quite smart and profound,

Swinging with her friend Pete,

She fell off her seat,

And smashed all those thoughts on the ground.”

&#x200B;

“Short Johnny Sun, still a baby at 1,

(If he lived, he would have gone far),

Sweating in a bad state,

He tried to escape,

The oven that was his mom’s car.”

&#x200B;

“Tall Larry Zimb was a little bit dim,

And his name brought along many sighs,

On a 3 story roof,

That ill fated goof,

Was sure he could learn how to fly.”

&#x200B;

You may think, “this is crazy, no way this is true,

No bodies are interred in this lawn!”

And you’re probably right,

Because try as you might,

As soon as you blink, poof, it’s gone.

&#x200B;

So run along home, straight back into town,

and I know you will groan, cry and sweat,

At their twisted fates,

But don’t worry, just wait,

There’s no gravestone for you,

Well, not yet."

It must be the cat, she's always been active, even at late hours. I can't see in the total darkness, but slowly, my eyes start getting adjusted. I look around, and the desk, the closet, the shelf, the bedside table, everything starts to take form. Then, I see the bedroom door slowly, and slightly creak open. And long, black fingers reach in through the gap. I blink, since I think I hallucinated, and when I reopen my eyes, the fingers are gone. I hear some hardly audible scratches on the wooden floor. I gulp, and pull the blanket up a little more. Then, I decided to turn my lamp on, for safety. And I do. But... It doesn't help. It's here. It is leaning above me, a skinny, bone-like, tall figure. And It reaches to my chest. I'm shaking. And screaming. It digs It's fingers deep into my chest. I cough up blood, as I feel my chest area being pulled apart. My intestines depart. The last thing I see is It, feasting from the ruins of my body. 

I open my eyes, screaming in agony. The bright lights blind me for a second, before I get adjusted to the completely white room. My arms and legs are tied to the bed, and I can't move. My chest hurts from my heart beating so fast because of the nightmare. Then, a lab assistant walks in, in a white lab coat. She smiles at me. And the smile is anything but sincere. It's rather demonic

And now, they're doing it again. This chemical makes me fall asleep, and have the same nightmare over and over again. But I can't do anything,let alone change the dream. I'm simply unable. 
They need the energy my brain produces from this nightmare. My greatest fear.

“John, is that a pun?” He groaned, wrapping his arm around me. “But yeah, this is the most perfect view I’ve ever had.”


We stared at the Earth. My husband and I were stationed on the moon, to collect samples and investigate some odd frequencies coming from the surface. It took a lot of convincing, but control let Brad and I team up for the mission. We were excited, we had met while training as astronauts, and despite the southern attitude surrounding us, we were an accepted, equal couple among our colleges. 


“Down there, it matters to some people that we’re together.” Brad mused.


He was right. Up here on the moon it was silent. We were the only two living things, there was no judgement, no stress, no fear. Our only concern was the mission. 


Brad had me a little worried lately. He hardly slept and seemed more stressed than usual. I was trying to catch a nap while he tuned into the frequency. I heard him mumble for me a few times, but pretended to be asleep. Despite the fun of the mission, I was exhausted. 


A few hours later, we were back outside, collecting more samples of moon rocks. I don’t see what makes them so fascinating, they’re just regolith after all, but the lab loves analyzing them. 


“What?” I asked Brad for the third time. He kept whispering under his breath, and it was starting to get to me. 


“Not talking to you.” Brad said, looking worried. 


I tried to shrug it off; mission first, relationship second, that had been the deal. But I kept hearing him talk through the radio, and finally I snapped. 


“Dude what are you saying? Just talk to me instead of mumbling!” I yelled, harsher than I meant to. 


Brad turned to me, I saw him grinning through his helmet. “She was telling me how to stay here with you for the rest of our lives.” 


“Hang on; she?” I asked, starting to get concerned. 


Brad put his hand on the lunar surface, rubbing it like an animal. “The girl we came to investigate. I had to translate the signal, but when I did, she made it all clear. We can stay here, forever, away from judgemental pricks, weird glares at dinner, the stress of life on Earth.” 


Full panic. “Brad, there’s no girl. Let’s get you back to the ship, you need to sleep.” I hoped that would be enough to settle him, or it’d be a long trip home. 


He gave me a scared look. “No, don’t get on the ship.” 


“What do you mean? We have t-”


Electricity emitted from the ship as it burst. Pieces of it scattered, floating across the surface. Brad held up wires from the engine. 


“I asked her, and she told me if the ship was gone, you and I could stay here with her. Forever.”

kceyq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kceyq3/twenty_questions/,Twenty Questions,3526,74,1607881668.0," 

Do you remember the game 20Q? 

20Q was the computerized version of the parlor game Twenty Questions. You would think of an answer, like “shovel”, and the game would ask you 20 yes-or-no questions. At the end of the round, the console would guess your answer based on the responses you provided.

I had all but forgotten about the game until I agreed to help my mother with spring cleaning. I was clearing out my brother’s room while she was tilling our backyard for planting. I knew I’d have to go take over for her soon or she would insist that she could finish all the heavy digging herself.

I was packing up the last box when I saw our old 20Q console. Years go, Adam and I had begged our mother to buy us one. Looking at the plastic crimson sphere now brought back a flood of memories. Feeling nostalgic, I thought of an answer and powered the game on.

The console emitted a sequence of beeps before asking, *Is it…an Animal?*

*No*, I answered.

*...Vegetable? No.*

*...Mineral? No.*

*...Other? Yes.* 

The box beeped. *I’m thinking…* 

*Is it a living thing? No.* 

*Is it a tool? No.* 

*I’m thinking…* 

*Can you play with it? Yes.* 

*Can you play pirates with it?* 

I frowned. That was oddly specific. Still, I answered, *Yes.* 

*If while playing pirates you pushed it a little too hard and it fell down the stairs and broke, would you…  Try to fix it? No.* 

*Call your mother? No.* 

*Panic and try to cover up your mistake?* 

My hands shook a little as I pressed *Yes.*

*When your mother asked you where it was, did you… tell her the truth? No.* 

*Lie and say you hadn’t seen it? Yes.* 

*When you tried to hide your mistake, where did you stash it? Did you… store it in your closet hoping no one would notice? No.* 

*Drag it out to the dumpster in a trash bag? No.* 

*…Bury it in the backyard?* With trembling fingers, I hit *Yes.* 

*When the dog wouldn’t stop sniffing around its grave, did you confess to your mistake? No.* 

*...Bribe the dog with treats? No.* 

*...Bury the dog next to its grave? Yes.* 

*Last question…* 

*When you buried it, did you know it was still alive? Trying to gasp for help through a crushed windpipe and the wet soil its brother methodically shoveled on top of it?* 

I gasped, tears streaming silently down my face as I hit *No.* 

The game whirred. *Calculating… my guess is…* 

*You killed me Charlie you killed me YOU KILLED ME AND NOW YOU’RE GOING TO PAY—* 

I dropped the 20Q console, my hands shaking. I was suddenly struck by how long the shadows were against the bedroom wall. Just how much time had passed while I was absorbed in the game’s questions? I was acutely aware of the smell of freshly turned soil drifting in through my brother’s bedroom window. 

Outside in the backyard, my mother screamed."

Every 2 o'clock in the morning, someone would knock at the door, and I would always leave my computer and go to the door as fast as I can. The knocking would continue until I twist the door knob open. Whenever I opened the door, there would be no one there. This would happen every single night, and I would go and open the door each and every time.

It's so tiring and irritating, and yet I would always go and check. I just don't like the idea of having someone wait for me. Who am I to do that? I'm just a nobody.

I didn't pay it any mind, but not until I began to get busy with schoolworks. I started to need sleep, and someone's sleep-depriving prank needed to stop. So, I set up a hidden camera outside my apartment to find out who the prankster really is. 

I waited and waited for the clock to tick to 2 AM. When it finally did, the prankster started to knock again just as I expected it. However, unlike previous nights, I decided not to open the door until the prankster would grow tired and leave. Instead, I just sat on my computer chair, silently laughing as I took my revenge. I felt so fulfilled, but not until the prankster started banging.

I started to feel worried and terrified. So, to not make things worse, I went to the door to face whoever is on the other side. Again, there was no one there. I feel like the prankster was watching from somewhere near, smiling as he watched me fell to his prank again. So, to get back on him, I bluntly walked to the trash can where I hid my camera. I then went back in with the camera in my hand, smirking as I take the last laugh.

I immediately turned my computer on and inserted my camera's memory card to upload the video online. I located the file on my computer and started to play the video. The feeling of fulfillment turned to fear as goose bumps creeped over my whole body while I watched it. 

There was no one there. No one. Just the knocking, banging, and a voice saying, ""Open the door!"""

hey,
remember how we got here?
you walked up to me n said you liked my shoes
I thought it was bold
I told you I appreciated the effort
but you didn't take no for an answer..
I liked that

you kept walking 10feet behind me
cos I said I wanted to walk alone
and you said we could walk alone together
it was clever
I liked that

you kept hanging around me
I missed your company when you weren't there
when we layed under the stars 
I kept pointing at red suns
did you like that?

we were in the woods
in a cabin you went to great lengths to acquire
you told me you wanted me
I told you I wasn't ready
you tried to hold me and I pushed you

I was outside, in a clearing I had found
you found me, held your hands up to show your resignation
tried to apologize
but you must have cut yourself when I pushed you
you were bleeding

blood.
it was all I saw
everything went red

now here we are 
you, eviscerated, with your last moment ov utter horror frozen on your lifeless face
me, bathed in your blood with your entrails hanging from my neck like an aesthetic piece
holding your gouged eyeball and watching the blood drop down to your rosy cheeks

""I can never remember my dreams.""

He says this all the time. Whenever anyone asks or brings up their own dreams. He wishes he could remember, they're always there, right in the corner of his mind, so close he feels like he could pick them up and display them like a nighttime show-and-tell.   


But every time he tries, they disappear into a haze. Gone again.   


Which means he's safe.   


I've protected him.   


One more night.   


Of course, I always let some slip through, the ones he can see, the nice ones, the pretty ones, even the awful ones that make him sweat and cry out like he did when he was a child.   


But not all of them.

I'll never let him have all of them.  


And then he wakes, and I breathe a sigh of relief when I see him struggle to remember. I watch as they disappear again.   


Because if he does remember...

If he remembers, even for a moment, even if he can pull one image from what he was sent in the night, he'll summon it. The thing that waits to be called, the one that's always knocking throughout the night, the creature of twisted skin and reaching fingers and eyes that never blink.

The shadow that's been terrifying him since he was a child, even if he doesn't know or can't remember what it is.   


So, I remain, vigilant. Every night.   


*Every* night.  


But I'm so tired, and every night it gets harder to stay awake. It's getting harder to do what needs to be done.

I need to make sure, every morning, he doesn't remember his dreams. That he doesn't remember. That he can never remember. 

He can never remember.   


But I'm just so tired..."

“What locker?” Cindy asked.

“Well,” my Craig continued, “there’s supposed to be a locker here that makes people vanish.”

“That’s bullshit, Craig, and you know it,” Jerry cut in.

“Nah, man, I heard it from Thomas Wilkins!”

“Thomas Wilkins’s a liar and you know it!” Jerry retorted.

“Shut up, you idiots, what if someone hears us?” Lydia shushed them.

They both turned to her, only now realizing how loud their voices had echoed through the building.

For a moment, no one said a word, but all stayed quiet.

“Really, I can’t with you two, why are you arguing like that?”

“I told him about the mysterious locker,” Craig answered her.

Lydia rolled her eyes. “God, not that again.”

“What’s it all about?” Cindy pipped up.

She seemed to be the only one who hadn’t heard about that silly urban legend.

“All right,” Craig started in an ominous voice, prompting Lydia and Jerry to share a short, annoyed look.

“As the story goes, a couple of years ago, a group of teenagers snuck into this very pool at night for a swim.”

“That’s just like-“

“Yeah, Cindy, just like us. One of them, Andrew Miller, got so drunk he passed out. So his friends played a little trick on him. They locked him up in one of the lockers here, locker 207, and left him there for the night. The next morning, the locker was empty and Andrew was never seen again. He’d up and vanished.”

“What a bunch of bullshit,” Jerry mumbled.

“Oh yeah? You’ve heard about Andrew going missing, right?”

“I heard he skipped town and-“ Lydia started.

“Yeah, because no one ever talks about what really happened!”

“No one but you, anyway. So, where’s this mysterious locker?” Jerry asked.

Craig grinned and led them to the boy’s changing room and to an old locker with the number 207 written on it.

“Well, here it is, the mysterious locker!”

“Mysterious my ass,” Jerry cursed, pushed him aside, and ripped open the door.

What he found behind was nothing but a completely normal, albeit slightly rusty, locker.

Jerry reached his hand inside, shaking his arm, putting on a mockingly shocked expression.

“Oh no, Craig, look, the locker’s got me! Help, I’m going to be vanished away!”

Lydia started laughing, and even Cindy giggled a little. Craig, on the other hand, stared at Jerry in anger.

“Why don’t you go in for real?” Craig asked.

Jerry blurted out laughing and shrugged.

“Sure.”

With that, he stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind himself.

“Oh no guys, help, there’s-“

But he broke up when the locker suddenly started rumbling and shaking.

“Hey Craig, stop, what the hell are you doing?” he called out, trying to push the door open again, but it didn’t budge.

When he tried for the handle it wasn’t there and in sheer terror, he realized there was no sign of a door ever existing at all."

It was hard for her to get friends. No one could understand her.

But she managed. She was happy. 9 years old and thriving. She had great grades and was a nice little girl. Always willing to give others a helping hand, despite her young age and size. 

Then little miss deaf girl learned how to read lips. How tragic. She was so excited, too.

Her first heartbreak was when she realized her parents truly hated her. They walked around the house with cheerful smiles on their faces whilst shouting obscenities about their ""deaf and dumb"" daughter. 

She pretended she didn't know. How painful it must've been. She couldn't even look at her parents after that, afraid of what she would see them say.

Her second heartbreak was when she was with her friends. Out in the courtyard, recess at school. Five of them sitting at a table.

One turns and says to the rest of the group, unaware that the deaf little girl sitting two feet away from them can understand, ""why do we still hang out with this creep? All she does is follow us around like a lost puppy. How pathetic!"" The group burst out laughing while the heartbroken girl's smile faded and tears sprung to her eyes.

Why didn't they like her? Why did everyone assume she was dumb? That she was pathetic? She did everything they asked, she got good grades, why couldn't they just like her?

...

She was desperate. 

Regret. Mostly. And pain. A knife, covered in blood, lay beside her leg, a menacing reminder of what she'd done.

The faint, murmuring noise coming from the living room didn’t let him sleep. He was thinking about the old lady in the living room.

Richard’s parents were out for the night and had asked the old lady to look after him for the night. Normally, Charlotte used to babysit him. Although he didn’t like to be babysat, he was nine after all, but Charlotte was nice. But she suddenly broke her leg today morning and couldn’t come. His parents were anxious that they wouldn’t find a babysitter when the old lady volunteered herself.

The more Richard thought, the more suspicious he felt. He didn’t even know the old lady’s name. Everyone just called her Grandma. She was relatively new in the neighborhood and had moved into the dingy old house at the end of the street. She always kept to herself and did not talk to any of her neighbors.

When she came over in the evening before Richard’s parents left, she asked his parents a strange question – she asked Richard’s age. When they said nine, only Richard noticed a weird grin on her face. She asked the same question again to Richard before sending him off to sleep. She insisted on telling him a bedtime story. Richard wasn’t a big fan of bedtime stories, and Charlotte never did all this stupid stuff. But Grandma kept insisting.

She took out an ancient, dusty book from her bag and told a bizarre story. It was a story of a boy named Eddie who was taken by the Sleep Ghost because he was disobedient. He tried to sneak and look at the pages but could not see any text. It was just the picture of a boy wearing a red shirt. Grandma quickly closed the book and asked Richard to sleep.

Slowly, the noise from the living room started increasing. Richard sneakily got off from his bed and started walking towards the living room as quietly as possible. The living room was lit in a devilish red light and in the middle of it sat Grandma, facing her back towards him, rocking gently on a chair and chanting something. Richard was going to turn around and run for his room when she said in an ominous tone, “Didn’t I tell you what happens to disobedient kids and started crawling towards him on all fours.

You guys are slow. You are making my job much easier than it should be. I suppose you want this, thank you for the opportunity, I appreciate your generosity in facilitating my dreams. Although, I do theorize even if you had the most magnificent force there is known-to-man, your capture of me would still fall short. 

White Rose Slayer.

Finally. I did not anticipate the length it would take me to use a typewriter, you thought I’d be used to it by now but it seems I have found my weakness. I sighed at the thought of having to wait another week before my next kill, however in the meantime I have been searching for my next few victims and meeting up with the ‘unlucky’ few. I don’t like to call them victims, nor unlucky. If anything I am helping them. We all die, and what happens after death? Nothing. I will be forgotten, you will be forgotten, everyone on this earth will be forgotten. Unless of course, you become well-known before your passing. I am helping them achieve this notoriety, they are being blessed by becoming a ‘victim’ of the world's most remarkable, outstanding, renowned serial killer in American History. They will be in history books, TV shows, movie-remakes, everyone will mourn them. I am helping them. Therefore I no longer refer to them as such. 

I cannot wait to meet the next. Evangeline. Such a graceful name, I wonder how graceful she’ll look in her final hours of life. The blood trickling down her chest onto the perfectly laid white rose, staining it. Her earrings in the photo facing me are dangly; I can only hope she wears these to the date, pulling them out and ripping her flesh away will be one of my most memorable moments. She is the prettiest girl I have seen, as of yet, her chestnut eyes compliment her fair, delicate skin that shows off her perfect rose in her cheeks. I cannot wait to watch it fade as I pull the knife up to her throat. Her wispy, black hair that falls perfectly to her shoulders make her look so...heavenly. 

There’s a long list of criteria they must fit in order to be honoured by my kill. Single, child-less, weak, introverted. Partners, children, strength, friends, everything of that sorts gets in my way and prevents me from my work. I make sure to watch them for a few months before arranging to see them, just to make extra sure that they will not mess up my plan.

‘Hey Evangeline, I’ll be waiting outside for you. 8pm? -Arthur’."

You look down, and eternity stretches beneath you. Deep-sea diving is like that, no sign of a sea-floor.

50 meters.

Even through the wetsuit, the water is freezing. At this depth, the light from above was dim. There is no sign of life except your own blood whooshing through your arteries, and the Vader-esque hiss of your regulator proving you were still breathing.

The flash to the left of your vision, silver. Looked to be a salmon of some sort. Probably interested by the solitary human diver and lone boat overhead. Well, at least it wasn’t a shark, or worse.

200 meters.

You flick on your dive lights.

300 meters.

White beams project themselves into the darkness, illuminating nothing but particles suspended in the water.

Greyness begins to appear in front of you, it grows until it fills your vision. You feel the displacement of the water as you are pulled along by its gargantuan form.

Huh. Rare to find a sperm whale this high.

The tank is getting low now. The regulator struggles to push oxygen into you against the enormity of the pressure outside. You can feel it pushing in on your body, squeezing it like a middle-aged divorcee rock climber with a recent cancer diagnosis squeezes a stress ball.

The whale seems to be following you, what an inquisitive creature.

500 meters.

The tank is out of oxygen now. Your next breath is met with… nothing.

What remains in your lungs is being compressed. You suppose it’s time now. The whale seems to have decided to abandon the pursuit, perhaps it was running out of air. How similar your situations are.

Are you a whale also? No, you’re a human.

Damned nitrogen narcosis.

Still, the weights pulled you further below.

600 meters.

You’ve done well to hold your breath for this long. You can hardly tell which way is up anymore apart from the dragging of the lead on your suit.  
Darkness below, darkness above. Suspended in the abyss. 

Surely this is what death is like. Perhaps you are the first person to really experience it before you died.

Only one way to know for sure.

You feel the air leave your lungs, replaced by frigid seawater as you spasm and your brain screams for air, the salinity tearing your delicate lung tissue apart as if lava poured down your trachea.

The first breath is always the hardest."

kc4tu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kc4tu8/we_dont_know_how_anaesthesia_works/,We don’t know how anaesthesia works,336,25,1607836407.0,"Sounds weird when you hear it first, but since 1846 we’ve been using general anaesthesia to knock people out during surgery, without knowing why exactly they’re  knocked out. We anaesthetists have to train for at least seven years, in addition to normal med school, to learn the “trade” as it were. We learn a lot about various anaesthetics, methods of administering them, how to survey the level of alertness and consciousness of patients during procedures etc. What we don’t really spend much time on during our training is the theory behind how anaesthesia works. Sure we have classes on it, with some of the most popular, often contradictory, theories being discussed, but ultimately we don’t spend too much time on them, because we still don’t know how it works. We only know that anaesthetics knock you out and mess with consciousness “somehow”.

Most of my colleagues were pretty hard core pragmatists in that regard. I myself was always deeply fascinated by the topic and tried to make a point on always staying up to date with the latest research. We seem to be getting closer to an answer and maybe through that we might find out more answers on how consciousness works or what it even is…another thing we basically have no idea about. Fascinating stuff all of that, don’t you think?

In addition to my intellectual musings regarding the topic of anaesthesia and consciousness I acquired a weird obsession with being knocked out myself. 

Today I have another surgery scheduled, not for work mind you, I’m having a procedure done on myself. Partial Colectomy. My diet was horrible, which in addition to stress caused severe ulcers. Now while most people would dread such an operation, I was pretty relaxed knowing that the procedure wouldn’t be all that dangerous and more than that I was excited! Another chance to experience anaesthesia firsthand. It wasn’t my first surgery and I have to say I welcomed any future one. Which might be one of the reasons I didn’t really take good care of myself.

The knife cuts through me with ease and my flesh parts with a searing sensation. Mind breaking pain floods my entire system and my spirit thrashes and howls, but I can’t move. I can’t even open my eyes and I know for a fact that my heartrate is low and my breath constant. Nevertheless, I feel everything. While the knife cuts deeper and deeper I curse god. Why do I have to be among the people awaking during surgery? Why is that dilatant not seeing anything on the monitor? 

Then it hits me. It worked… by making you forget. All those times I had realized it and all those times I had forgotten the secret. You don’t lose consciousness, you merely forget. 

I feel hands entering me and I want to scream the secret out, just to save my future self, but more than that I only want to forget."

I saw it.

It was just for an instant, but I saw it. Dr. \[Redacted\] was with me in the lab when I saw it. Though she said she wasn’t paying attention when it happened.

Its description matches those we had received in the last few months. Only some parts of it can be seen. Long lanky arms with protruding bones for fingers, sickly yellow scaled skin. And a face with no teeth only sharp lips that were rotting.

Its history begins as all do in this area. Born out of the ether at the birth of Kalkun in the so-called “Birth of Creation” that is only written of in passing.

This non-hostile creature is disturbing and I doubt i can sleep tonight knowing I’m its target of stalking this week.

I was wrong. It’s dangerous.

I was placed in Quarantine after I became “Infected” with DmITm-4.first three days had gone by the script. Stalking in mirrors, in the corner of your eyes. There was a movement in my every turn and every mirror.

But on the third day, things were different. For whatever reason, DmITm-4 knew we were watching it. And it didn’t like it one bit. That night, I had nightmares made of reflections of death. My body was torn and my mind was burned with the images of my end. And in the morning I was marked with what we theorize is its hunting mark. A set of four scratches in a whirling pattern with the center and a small bump filled with a strange substance that analysis concluded is not any natural creation.

I only hope this only means nightmare and not anything worse.

It’s no longer just a reflection. I see it everywhere. The corners of my cell are its living grounds in the day and the night it is in my mind giving me dreams of death and torture. It’s after blood and it wants it now. I only hope I can last this two more days. Two more days and I’m free.

I’ll finally be back with them.

July 27th, 20XX- \[Redacted\], California- CoC Reserch Station #5

It’s not a reflection.

It’s much worse.

I now see why others cannot see it. It’s not in the mirror, it is not in the corners. It’s in me. My eyes. My soul.

I’ve been told that if I’m to find a way to eliminate it I am to do it immediately.

But, how do you destroy something that resides in the soul, your essence?

I know that answer. The answer is death. Death of not just you, but your soul, your very existence. 

I know it’s horrid to think about, but yes it’s true.

I hope that I can do this in time. At least with this, there is now one more horror that they shall not see."

There is a teenage girl floating in the pool with jeans and a shirt on. She’s very still. It takes me a minute to process that she might be dead. As I’m staring for several minutes she jerks up and twists her head and instantly locates me and stares. 

I jump back as I got a jolt of fear and went to get my husband to see what I just saw. 8 seconds later we look out and the pool is empty. There is no way she could have got out and away so fast.

So I went to the dentist as usual and got an exam done but he said nothing showed up on the X-rays. He shrugged and it said it must just be a tiny air pocket, told me to brush thoroughly, floss, and avoid sugar.   


""Come back if it gets bigger,"" he said.  


So I went back home, pushed it out of my mind and went about my day as usual. I worked on some code for tomorrow's work, cooked myself some salmon and asparagus with fried rice, and settled down on the couch to watch some Netflix.  


I woke up in the pitch dark to feel my teeth tingling madly, and I felt a huge vibrating sensation in my entire lower jaw. I ran to the bathroom and shined a flashlight in my mouth.

There are well-attested tales of guillotined men and women blinking, smiling, comprehending.

Six seconds is the most widely-believed figure. Six seconds of circulation, of breath, of recognition. You could see your own dead body, if your head bounces the right way round. That's something to look forward to. 

Growing up, I devoured anything and everything I could on the subject. My teachers thought me morbid. My mother despaired.

Scientists scoff at the subject. ""Death is near-instantaneous"", they say. ""You wouldn't sense a thing."" Such closed-minds. So pathetic.

The evidence is clear, though. Usually recorded by witnesses bearing testimony whilst heads rolled in revolutionary France.

Heads in baskets, frantically mouthing final goodbyes. To lovers, to families. To the world.

I suppose it was only a matter of time before I made the ultimate sacrifice. Tried it for myself.

Courage is all that's required. Today I'm going to be braver than most people will ever bring themselves to be. 

Today I'm going to find out for myself. To see with my own eyes, just how long a severed head can survive.

I ruled out a guillotine. Wildly impractical. Knives are too flimsy. No, it'll have to be by axe. 

No hiding behind the flipping of a switch, like a gas-chamber coward. No, I'll have to swing with all of my might. 

And I can't cop out. Can you imagine a botched job? The mess that would make. And the pain.

So much unnecessary suffering. 

So much terror.

Even a few moments ago, I was racked with doubts. I wasn't sure I could go through with this.

But there's no going back. Everything is arranged. I've written a letter, to try to explain my actions. Though I doubt the world will fully understand my deep, searing need to do this to myself. Sorry, Mom.

I've created a distraction. A favorite pastime. No time for fear. 

Found the perfect location, too. Nobody knows I'm here.

I'm swinging now, in practice. Once, twice, three times. Stopping just behind the delicate neck.

Goodbye.

This is it. I'm going through with it.

Don't pity me.

Just keep reading. No turning back.

It started a week ago. I awoke from my usual deep sleep, and headed to the kitchen. At first, it sounded like white noise. Quickly, it turned from a slight ring, to a soft whisper. I figured it was from all the stress. I’m set to preform Chopin’s “Nocturne in E Flat Major (Op. 9 No 2)” tomorrow. I had begun practicing just a little over 3 days before the voice started. It had to be from stress, right?

At first, it echoed gently throughout my brain. Easy to ignore, but annoying. I couldn’t quite hear what it was saying, but I knew instinctively that it didn’t want me to look in a mirror. So I didn’t. It wasn’t until the first time I sat down at my piano that it became loud enough to make out. “Rip off your nails.” The words were so loud it drowned out every note of the piano. For two days I tried to play, but I couldn’t. All I could hear was that grueling, taunting voice. 

So I did. I ripped off each nail, one by one. Pulling them off like newly formed scabs. Slowly, but surely. I sat down at my piano, for the first time in days, it was silent. I played so furiously and violently, I think even Chopin would’ve been scared. But I hit every note, despite the blood all over the keys.

The next two days were riddled with only one demand. Loud and clear. “Don’t look in the mirror.” Every night I would dream I would look though, just a glance. Every night it was the same figure, tall and dark, soulless eyes and bleeding ears, deformed and inhuman, hovering over me. Strings attached to my arms, and the figure moves me like a puppet. I wake up. I won’t look in the mirror. 

By day seven, I was confident enough to sit down and practice. The voice told me I could. This was my reward for not eating for three days. I also pulled every eyelash out one by one because the voice told me to. I broke each finger individually, so the voice would let me practice. I sliced my hands until they were mangled, so the voice would let me play. 

The competition is tomorrow, and I wasn’t going to let this ridiculous voice take that performance away from me. I don’t believe in ghosts, but after all of this, what else could it be? Why was it choosing me? How was this even real? I couldn’t stand it anymore. So I looked. I looked in the mirror. 

I saw the it. It stared right back at me. The figure that plagued my ability to play. I saw it. I saw the demon that riddled my ability to be the best. I saw the demon. And it was me."

The son dead and looking shocked that he died, was hugging himself, like he was trying to stop the intestines from snaking out, but they still slipped through his arms and coiled onto the floor. The father’s throat was slit, that’s where his hands held a death grip, tight, cause he was trying to stop the bleeding, but it also kind of looked like he was choking himself out. Of course, the bleeding eventually stopped, as did his heart. 

She was spotted leaving their house. A neighbor said she was naked and may have been crawling like a dog. 

A group of teenagers, boys, were discovered the next day, but it took a whole other day and night to gather all their limbs. 

Next were the Gonzalez brothers. They were twins, conjoined at the head, until they weren’t. Until they were pulled apart, like the splitting of a wishbone, except neither won over the other, their shared skull cleanly bifurcated down the center. A saw lay near them, dirty with neural matter. Also, their jeans were pulled down to their ankles as if they were expecting fellatio.

Some people thought she was a demon spit out from hell. Or a witch. But she was probably just a serial killer passing through. 

I thought that until she came to us. She walked naked in the moonlight until in the light of our bonfire. 

We should have been frightened, but she was just too beautiful. 

I could smell liquid lust sweating off my friends. It made my lips curl.

Joel was first to speak, he said, “Hey cutie. Are you cold? Want me to warm you up?” He snickered and rubbed his crotch. 

“She don’t want your four-inch bro. She wants a real man, right sweety?” Daniel said. 

“Fuck off,” I told my friends. Hearing them made my brain throb like a hornets nest. My heart buzzed like an insect.   

A beer bottle was thrown, and it broke against Daniel’s temple.  

He must have thought it was me because he grabbed a shard and opened up my gut like he was looking for something. I fell and listened to Joel and Daniel struggle like two boys over a toy. 

\*\*\*

I’m still laying here, Joel is sweating off his skin in the bonfire, laying there crying, crackling to the night sky. Daniel appears to be asleep, but no, his head is facing the wrong direction.    

*She* hasn’t moved at all. She looks indifferent, like she’s seen this all too many times. 

“I’m sorry,” I tell her because it must be tiring being so beautiful. To watch men destroy each other for her.

She looks at me, it’s all I wanted. 

And her hair, as black as what I hope death is like, full lips that curve the space around it, and star dust eyes that can disrupt a world, are all I see before closing my eyes for an eternal sleep."

Alex was a mixed bag, sometimes he was fun to hang out with, but sometimes he was a jerk. He was always telling me about all this inappropriate stuff that he learned in middle school and would swear a lot when grandma wasn’t around.

“Oh please grandma’s scared of everything. Look, I’m gonna sneak out, do you wanna follow me or not?”

I hesitated for a second, but it looked like Alex was going no matter what. I decided to follow him, partly cause I was worried for him but partly cause I wanted to impress him.

Ultimately, I ended up following him and felt the cool air of night for the first time ever. My eyes practically glowed as I looked at all the stars above me. Even the boring cornfields seemed to have a different energy at night. As we walked along the road Alex began talking.

“Enjoying the view?” asked Alex.

“Yeah, this is awesome.”

“I know it’s fucking beautiful out here. See you can’t let fear control you all the time. Sometimes you gotta take risks. You don’t seem like much of a risk taker to be honest.”

I shook my head.

“Why don’t you try saying, fuck then?”

“Uh.. I don’t know, maybe…”

“Come on, I won’t tell just say it.”

“Ok….fuck.”

“No louder.”

“FUCK.” I shouted.

“That’s my cousin!”

Alex started laughing, and I laughed too. That was until I saw a tall fleshy figure looming over Alex.

The two of them marveled at how the wife’s skin was flawless, not a single scar left. Piercing shrieks soon followed when she went to change. While the right side of her body was clean, the left side was covered in scars and other skin deformities. It hadn’t truly gone away. 

Throughout the day, the husband did his best to console her. She appreciated it, in fact, his comforting skills seemed to have exponentially improved overnight. However, she found herself needing a nap by the afternoon.

She chalked up his odd behavior to him being in a bad headspace. Though, something was indeed wrong. He was doting in the day, but cold in the nights.

Even as they adjusted to their circumstances, they did receive what they wished for. She got his love, he got her skin to be better, they had to be content. The wishbone was split evenly, and you can’t grant two wishes for the cost of one."

I could see my each breath I took in front of me as the cold washed over me. 

I took my first deep step into the snow, followed by another. And then I stopped. There, in the middle of the perfectly white lawn, was a patch of red. My eyes were transfixed on it is it thinned out into droplets in the direction of my garage, that was slightly ajar. 

I slowly and deliberately opened the door to the garage. The droplets continued into the middle of the room before they made an immediate halt. There, in the middle of the room, was a perfectly placed brown box with a ribbon attached. It had been out there with such precision. 

""Mom! Dad!"" I screamed. I was frozen in fear and all I could do was scream. I backed up against the wall and continued to scream for my mom and dad. Nothing. Not a sound. They couldn't hear me. I turned to leave the garage but the door had shut begind me. 

""Open the box"" I heard from somewhere in the room. The light suddenly switched off. ""Open the box, now."" I slowly edged towards the box and as I got to it the light switched on. There was a gift tag attached that read ""Merry Christmas! They won't be able to hear you"". As my eyes welled and my vision blurred from the tears, I opened the box and saw 4 ears surrounded by blood. I dropped to my knees as the light turned back off, and I heard the sound of footsteps approaching me."

That sounds bad, let me explain.



Father Davis always seemed to be close with the kids at my school, the parents never had a problem with him.



That was because he always made sure none of the kids would tell them what was going on.



Father Davis claimed that a man of God murdered in sin would return as a monster, possessed by his own vices, and extract vengeance on those that wronged him. He told us that this was where demons would come from, and why it was so important to be better than our enemies. If we killed them, they would return for revenge years later. 



We were kids, this seemed reasonable. 



As far as I know, he got to everyone in my class at least once for his rituals. He’d borrow students for “private study” and they’d come back looking frightened. Father Davis explained to the teachers that the word of God can sometimes be scary, especially to the innocent. 



I’m not sure if they were ignorant of what was going on, or just ignored it. Either way, I do not forgive them. 



He told us that if we told any adults, he’d be killed, and his spirit would haunt us. So we all kept quiet. 



I don’t know why it had to be me that did something. I wish it hadn’t been, but it was. 



I stayed after school one day with Rebecca, we needed to study for a history test, when we noticed Father Davis escorting a new student to the chapel. 



We called him over, asking if he could help us study. He hid his annoyance and walked to the staircase, showing the new kid away.



As he got to the top, I stood up and pushed him down while Rebecca screamed. I don’t know why the urge came over me; maybe it was seeing the new kid, still unaware. Father Davis hit the bottom with a sickening thud, and he was still. 



We both claimed he had just fallen, and the police bought our story. We promised to each other we’d never tell what we did, and then we went on with our lives. Over the years, more and more students from my school came forward with accusations, as we had accepted his lies of returning from the dead once we got older.  



Then we started disappearing. 



Rebecca kept tabs on other students. She sent me an email last week, claiming to see a dark figure in a robe stalking her, grinning in the distance. She says he is bleeding from his head, licking his lips with a whip-like tongue, and has more and more limbs everytime she sees him. 



I invited her to come stay with me for a little, but she didn’t respond. 



What she saw couldn’t be real. 



Because if it is, that means the dark man I’ve been seeing is real too. "

Mother crawls jangling to a village and comes back with less jewelry and a wailing child cradled in her pedipalps. She returns singing. She sings not from her breathless mouth, but in disharmonies from the lung-holes on her abdomen. I’m not sure how she barters for the bands that ring her legs, but I can only think of one thing that a village would want to buy from her. I imagine the warriors’ laughter as they dip arrowheads into venom milked from her fangs.

We tended to her eggs. We saw her offspring through the glassy membranes. Their spots were cute. They reminded us of blossoming tiger lilies. Like us, they required constant care to keep them at the right temperature and humidity and free of parasites. Unlike us, they got that care.

We were only fed leftovers. We had neither shelter nor canopy to protect us from the elements. We were covered in sunburns and fungal infections. Athlete’s foot and jock itch were endemic, and I went weeks without seeing a healthy fingernail. We were small and sick, but kids still ran. Mother had lines of silk everywhere. She didn’t use venom on runaways. They felt it when she chewed them. We were only fed leftovers.

One day, Mother brought a new boy to us. He told us that he was the survivor of another nest. We knew that Mother’s offspring would eat us when they hatched, but he said that mothers offer themselves to be eaten, too. He said that his old mother looked happy before they bit her eyes off. When they were done with their mother and his coworkers, they were full. They just walked passed him and disappeared into the jungle. He was left alone in the clearing beside an exoskeleton wrapped in gold. He found his way home, and his parents sold him again to the next spider to stop by his village. While he was there, he learned to make fire.

I never would have agreed to his plan if he hadn’t told me that mothers sacrifice themselves for their children. I had thought that Mother was just evil, but there was kindness in her, just not for me.

The plan worked. Silk burns fast. The fire spread to every corner of the web, up our bodies. Mother had strands on us so fine that we never would have been able to pull them off. Mother burned, too. Her eggs boiled and burst.

We scattered. I wandered eating fruit from trees and drinking water from streams until I came to an egg. The monster inside had more legs than Mother. I didn’t just tend to it. I told it my story. I wept. For the first time, I had a friend. I imagined riding it into my village feeding my parents to it.

When it hatched, it stung me. “Just as your mother planned,” I thought."

It would be one of those nights, he thought with a sigh.

For a while, he browsed Netflix before he watched a few funny videos on Netflix.

Before long he grew bored with funny fail compilations and silly jokes and he hit up a few more... adult-themed pages.

While he was browsing and checking videos, a new tab opened out of nowhere.

“Freaking pop-up bullshit,” he cursed in annoyance.

He was about to close the tab when a video started to play. A feeling of apprehension washed over him and he froze.

This video was different from what he’d expected.

What he saw on his computer screen was his very face, sitting in his room at this very desk.

At first, he was perplexed, then scared, then utterly confused. He didn’t own a webcam, never had, and told himself he never would. So how in the hell was this even possible?

His eyes wandered to the position where the camera would’ve to be, but there was... nothing. All there was, was the bleak, white wall.

He returned his attention to the screen, unnerved before he got an idea. He leaned forward, blinked, then moved his head from left to right.

Instead of following suit, his alter ego seemed to continue browsing.

A recording then, he realized. Was this some kind of joke by one of his friends? But why’d they do that and more importantly, HOW?

As he watched the video, his alter ego was clicking, moving the mouse, and every once in a while entering something via the keyboard.

Then the footage changed. His alter ego’s face grew annoyed as it mouthed a curse. Then it grew apprehensive before confusion washed over it.

For a while his alter ego stared directly at the camera, focusing on it before his attention returned to the screen.

John watched himself leaning forward, watched himself blink before he saw something else from the back of the room.

While his alter ego on the screen moved his head left and right, he saw how the closet was pushed open.

At first, there was nothing there, but then a mass of shadows seemed to seep from it.

John’s eyes grew wide as the shadowy mass contorted and waver before it formed into a vaguely human shape. Long, pale, spidery limbs pushed from the darkness, their proportions all wrong. Then a head followed, a white, pale head. It was entirely smooth, but then the skin tore apart, revealing a ghastly, gorging maw.

On the screen, the creature inched closer towards his alter ego. John’s heart was beating in his chest. He started sweating, shaking, and told him it was nothing but a fake.

Yet, when he finally closed the damned video, he felt long spidery fingers close around his shoulders and he felt a disgustingly warm breath on his neck."
kbqvvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kbqvvy/sometimes_i_talk_to_my_salad/,Sometimes I talk to my salad,281,35,1607786865.0,"If it’s true that “you are what you eat,” then I’m a salad.
 
I just love a good, fresh salad. I especially like how the ingredients of the salad can be so different from one another and are delicious in their own right. Some pieces of salad are crunchy, while others are bursting with juices. Most of the time I’ll eat it raw, with no sauces or dressing. Yeah, I know…I get a lot of grief about this, but it’s healthier and I enjoy the taste of every unique part. 

If you were to visit my kitchen, you’d see how serious I am about my salads. I have almost every type of razor-sharp knife and chopping appliance known to man. In fact, there is a massive rack that extends the length of one wall, where each item is on display and easily accessible. That’s important. I don’t want to be fumbling around for my tools when I have a hankering for veggies. My granite countertops are wide and open so I have ample workspace. As for my refrigerator and freezer—well, let’s just say I have a minimum of two of each. 

While there are very few downsides to salad consumption, I would say the hardest part is the preparation. Getting that whole mess of salad up on my counter, while parts of it are trying to escape and get away from me—it can be difficult. I’ve had to build up some serious muscle to manage it. After I wrestle it all down and get to my favorite part, chopping, it becomes more manageable. I go straight up berserk-mode when I’m slicing and dicing. It’s a great stress-reducer. 

Still, there are times when the salad just doesn’t want to cooperate. If I haven’t sufficiently pre-prepped the salad, I have to spend time talking to it. Yes, you read that right: I often have to talk to my salad. Imagine that you have an overwhelming craving for some savory, juicy veggies, then you have to convince the salad that it is a salad. I say, *you have consumed nothing but all-natural, plant-based products*, and it has the nerve to talk back to me, saying, *But I have a family!*, *my mommy and daddy are going to miss me!*, or *We just got married!* That’s nice and all, and I’m for equal salad rights, but they don’t trump my own needs. Salad’s purpose is to nourish and to get in my belly.

Last weekend, I was violently struggling with this rather tall pile of salad and it was arguing that it wasn’t a salad and that it was something else. I told it to shut up because one salad knows another. 

I have to say, though, that specific salad made a good point and is making me reconsider my earlier statement about “being what you eat.” I would now say you should take into consideration what your food labels itself. With that mindset, I’d have to say I’m a vegan."

She struggled upright and onto the edge of the bed as a creeping pain throbbed through her skull, trying to make heads or tails of the fuzzy memories of the night before.

Seeing the neat, unoccupied space next to her on the bed gave way to the realisation that it was likely a messy one. Ben hadn’t come to their bed overnight. 

Another three weeks sobriety down the pan. 

She lifted herself off the bed, intending to grovel as best she could muster in the state she was in. Pain ripped through her head, forcing her to spill her guts onto the wood floor. With tunnel vision, she half tripped to the bedroom door. Time to face Ben.

Stumbling through the hall, Claire stopped outside the closed bathroom door and knocked. It was unusual for the door to be closed when unoccupied so she assumed Ben was in there, but he refused to answer her. 

‘Ben? Please talk to me.’ 

She stood for a minute, waiting on his response, but unsurprisingly nothing came from the other side of the door. 

This was their tri-weekly ritual. She’d have to face his silent treatment for the day or god knows how long. She knew she was pushing him away with her behaviour, but even worse she felt she was pushing him towards his own relapse, which would end much worse than her night on the liquor. 

Rubbing her temples she settled on a peace offering of coffee and breakfast for when Ben had finished up in the bathroom. 

She was shocked to see him sat on the couch, his tired eyes staring wide as she stood in the entrance to the lounge. He looked bugged out. Her face fell as she feared she’d already pushed him to his breaking point.

‘Oh! I thought you were in the bathroom. Listen Ben, I don’t know what happened last night and I....’ 

The words died on her lips as he stood abruptly, bug-eyed and shaking, his gaze not on her, but glaring into the hall. He was totally out of it.
Stalking towards her, he barrelled through the doorway, missing her by inches as she threw herself out of his path.

Ben stood with his forehead resting on the bathroom door. ‘It can’t be,’ he muttered, his hand shaking on the brass knob.

‘Ben, what did you do?’

 No reply.

’Ben..’ She placed her hand on his shoulder, and he jumped as though he'd been electrocuted, eyes darting every direction but hers. 

He threw open the door and bolted to the sink, frantically splashing his face with cold water and muttering incoherently. Claire stalked in after him. She watched him rise, trembling, to stare into the mirror above the sink. 

But it wasn’t her concerned eyes he met in the mirrored glass, for her reflection wasn’t where it was meant to be.

It was behind her, slumped in the bathtub with blood-clotted hair."

Specially dyed periwinkle lilies with firm petals layered onto the thick black cloth, the casket being a morbid centerpiece. The sealed box masked the petite corpse of the girl, her mourning flowers providing little decoration.

The Falkner Family now consisted of one person. The father, Tomasino, stood weakly, shaking with anger, his hand clutching the last crimson filled flask etched with runes. He threw it violently at the floor, the liquid inside staining the carpet, soaking the fabric, beginning to steam.

The red stain expanded, moving independently, its pattern forming a pointed face, which wiggled liquidy eyes at Tomasino and grinned widely. Tomasino, normally a stoic man, screamed in animal agony at the damp carpet.

“You vile serpent, you traitorous specter! You promised me my daughter’s life!”

The stain’s mouth moved, and it spoke with the sharpness of a razor and the vastness of an ocean.

“You are truly stupid, human. I did no such thing. A foolish man makes foolish deals. Come. enlighten me, fool.”

“I gave you my land in exchange for her birth!” Tomasino remembered the miscarriages, how he and Vanessa prayed every night to the ancient gods for a child.

“Aye, you did, and I consumed your sickly land, poisoned by your ineptitude and sloth. Your daughter was born as fragile as your harvest, easy to die.” The stain smirked.

“I gave you my luck in exchange for her health!” Tomasino desperately remembered his many misfortunes, the violent thieves, the silver-tongued con men who had robbed his household of what little was left.

“Aye, it’s true, but it was merely a morsel. How fickle luck often is. Easy to lose control of, much like your daughter’s health.” the stain’s smile grew wider.

“I gave you my wife’s sight in exchange for no pain.” Tomasino could not bear to think of Vanessa, how he had sunk his fingers into her skull and pulled out those whitish orbs amidst unyielding screams.

“Aye, you did. Her sight was a lovely dessert. Tell me, human, is Sarah in any pain now? The deal stands, fool. You have lost.” The stain’s face mirrored Tomasino’s face in mock sorrow.

Tomasino knew what it wanted. He knew what he had to say. Gathering up what little courage that remained, he stated those damning words.

“I give my life for Sarah’s. A life for a life, demon. Fulfill the bargain.”

The stain began to evaporate, the red thinning off of the carpet, but its cruel words were the last Tomasino was to ever hear.

“It is done.”

Tomasino’s body crumpled onto the floor, growing cold. No breath echoed in his chest, no flame lit behind his eyes. Tomasino died knowing he had saved his only daughter, the light of his world. He wasn’t alive to hear the muffled pounding and screaming coming from the casket, nor the strained breathing that followed soon after.

He wasn’t alive to see his daughter’s face turn as blue as her mourning lilies."

We identified celestial bodies and traveled toward them. But at each one, we found worlds as dead and barren as ours.

After decades of looking, we found a landing spot. We found hope. There was plenty of land and sustenance for all. It was a place with riches beyond one's wildest imagination. Our world, I realized, had always been lacking. Life had been hard not because we made it that way, but because those were the conditions we were born into. It was our innate condition, imposed by an unknowable creator.

This new world is an evil place. The species here is self-devouring. They kill each other without remorse, standing atop the corpses with pride. They gleefully deprive each other of resources. Knowing better, they destroy the land. Knowing better, they take more than what they need and watch with indifference as others suffer.

Plants are really resilient after all, and exist in even the harshest environments on earth. So finding them on another planet was not unexpected. Well, it was a shock to find life in general, but scientifically it was to be expected. 

The planet the plant was found on a planet dubbed as “Cardinal 5”. 2 lightyears away. You see, all of our telescopes are pointed away from earth, looking in a relatively straight line. It wasn’t until we pointed the space telescopes downward that we found an abundance of other solar systems. And the Cardinal system was one of those solar systems.

Anyways, the fifth planet in the Cardinal system was in the so called “goldilocks” zone. Not to far and not to close to the star. Just right. As soon as scientists detected oxygen, they sent a probe. And what they found made history. The plants had completely black leaves Evolutionary superior to earth plants due to the almost complete absorption of sunlight. Unfortunately, only so much can be deduced by a video, so the probe sent home a sample. 

The black leaves made biological sense. But what didn’t  make sense was the complete lack of anything resembling pollen. It was very well expected that an alien plant wouldn’t completely resemble one from earth. So it was more of a shock considering that one could look at the plant and it immediately identify it as one. What scientists concluded was that it reproduced asexually, not unlike the fern. Using spores as its main method.

Humans aren’t perfect. In fact, the saying “i’m only human” implies that making mistakes is part of our deep rooted identity. The mistake that was made might seem as arbitrary to anyone else. A researcher believed that air filtration wasn’t necessary when dealing with a plant. When the researcher took the plant out of containment, he started to hyperventilate. The suspected spores of the plant were actually the seed, and living things were the fertilizer. It invaded the brain like an addiction. You start to have urges of violence towards others. If you act on those urges, the seed releases an addicting chemical. You eventually get addicted to violence and anger."
kbe0fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kbe0fs/blister/,BLISTER,42,9,1607729540.0,"I have particularly sensitive skin so I am prone to a plethora of skin conditions; eczema, hives, psoriasis - that sort of thing. I am also one of the unlucky bastards to suffer with extreme and horrendous blisters. It doesn’t matter what I’m doing - I will always find the little fluid filled fuckers on various parts of my body. 

You see, I have to wear padded clothes and padded shoes - without the soft interior of the materials, I wouldn’t be able to live my life. It can be so hard sometimes; takes a toll on your mental health you know. I am abhorrent to look at when I have a blister flare up; my face and body perpetually adorned by these detestable puss filled pockets. If I press too hard on them, they burst and an unbearable pain courses through my body. 

Usually, if I’m careful enough I can avoid the agonising pain of a ruptured blister but mostly, I’m not so lucky. Have you ever had the misfortune of popping a red raw, infected blister? When the skin is so taut around it that when it happens, you feel like parts of you are being skinned alive? And once the pus has spurted out like some out of control jet, it slithers across my body like some foul smelling worm and when I think I couldn’t possibly get more disgusting; my body continues to surprise me. 

My blisters have been getting more troublesome and painful lately. I didn’t even know that it could be possible but I was wrong and it was. They didn’t even look like proper blisters anymore, they resembled pustules; dark red and yellow in colour. They covered my hands, my face, my torso and legs. Nothing I did got rid of them. One sleepless night, I saw something inside them move. A shadow. 

One morning I woke up to find I was covered in gaping holes; my sheets were soaked in pus and blood. Amongst the infected opaque liquid, I saw little footprints. *Hundreds* of little footprints. Then I heard those little feet scurry to and fro. With my heart in my mouth, I turned my eyes to the floor. What I saw there made me vomit. 

My blisters stood on the floor, all facing me in a circle. Warped feet and little hands protruded from within their rounded bodies; or boils. In the middle of that circle lay various bloody organs; a spleen, a kidney and a liver. My eyes widened in horror as I realised who they belonged to. 

At that moment, I felt a blinding pain in the back of my head - a searing, burning sensation. As if someone was splitting me open from the inside. Blood splattered across my face and the walls that surrounded me. Before I faded, I saw a large, deformed boil; adorned by yellow and crimson fluid. Behind it, it dragged something the size of a large grapefruit. 

It was my brain."

I never liked my boss. He was a jerk. He treated me like trash, and for years I meekly took it. So, yes, I had every reason to hate him, but all I wanted was to order a confetti bomb.

Because I'd never done anything like that, I chose a website at random. The process was simple. Give my email, select an address and choose a confetti level: low, medium, high, or *beautiful pink*.

I chose the last.

Three days later, I received a video in my inbox.

Blackness with sound:

...a doorbell, my boss' voice asking if he needed to sign, faint shuffling, a loud thud. Next I heard a utility knife cutting cardboard—

**A deafening bang!**

Darkness faded to colours and sunlight:

A rain of confetti.

My boss' facial expression, but not surprise—horror!

Feebly he lifted the utility knife and pointed it at the camera *as the camera moved toward him.*

Then music began, as if from a music box, one melody, caught in an endless loop, over which a raspy voice sang in whispers:

*… lovely pink confetti …*

""Please, there's been a mistake,"" my boss pleaded.

The camera approached.

A shadow fell upon the floor. A black, inhuman shadow. Umbra without penumbra. Crawling forward. Crawling *onto*...

My boss' fear loomed ever greater, magnified with every passing second, until each facial crease seemed etched permanently into his skin. Pale and unmoving, he was a grotesque statue of himself.

""Please,"" he whimpered.

""Sing.""

*… lovely pink confetti …*

He sliced at the camera with the utility knife—

A clawed hand caught his wrist.

""Sing.""

""Lovely… pink confetti,"" he sang in a heartbeat staccato. ""Lovely pink confe—""

The claws tightened, his wrist bled; he gasped!

The utility knife dropped.

A second set of claws swiped across the screen, opening four parallel wounds on his chest. Four red lines bleeding sickeningly downward.

He sobbed.

The shadow had climbed to his neck.

His choked, animal sounds were adding a perverse rhythm to the music.

*… lovely pink confetti …*

The shadow enveloped him.

The claws carved.

His screams—

The video ended abruptly, leaving me stunned.

Two months later, there was a knock on my door, and I looked outside to see a cardboard box. I hauled it in.

*Hesitation.*

But curiosity got the better of me, and when I opened—

**A deafening bang!**

Followed by a shower of beautiful pink confetti.

*Fleshy, bloody strips of confetti.*

Raining down upon my body and upon the entirety of my home.

*Confetti sliding down the window panes.*

*Confetti clogging up the drains.*

*Confetti gathering in sloppy puddles on the floor.*

*Confetti made of gore.*

It took days to clean up, and there's likely still confetti in the deepest cracks and corners, but there was something else in the box: a message thanking me for my purchase of the *soul-shredding* service and offering three codes for future soul-shreddings—at 33.4% off the regular price."

I grin because I still find their reactions funny.

I am always afraid of looking at it because it always looks like I am going to fall in there, maybe I can visit my father there or wherever he is.

She tossed and turned and was up again in two minutes. To the liquor cabinet. Relief flooded over her; the mere thought of the alcohol soothed her. She picked up the bottle of vodka, half gone already, and took a long drink. The bitter taste didn’t faze her anymore. 

She paced around and waited for it to kick in. The anxiety meds first, and she went to lay down again. This time she pulled the cover over her head and breathed in the warm air of her own breath. The soothing downer. Now the alcohol took hold; warm and fuzzy. She closed her eyes and tried to remember him. Even to call to him. 

Friends had told her it was sleep paralysis and nothing more. That’s how she got the prescription for the anxiety drugs in the first place. Waking up each night in a panic, unable to move and convinced someone was there. Her days were wrecked and she hated the thought of going to sleep. 

It was more than sleep paralysis, of that much she was sure. 

She closed her eyes now and let her body sink into the sofa, not sleeping, but calling out to him. It came over her in waves of gray and brown. He was getting stronger as of late. 

He’d starting coming to her at odd times, she didn’t have to be paralyzed anymore for it to happen. He was always dark. Something not quite material but not illusory either. 

He told her things, but not with words. She couldn’t trust anyone. Only him. She’d do whatever it took to embrace him completely. 

The more she let herself go the stronger he grew. 

Ahhh, he was there. And the alcohol was causing her skin to pulse. 

He was becoming her. Growing stronger as she grew weak and addicted. And all the while she thought there had to be some meaning. 

But there was no meaning. 

It was downright parasitic. The less she was, the more he was.

When I start to smell because of not showering for days that definitely tells me that time is moving forward. Recently I have done something a bit too extreme. I just can't help myself you see, as the terror of thinking I am stuck re-living the same day horrifies me.

He killed himself. I admit that my reaction was somewhat a little too much, but I genuinely panicked. The baseball bat was there next to the door. I grabbed it. And I swung it. Then I ran and hid in a linen closet. And here I am, waiting. Another drop on blood lands on my hand, desperately demanding my attention. Why is this so important? I push the thought to the back of my mind again. Not now. There have been no sounds for a while now. I open the door of the closet, trying to hear anything. The silence spreading through the house is almost deafening. Slowly, with the bat in attack position, I make my way to the front door. And there it dawned on me why the blood was so important.

Never bothered to ask Mom or Dad why, considering they told me the first day we moved in to never touch that door. Only peek to the other side is through the keyhole, but all that welcomes me is a pitch black, if anything this seems like a door to nowhere.

January 1st I decided I was gonna see what was behind that damn door, we lived here 3 years now and  I must know before I go off to college two states over. Call me a jackass, but I spiked my Mom and Dad's tea with a sleeping aid. Had to do this as they sleep one room over to the door, and I can't afford being caught, I might never see the end of their wrath.

January 2nd came, Mom and Dad looked like someone knocked them out in a boxing ring. I heard the \*click\* as the door unlocked itself. A buzzing sound met me as my hand grasp the rusty knob. With a twist and pull I am met with... utterly nothing.

That was until I turned my flashlight on, I shrieked. What I saw is forever burned into my memory: eyes, lips, noses, ears, arms, legs. Multiple human body parts were strewn all over a small closet sized space. They sat in jars of different sizes with dates written on the jars.

January 2, 1843

January 2, 1924

January 2, 1971

The list goes on and on, dates from multiple centuries starting in 1802.

Now I know what you’re thinking, this is gonna be one of those stories where a monster skulks in the dark and kills me or makes me evil or something like that, but don’t you worry there’s nothing scary about my monster. My monster doesn’t hide in the dark. My monster doesn’t rip flesh and drink blood. My monster comforts me when I’m bullied. My monster cries when I cry and laughs when I laugh. My monster keeps me from being scared when my dad gets mad. My monster protects me when my mom gets drunk. “It’s ok,” it’ll say. I’m here to protect you. 

Now my brother has a monster under his bed too, and it’s a little different. His monster has shadows that creep even when it doesn’t move. His monster makes him cry and keeps him up at night. His monster is the reason he’s never hiding in his room when our dad gets mad and our mom gets drunk.

I’ve tried to help him out, but now he’s scared of my monster too. I know there’s something wrong  with his monster. I’ve seen the blood stains on my brother’s sheets and the bruises on my brother’s hands. I’m determined to save my poor brother from his monster. 

————————————————————————————————————————————

I walked toward my brother’s room, knife in hand and mind made up. I stopped, waiting for a sound to indicate the room was empty. Silence. Wait no! Was that... a whimper I just heard? Was that my brother crying out in pain? I burst into the room, ready to defend my brother from whatever horrible things his monster was doing to him.

The door crashed open to reveal the most horrific scene I’d ever seen. Blood covered the walls, the window was broken, a severed finger hung from the fan, all of which were framing the two figures that were at the foot of the bed. One was a twisted and contorted body, barely recognizable, broken glass sticking out of his skin in countless places. Standing over the body was the horrible, dark, looming figure of... my brother. 

He let out a cackling laugh as he kicked the monster’s body across the room.

“Bu-but...” I muttered, horrified at what he’s done, “I saw the blood, and the bruises... the bruises...”

“Oh, you always were naive,” he replied, stabbing once more as he spoke, “you really thought I was the one in danger? You’re so impossibly stupid.” 

“You... bastard!” I growled, trembling with rage. “How could you do this!”

He turned away from me to kick his monster again, and without thinking I lunged at him with the knife. As I drove the knife into his chest he looked back up at me and said his final words, “I... never did like cowards...” The light faded from his eyes and I fell to my knees, crying."

No one tries to stop me as I walk towards the main studio, faceless officers talk indistinctly in doorways. 

My jacket is wet from falling rain, I feel the dampness on my hands as I hug myself. My footsteps echo loudly around me, louder than the voices. In the main studio, I see two of the faceless officers bent over a small figure. As I approach, they move out of the way, and I see her. Her legs have decayed, the bones there are broken, jutting out weirdly. Her wrists have been bound, her hands have rotted as well. *Most of her is in really good condition.* That last thought wasn't mine.

Somehow information about her floods my head. She is a missing person. She was last seen with the ballet teacher, alone. Parents at a recent recital mentioned hearing scratching behind the wall, as well as hearing whimpering and smelling rot.

The ballet teacher has had charges raised on multiple occasions for malpractice, breaking dancers' legs in order to make them more flexible. 

She has never been found guilty.

I rake my eyes up the small girl's body, a lump rising in my throat. I see her mouth, all the flesh there has been torn away. When my eyes meet hers, she looks over at me and whimpers, and that's when I wake up.

With all of these new DNA Geneology tests now readily available, I thought it’d be fun to surprise my parents by getting a better picture as to our ancestry.  I secretly purchased a test kit and sent it in. 

Some 6 weeks later, my heart jumped when I saw the notification saying results were ready to view.  I eagerly opened the chart, hoping this would bring insight and clarity.

When I opened the results, however, I found only confusion.  There wasn’t any Russian listed at all.  I showed 62% Scottish, 11% Welsh, 10% German, 8% Italian, 5% Arabic, and 4% Indigenous American.  I figured if there was one person who might be able to explain this one, it would be my father.  

My father was rarely a person to be quick to anger, but when I showed him the results he lost his mind.  He yelled at me worse than any other time in recent memory, shouting expletives about fraudulence and incompetence.  He demanded that I delete the results and never speak of it again.

I had never felt so let down, but I deleted it and tried to forget.  That only lasted for two days, however, as this morning I received the call that would change everything. 

“Is this Max Antonov?”  Asked the caller.

“Umm, yeah, who’s this?”  I replied, with uncertainty.  

“This is detective Reynolds.  I need to have a word with you, privately.”

I was concerned, but my parents weren’t home so I hopped on my bike and pedaled to the station.  The officers were kind, too kind, I could tell something was off.

“We need to talk to you about your DNA test,” said detective Reynolds, “Your profile matches a murder victim in a cold case.  I really don’t know how to tell you this, but that victim could be your mother.”  

“That’s not possible,” I assured him, “my mother is alive and well.”  

“Max, the Victim was found murdered and her 3-week old baby was missing and never found. The crime happened on January 6th, 2003, which is the date you listed as your birthday.  Look, I know this is a lot, but we’d like to take your fingerprints so we can compare them to the finger prints on the birth certificate of the missing baby.”  

All I could do was nod.  

Hours passed as I waited for results.  They said they were rushing, but it felt like days.  Finally, Reynolds came into the room.  He put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a pitiful look. 

“Son, I’m sorry to say it’s a match.”"

He took off his coat and closed tightly the door.

Then kicked off his shoes and socks to the floor.

&#x200B;

Stepping between cans and bottles of booze,

The man gave a groan and said ""time for a snooze"".

&#x200B;

Undressing some more he sat on his bed.

Soon he laid down and rested his head.

&#x200B;

But then came a noise, quiet at first.

Then louder and louder, it kept getting worse.

Not totally sure if he was alone.

&#x200B;

His door was ajar and the thought then arose.

""I'm sure before now my door there was closed"".

&#x200B;

He went to the door for the second time that night.

This time making sure it was shut extra tight.

Came a low stammered breathing and another sharp chill.

&#x200B;

Was a raspy breath like an old dying mutt.

""The wind!"" The man said ""the wind and no more!"".

""The wind is the one who stands at my door!"".

&#x200B;

As he tried his best to forget and ignore.

The man kept repeating ""the winds at my door"".

&#x200B;

But it couldn't be shook, the thought wouldn't leave.

That wind isn't usually able to breathe.

&#x200B;

""An open window!"" he tought ""Causing a breeze!"".

This was the solution that left him quite pleased.

&#x200B;

""I'm sure that's it! Pah ghost!"" He mocked.

So he checked the window but found it was locked.

&#x200B;

""Then it must be-"" started the man,

His words then cut short, when at the door came a slam.

""I'll pay it, it's yours! I beg leave me be!"".

&#x200B;

Then came a voice, it creaked and it moaned.

""But why would I go and leave you alone?"".

&#x200B;

""Please"" the man begged ""what do you need?"".

The deep voice returned ""I want you to bleed"".

&#x200B;

""Why!"" The man sobbed ""what business have you here"".

The door then crept open and it all became clear.

&#x200B;

In the doorway propped up, a corps that was mangled.

A boy with one arm, his guts out and tangled.

&#x200B;

His skin was ash grey and covered in mud.

Once hastily buried still hemorrhaging blood.

&#x200B;

""You're dead!"" Screamed the man ""t'was an accident too!"".

The ghost wasn't pleased ""the blame is on you"".

&#x200B;

""You were drunk that night, been drinking all day"".

""So why was my life the one taken away!"".

&#x200B;

""I'm sorry"" the man sobbed ""it wasn't on purpose"".

""I'm sorry I'm sorry, you do not deserve this!"".

&#x200B;

The spirit still angry produced a sharp knife.

""To put me at peace, you shall take your own life"".

&#x200B;

The man's face was pale because he now knew.

For this suffering to end, he must be dead too.

&#x200B;

He picked up the handle and pointed the blade.

Then put it to neck and made his skin flayed.

It was over in seconds, blood pooled on the floor.

Light faded from his eyes and the man was no more.

&#x200B;

Weeks passed before the man's body was found.

His blood, mixed with booze, had stuck to the ground.

&#x200B;

Police check the tapes of the security cam.

And saw stood alone the crazed drunken man.

&#x200B;

Out of his mind, and armed with a knife.

Stricken with guilt he took his own life.

&#x200B;

A cold case now answered, at rest they both are.

A mad alcoholic and the victim of his car."

I turned on the bedside lamp, breathing heavily.

My husband shuffled under the duvet and turned to face me. His eyes were bloodshot as if he were crying.

""Elly..."" Chris said slowly, wrapping his arms around me. ""I had a nightmare, too.""

I stared at him. ""How did you know I had a nightmare?""

He blinked. ""Well, you were thrashing around like a crazed animal screaming.""

I stared at his red eyes. ""Have you been crying?""

He shifted uncomfortably at my question.

""No,"" he said finally, ""I'm just a bit shaken up.""

""I don't want to go back to sleep,"" I said, sitting still.

""Why?"" Chris chuckled, ""Was your nightmare that bad? What did you dream about?""

I inched closer to him. ""Well. Me and you were in the living room, watching TV. And then, all of a sudden, you open your mouth really, really wide and start screaming. I got scared and told you to stop, but you didn't.""

Chris said nothing, just stared at me.

""Then, I got up to leave, but you sat me down on the couch. Then you turned the TV off, and stared at me, screaming. I started crying and told you to please stop. I was really scared.""

Chris's eyes narrowed. He looked at me nervously.

""But you didn't stop. You kept screaming and your mouth got even bigger and bigger. Then, when I tried to move, I couldn't. It was like I was superglued to the couch. Then you started moving closer to me. Screaming. I yelled and cried for help, but nobody came.""

Chris placed his arm on my shoulder. ""Elly..."" he whispered.

""Hm?"" I looked at him. He looked as if he'd seen a ghost.

""*I had the exact same dream.*"" he said, and opened his mouth, screaming."

He moved with a conservative gait through the crowd, not a step misplaced, his skin a dirty patchy yellow, millions of tiny blue veins pulsating up and down the exposed forearms. The man ignored the audience as he evaluated the escalating situation.

4 uniformed guards were struggling to restrain Prisoner 1106, sweat and tears from the damned dripping onto the worn leather straps of the splintery chair. The ancient prisoner was dressed in the rare maroon jumpsuit, his wrinkled eyes bulging, unseeing as he snarled and coughed and gnashed like a cornered dog. Dark stains were growing on 1106’s maroon pants. A guard suddenly screamed and fell over, clutching his bleeding hand as the elderly man chewed up the stolen piece of flesh.

With a polite smile, Purple Tie strode quickly to the prisoner, replacing the fallen guard. A firm grasp on the 1106’s wrist and a snap, and the prisoner’s right hand was now useless. The guards finally managed to strap the man down, and they pulled back quickly, huffing loudly from exhaustion. Purple Tie smiled at 1106, a friendly smile that did not match his hateful tone.

“Prisoner 1106, formerly known as Thomas Blake, you have been charged with the crime of murder in the 3rd degree and arson, responsible for the deaths of 26 civilians in your apartment complex. Your new sentence is 100 years. Will you give a statement at this time?”

The old man in the wooden chair had grown silent, a small pathetic shell of a human. The anger and terror from his dull eyes had faded, now replaced with a look of pleading. 1106 stared directly at Purple Tie, tears dripping from the ancient face. A single dry whisper echoed from the prisoner.

“Pleeease.... No… more. So…. Tired…”

The audience glared. A single cough, then silence. 

Purple Tie’s smile grew wider. His hands moved to 1106’s forehead, resting gently. 1106 continued to stare at his executioner, his teary eyes closing in desperation and denial of what was to come. Purple Tie’s forearms clenched, the veins pulsating.

The sound of water flowing through a clogged drain.

1106’s skin stretched tight, sparse hair began to darken and thicken, the spindly frame now became square, shorter, stockier. A heartbeat, once erratic, began to strengthen.

Getting younger again.

As Purple Tie removed his hands from the teenager’s head, his voice echoed through the silent audience.

“That was number 10. Only 16 more sentences to go.”"

I was still sleeping so it took a bit to move. She threw me into the basement and grabbed dad's belt. 

Mum's been doing this for almost two weeks now, with no signs of stopping. I've grown to get used to the scars. But not to the belt. Every night, she does this. I haven't seen dad a lot around the house either. He hasn't texted me once. 

I'm starting to think that he doesn't care for me. I never want to leave my room unless it's for the bathroom or meals. The whole house is quiet. Bottles and trash are all over the place. Dad's passing has been really affecting her.

Yesterday she took me to the basement again. I can never get used to how she grabs my hair and drags me. But something was different. She took knife from behind her back and lunged at me.

For my safety, I ran upstairs and into the living room before she grabbed me again. I grabbed a nearby bottle and smashed it against her head. I hid inside of my room, desperately looking for a weapon to defend myself with. 

She started banging on the door, Twisting the door handle so hard I thought it might fall off. I heard some footsteps going away, so I thought she left. I grabbed the extension chord and waited for her to come in.

As expected, she opened the door at full force. The locks must've broken. Then I lunged at her from behind and choked her. She attempted to grab me, but failed. She stumbled backwards, making both of us fall down the stairs.

When I woke up, there was blood across the floor. She had hit her head on one of the tables. I had some blood dripping as well, but I was very much alive.

I slowly stood up, grabbed my phone, and walked out of the house. Not even bothering to close the door behind me. I turn around, and look at mum. 

""I hate you, mum."" I mumbled, and walked away."
kayjfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kayjfm/i_long_for_insanity/,I long for insanity.,17,2,1607673318.0,"My New Years' Resolution is to give in to insanity.

I know, I know- odd fucking resolution, Eric, why would you want to be insane? Even if I plead and plead, nobody understands. Nobody understands how much I crave blood, long for murder, strive to go clinically insane.

I've watched all these movies: The Shining, Repulsion, Antichrist. It's beautiful, how someone so disgusting can slowly evolve into someone I admire. Someone who gives into the temptations, rather than suppress them day and night. I mean, we all have those thoughts- ""I wish I could fucking slit my mother's throat,"" ""I'd love to see the little black puppy get murdered by my dad's truck."" Don't try to deny it- I know you've thought those things.

Everyone looks down on insanity. They lock you in a fucking prison, expect you to follow a schedule every day, and take away any right to expression. They expect you to coexist, to get along with others. To not slit each others' fucking throats.

My mother tried to put me in one of those before. They called it a ""mental hospital,"" and told me where I was supposed to sleep. I was to spend every day there, for the rest of my life; my family didn't want me any more. The only way I'd ever regain freedom was if I followed their conduct for three years, 1,096 fucking days.

When they released me, they gave me little white capsules. They told me to take one every day, and I'd never have to go back. You see, that's how they get you: they give you freedom, but trick your brain into following their relentless cycle all day when the capsule enters your mouth. I read the labels, and looked them up. What they're used for. It's mind control.

I never took them. I always put it in my mouth, then when my mother is looking away, spit it into my palm. Sometimes I feed it to the birds, but they die too quickly when it's mixed in their feeder. I slip crushed tablets into the sugar bowl occasionally- it always gives me a good chuckle when someone vomits out their morning cereal.

I've become more and more upset over who I am. I'm living a lie, and I desperately want to change. Occasionally, I'll sneak into my mother's room, placing my hand right over her throat, mimicking what I long to do. Embrace insanity.

I watch from my window as people walk up and down the streets, imagining the rush of adrenaline that would course through my veins as I steal their lives, one after another, after another.

Embrace insanity.

Isolate myself from the world, in a small cottage in the woods, never to be found until I'm ready. Embrace insanity. Kill again. And again. Slower, and slower, as I master my craft. Embrace insanity. Lead the police on a chase as the clues get harder and harder to decipher.

Embrace insanity. Live insanity. Be....me."
kax48x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kax48x/kenny/,KENNY,32,4,1607666662.0,"I grew up an only child with only one friend. His name was Kenny.My parents thought it was odd for me to hang around with a boy so much when there were tons of other girls in the neighborhood. It's not like we didn't try to make friends with the girls in my block but when I introduced them to Kenny they'd give me these weird looks.Eventually I just gave up.

When I started second grade,I noticed that something was wrong with Kenny. He was getting thinner and his hair looked faded.Not like it was greying or anything,it just looked dull and lifeless. Like his eyes.Kenny had always had dark eyes but now they just seemed grey,they were still dark they just seemed grey.

One morning I came downstairs to find Kenny waiting for me like he usually did.But he was different. He looked taller,skinnier and even meaner somehow.I was scared to ask him what was wrong. Even as we walked to school.

He even walked different.Stooped with a slight limp.At this point I thought maybe he was bieng abused, then I realized I had never been to Kenny's house. And I'd never heard him mention his parents.

After school Kenny convinced me to take a shortcut home.it was a path through the forest behind the school.I was reluctant but he was my best friend. I trusted him.

When we seemed to be getting farther from civilization and not closer I asked Kenny why it was taking so long.He looked at me and the look in his eyes made my heart stop.His now blood red eyes were pools of hate and malice.

I backed up but his hand?no his claws grabbed at me.He caught me by the hair and dragged me on the forest floor. I kicked and screamed until he let me go.I scrambled to my feet and I realized we were in a clearing. Surrounded by other creatures that looked like Kenny.Tall,impossibly skinny and with mean red eyes

They gathered around me and started poking and prodding me with their clawed fingers.

I was shaking in fear.I also felt angry and betrayed.He was my best friend! How could he!?

I braced my self and kicked the closest one with all my strength. I heard a crack and the creature howled and toppled over,dragging two of its mates with it.I ran through the gap I had created and sped blindly through the trees.

I could hear them coming after me but they weren't as fast as I thought they would be.I ran until I could see a road ahead of me.I heard their howls still incessantly chasing after me.I ran onto the road and raced down the tarmac until I realized they had stopped at the edge of the forest.But I didn't stop.

When I finally reached home I found my parents in a state of panic. They asked me where I had been and I told them Kenny had tried to kill me.They glanced at each other then my dad asked me if I meant Kenny as in my imaginary friend.That's when it hit me that only my parents and my teachers acknowledged Kenny's presence. They were playing along. And that's why all the other kids thought I was weird!Kenny had been invisible to everyone but me!

That night I dreamt about him.We were back in the clearing,but this time he was himself, only with the red eyes of the creature inside him,he was smiling.no.more like smirking .Then he spoke.And his words scared me out of my nightmare. He said : ""We'll be back for you"""

Their pleading eyes are round, whites circling the sliver of iris around dilated pupils.

Their sweat beads and trickles, merging with their tears, coating their ashen cheeks.

Their lips tremble over dry teeth, white froth coating corners, breath hot and bitter.

My blade travels sternum to navel, crimson rivulets branching between the gooseflesh covering their supple skin.

Their breathes wheeze and spasm between screams that call out to imaginary saviors.

My fingers plunge within and curl around my target.

Their heart writhes against my palm as their body writhes beneath me.

I squeeze.

Their bloodshot eyes stare as static pleas linger on lifeless lips.

He looks back with a nervous smile full of excitement. “See ya when I see ya babe,” without a second thought he faces forward and jumps.

Enjoying the rest of his fall and heading back to base he has a feeling that something ain’t right but he shakes it off to anxiety and adrenaline.

Worriedly he waits till about 2 hours have past with still no plane, and calls 911. An investigation was launched to quickly run cold. His girl, the plane and those two pilots were never seen again."
kaukhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kaukhe/the_wow_planet/,The Wow! Planet,167,3,1607656756.0,"August 15, 1977, Ohio State University received a signal from the Sagittarius constellation. Unknown in origin, but believed by some people to be a sign of extraterrestrial life. 


Nobody knows that we sent a crew out there in 1985.


There are 32 stars with planets within the constellation, and the closer they got the easier it was to narrow down possible origins. The ship landed on an exoplanet, dubbing it the “Wow planet”. 


The crew found the signal originated from the core of that planet.


One of the crewmen, Simon, went insane. He claimed to hear a song calling for him, singing sweet rhythms into his ears. The crew eventually had to tie him down after he had attacked some of them, resulting in one casualty. 


Seeing Simon was past help, the crew finally agreed to let him go to the crater, as long as he took a video camera with him and transmitted the signal back to them. He agreed, practically panting. 


Simon ran as fast as the stronger gravity would allow, diving into the crater as if he wouldn’t get hurt from the fall. The crew watched the live transmission, assuming Simon would simply fall and die. 


He landed deep underground, screaming about how he can hear the planet sing. He crawled through caves and tunnels, which were full of a strange, viscous slime. 


Finally, he reached a large cistern, and back in their ship, the crew began to shudder. 


In the center of the cistern was a large, glowing void. It was hard to look at, even through a video camera, as if it couldn’t decide what shape it was. All around it were unknown, alien creatures. Some were biped, others had many colored scales, a few had multiple heads, and one was even made of vines. All of the aliens were emitting a sound similar to the Wow signal, and Simon began to sing along with it, matching the frequency exactly. 


The void in the center grew in size, and for a moment the crew thought they saw Simon's face inside of it, screaming alongside the other alien creatures. 


The camera dropped to the ground, before it cut out, Simon looked right at it, grinning maniacally and singing the Wow frequency, and began to cry. 


The crew returned home, and sworn to secrecy, tried to return to a normal life in NASA, studying other signals, putting aside both the weird creature and the confirmation of extraterrestrial life. 


Yesterday I was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I don’t have very long left, even less time since I'm skipping treatment. 


The very last thing I want to do is tell the truth.


I was one of the researchers who reviewed the footage.


Every night when I close my eyes, I see aliens singing. I hear the Wow frequency inside my head. I see Simon, screaming and singing at the same time. 


We aren’t alone in the universe. 


But I don’t think we’ll be investigating any more space signals. "

I think I'm in a... cave? I don't know, I can barely see the end of my nose!

The ground reeks, a filthy mix of god-knows what, but still containing a pungent sweetness that's overpowering my nostrils. Too sweet, it's too sweet.

The walls are some jelly like substance. I think I can leave a handprint in it, but I'm not sure, I can't see if I leave a mark properly.

I've felt around for what feels like ages, but there's no entrance that I can see, except for a tiny hole in the top, but I can't exactly wiggle out using that.

Only one thing for it. The walls seem pretty soft.

I started to dig, clawing out the stuff as it stuck underneath my fingernails, feeling a wet liquid along with it. It bent to my will like putty. No, seriously. That's what it felt like. Putty. Soft and malleable under my nails.

I kept going, carving out an entrance like some off-brand form of The Great Escape, desperately trying to seek some opening, some light at the end of the tunnel...

Until I broke through.

Ripping through the red fabric, I sheathed my claws and peeked up through the hole.

Shocked faces, all staring at me. A young boy, an irate father, a distressed mother.

I looked down. No wonder it took so long to get through. Those dimples and rosy cheeks that shone so merrily now a deathly white, as blood drained from his face and out through his red suit, drenching me.

I looked up again at the faces, as panic and terror started to set in once the realization that Santa had just been murdered by some demonic Christmas thing in their house had fully hit them.

Might as well play the part.

I unsheathed my talons and hissed, but before I scuttled back up the chimney I had one thing to say...

“Okay, go on ahead,” said the toll-collector. There was no front door, but we were still trying to get inside. A veranda wrapped around and spiraled up the house. Almost everyone in our town had paid at least the first toll, and now it was my turn to continue down the veranda.

“Come on, dude,” said my fiancé. This wasn’t the only time that his lips had gotten me into trouble.

As we walked to the first vision, our bandages almost glowed with bloodstains. He pointed to the moon with his shortened digit, pulled the bandage off, and said, “E.T. bone home.” I laughed. His vision was first. He told me that he had seen himself seated at a table before a platter stacked high with steamed crabs. He wore a golden prosthetic on his index finger that he raised in a kingly gesture over a crab and let it fall to crack the shell under the weight of the metal. “That’s gonna be me, dude!”

I looked next. I had a golden prosthetic, too, but it was long. I managed to maneuver the rod into my mouth and then pushed it down my throat like a sword-swallower. I vomited jagged little shards of crab shell. I told him that I had had the same vision.

We went up a flight of stairs and came to the second toll-collector, the funman. He wanted to ride us. My fiancé got down on his hands and knees, and the toll-collector jumped over the desk and onto his back. He crawled on all fours as fast as he could, occasionally rearing up on his knees like a horse rampant on the coat of arms of a better family than mine. When his mount’s dignity was almost exhausted, he spurred him over the stairs. The funman walked back up the stairs, and my fiancé followed crawling. “My girlfriend’s pregnant,” he told the funman. Before he left me to continue, he said, “We’re gonna be such good parents when I’m done.”

I walked back. There was no vision in the window. I only saw bones, gold and dust. I waited for my fiancé by the fingerman so I wasn’t alone. “If you still have half a heart,” he said, “you’ll give that thing a chance at life and put it up for adoption.” Hours later, the sun rose. As I walked away wondering how to explain this to his parents, the fingerman said, “Come back when you have nowhere else to go.”

I did come back. I had had many years to think about it, but I didn’t know what toll I wanted to collect until my first time. They were a cute couple, and the way that the boy talked her into it almost made me swoon. “Give me your lips,” I said."

“You are hot, I am going to give you some medicine” 

When she comes, I ask something that every kid worries about.

“Mom am I going to die??” 

“Aww sweetie you aren’t going to die, you are just feeling yucky, and truth me people feel yucky all the time, and how about this after you are feeling well me and you get some ice cream” 

Those were the good time when I get sick and my mom always makes me feel better even I could get up and seeing her warm smiles makes it me better all the time, but sadly that was my first time getting a fever so I felt awful.

And then I went to sleep.. well at least I thought I did
because I kept on waking up to loud noise and screaming, but since I am too tired to care what is going on I just went back to sleep.

Then I when woke up again I wasn’t in the cozy bed. I was in a van with 5 other kids that were around my age, And right before I went back to sleep again I heard a deep voice.

“One of them is awake”

And even though this is my first time getting a fever I heard of fever dreams and thought this was a nightmare, but if it was a nightmare then the scars on my body wouldn’t hurt so much right? 
 
And nowadays I am locked up in a cage, while they inject me with poison.

I was like a lab monkey to them, but not the good one the one where they cut you when you don’t follow the rules and set your confidence down, and you can’t do anything 
because We were just kids.

And still today I hope that all of this is a fever dream. One big fever dream. Oh, you can’t imagine how that would feel cause I can’t.

But at least I am making new friends or at least that's what they told me.

The dudes with pins and needles tell me lots of things that no kid should know about.

Especially when they tell you that your mommy is dead.

And it started with a fever, but honestly, I have seen worst, Like stuff you only see in the bad fever dreams"

I willed my heavy eyelids to open and focus: a middle-aged man and his daughter scanned the rows of cheap frozen fast food and expired hotdogs. The father whispered something to his daughter, opted to pace in front of the coffee machine as she walked up to me.

I think I said something to the effect of ""Hello what can I get you"" but my words came out as a mumbled yawn.

""Small Americano, no sugar."" She ordered briskly, voice carrying a tinge of urgency.

Again, my brain went on auto-pilot and I asked for her name . There really is no point considering she's the only customer, but I've had the question drilled into my head since day one.

""Sally Ogden Sanderson."" She repeated, ""My name is Sally Ogden Sanderson.""

""Alright."" I grabbed a cup and scribbled ""Sally"" on it.

""No,"" She leaned forward onto the counter, staring at me intently, ""Sally Ogden Sanderson.""

I was confused, ""Yeah? I got that.""

""No, not Sally."" She insisted, I found her voice grating my tired ears, ""Sally Ogden Sanderson.""

Too sleepy to explain that I don't have the patience for any bullshit, I showed her the cup with ""Sally"" written on it.

""No, you don't get it."" She was starting to sound like a broken record, ""I'm Sally Ogden Sanderson, don't you know who I am?""

But I just wanted to get the job over with, so I went to scribble on ""- Ogden Sanderson"" on the cup. My brains short circuited from sleep deprivation and it ended up being an unintelligible scrawl across the cup. I sighed and threw away the cup, ready to start over.

Sally Ogden Sanderson frowned impatiently, grabbed another cup, and proceeded to write her name down. Just as she finished the last few letters, the older man called out to her.

""Honey? We need to get going.""

""But the coffee-""

""We still have some left in the backseat.""

Sally tossed the cup at me and turned to leave. I held it, dumbfounded at the whole exchange, and watched the pair drive away in their car.

I looked down at the cup in my hands, and what was written on it drove all my sleep away.

**S***ally* ***O****gden* ***S****anderson.*

During my late night studies, I fell asleep. I awoke at around 6 or 7, because that’s how it’s always been no matter how tired I was. 

Anyways so I lazily walk out of my room half-asleep and into the bathroom. I was in the middle of brushing my teeth struggling to stay awake, until I heard light tapping noises. I stop for a couple of seconds to make sure I heard right. I heard the tapping sounds again, and I pinpointed them to my window, that was just above the toilet. Being curious I lifted the blinds up, to be met with stern blue eyes. He seemed to be standing outside the window, glancing around until finally meeting my eyes.

Since I was still half-asleep I opened the window a little. “Hi?” I lazily said, as he gave me some confused looks before shaking his head and sighing.
 
“Can I come in? It’s quite urgent.” He asked quite quickly, I was known in the neighborhood to be quite chill. Plus my parents weren’t home so I just nodded, and gave him a thumbs up.

“Just meet me at the front door.” I stated, but he shook his head rapidly. I tilted my head.

“Can’t I just come in through the window? I’m in a rush!” He whispered shouted. I sighed, and opened the window all the way as he climbed in.

He was silent, and I finished my routine. As I walked towards the kitchen he followed behind. That’s when it hit me.

My bathroom is upstairs."

He lived with his mom and dad in a big house with a lot of rooms to play hide and seek in. It was his favourite game. And he loved it when mom and dad played with him. Well dad was usually busy, but mom had time for him. She was always home. 

There was one room, though, that little Jackie didn't like. It was his own. When little Jackie became a big boy, dad said that he needed to sleep in his own room. Jackie knew he was a big boy, but he didn't want to be alone in a dark room. And the room had all this girly stuff. But dad said that it was time, and that he would get some new toys as soon as mom was ready. Little Jackie didn't quite understand. Adults were often weird.

Dad also said that big boys don't need bedtime stories anymore. That made little Jackie sad. Mom had told him the same story every night. It was a story with some funny words in it. Finnish words, mom said. Mom had relatives living in Finland. Little Jackie wanted to visit there someday.

Jackie was so happy when mom didn't agree with dad, and came to his room every night to tell the story. He listened to mom, with the biggest smile on his face, as he drifted off to sleep.

""Nukahda, nukahda, close your eyes

It's time to rest, it's always wise

Sleep the whole night, don't come out

Tomorrow we'll play, there's no doubt""

But one day, mom wasn't there to play with little Jackie. Dad said she had to go away for a while. Later Jackie saw him crying. He was holding a picture of a child Jackie didn't know. But he recognized her from the pictures in his room. ""Mom just needs some time to rest"", dad told little Jackie. That day they played hide and seek the whole day long.

Jackie ate his vegetables like a good boy, and went to bed. Dad wouldn't tell him a bedtime story, but he sat with him. Jackie didn't need a story. He just wished for dad not to feel sad anymore, and for mom to come back home.

Later that night, Jackie woke up. It was dark and he didn't like it, but he was now a big boy. There was no need to wake up dad.

When Jackie's eyes adjusted to the dark, he saw something in the corner of his room. A small creature, standing there, staring at him with flaming eyes. It was hairy and wet, blacker than night, and so frightening that Jackie felt his bladder give in. As Jackie screamed, the creature smiled at him with crooked little teeth, and slowly crawled its way to Jackie's bed.

It was that moment when little Jackie made the horrible realization that the bedtime story wasn't for him."
kandmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kandmw/facing_my_fears/,Facing My Fears,13,6,1607631990.0,"I’m scared of loss. Not like losing a phone or a wallet, but losing friends, family. There’s something so terrifying about losing someone you love. There are people that are irreplaceable. All the laughs, late night talks, secrets, gone. The people you lose will never be able to hear what you have to say, be there for you when you need them most, they’ll just be gone.

I talk to a therapist, i’ve done so for a couple of years now. I wouldn’t consider them a friend, they just sit there, provide useless “help” and pretend to care. If they cared they would present a solution to fill the void, rather then leave the pain to marinate within me, suppressing it with pills. 

One week i was really bad. Couldn’t sleep, eat etc. (at least more than usual). She asked me questions constantly but i started to stop being truthful. All the other problems i’ve confessed have been pushed aside. I’m sick of it. 

“Any fears keeping you up?” she asked

At first it felt like she knew what i was going through, but the more i thought about it, it was probably another question they were conditioned to ask. I lied and said i was scared of heights. This way i wouldn’t be prescribed with some bullshit solution to the whole thing.

“Are you up high when you close your eyes?”

She obviously asked this question to tackle my sleeping problems but the truth is, she was right. Whenever i shut my eyes, i sit above an empty abyss. An abyss that was once full of all the memories, all the laughs, arguments, all the little things that made people who they are, the things that mattered. I would just stare down, hoping to find some type of hope, but there was always nothing. That’s what i’m afraid of.

I’ve lost people before. Why do you think i go to therapy. That’s why i don’t want to experience it again.  Maybe it’s selfish, but i don’t want to lose anyone else. It makes me sick. I lose a part of myself every time. All the imperfections that make them perfect, forgotten.

“Have you tried facing your fears?” she asked.

Now, this question right here. I intend on doing what she suggests. One thing i haven’t mentioned is that i’m also scared of dying. Like i said, this may be selfish but i’d rather face my fears then experience anymore loss. I can’t handle that pain. Ending it all would be less painful than seeing another person i love slip away, their legacy with them. It’s damaging, i can’t take it.

So here i am, on top of my apartment, looking down into the abyss. Staring into nothing, ready to escape."

Every little thing they did...

I mean, why? I was supposed to love them, why would they do something like this?

My love wasn't enough?

I'am angry, but way more than that i'am dissapointed.

I thought this time things would have been different, i don't understand.

If only i knew things were going to be like this i wouldn't even talk to them. Wouldn't even waste my time.

I gave them everything, whatever they needed i would give it to them.

It is such a shame, i have tried so many times but no. Their curiosity was stronger, their vanity is so precious for them.

And their ego... always thinking with this stupid narcissim. Always thinking they are better than anyone, always doing everything for themselves regardless of the consequences. They will ignore pain and suffer just to get a little bit of satisfaction. Their happiness is based on ignorance thinking they know it all.

They think they were first? That they are alone here? That they are the choosen ones? 

Not anymore.

I'm tired of this, i did sacrifice so much for this but they don't seem to care. They simply can't be worried about something they don't even think is worth their time. If only they knew...

I guess this kind don't understand, humankind don't understand.

They simply don't learn, no matter how much i try, how much i put my effort in them. They are destined to failure.

I will leave this project tomorrow morning, leaving this place for good. Going back home.

My last gift is this planet they will share. In all my frustration, i just hope Eva survives. I never liked Adan."

She would use actual fur from real animals, in the best cases she would even use their actual claws and eyes to give a little more detail.

It was hard work to get those as the animals were agile and it was even harder to sew their dead skin perfectly.

Rupert never saw games as a waste of time, even though his mother always complained about the time he spent on the computer. He truly understood the nature of games and what it took to be the best of the best. 

He played multiple games, but Grand Theft Auto was his crown jewel. Even though he liked the racing and challenges, he was the best griefer online. He would pick one player, kill him and wait for him to respawn and kill him again. And he would do this until the player would leave the server. And he loved it. Not allowing the other player to attack back. Always being a step ahead, always prepared. 

That is his gaming world, however, the real world is much different. In the real world, there is Rodney. He is Rupert’s personal griefer or as people would call it, a bully. He has never found out the reason why and he has never stood up to him. But today his favorite game will lend him some inspiration. Today he will be prepared and will not give Rodney any window of opportunity. He walks to the school’s courtyard and looks for the familiar ginger hair of his bully. “Hey Rodney!” he calls up to him and aims the barrel of the gun to his head."

Mom tries to keep it together—to pretend everything is fine. She opens her laptop and works until it’s dark outside. When I come into the room, she’s scrolling through old photos of the three of us together.

At midnight I hear the jingle of keys. Mom stands at the top of the stairs as Dad stumbles into the house, singing at the top of his lungs. She asks him where he’s been. He shouts a rude word I’m not supposed to say.

They start arguing. Again. Dad staggers towards the living room. Mom screams, “Well you’re not sleeping in my bed tonight!”

Dad says, “fine,” then falls onto the couch and starts snoring.

I guess Mom still loves him because she takes off his boots and throws a blanket over him. That makes me happy. Maybe things will go back to normal soon. And then they won’t have to talk about the D-word again.

The next day Dad sleeps until lunchtime. He comes into the kitchen while Mom's working and pours himself a glass of water without saying a word. By bedtime, they haven’t even said hello to each other.

This goes on for a while. They eat at different times and sleep in separate rooms. The closest they come to talking is when Mom walks into the bathroom as Dad is walking out. They’re like strangers living under the same roof.

I’m afraid they’ll start talking about the D-word again soon.

Mom walks into the garage while Dad’s working on the car. She says my name and he rubs the scar on the side of his face.

He turns to walk away but Mom starts shouting. Dad storms into the bedroom and packs his things into a suitcase. Mom calls him a bunch of words I’m not supposed to say.

Now I’m crying. I don’t want Dad to go. I don’t want anyone to say the D-word.

I race downstairs and stand in front of the door.

Dad stops in the hall and looks back over his shoulder. He says, “You can’t keep living in the past. There's nothing we can do about it now—""

I step in front of him to keep him from leaving. 

""—he's dead.""

Dad walks right through me, then gets in his car and drives off.

Mom screams, “Don’t ever come back!”

I stand in the front yard until Dad turns a corner and disappears.

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours a glass of wine. Then she puts her head down on the table and cries. When I try to hug her, her breath steams up and she shivers.

I wish I could do something—anything—to let her know I’m here. To tell her that I love her. That I love Dad. And I don’t want to ever hear them say the D-word again."

That said, I got trapped inside by a blizzard yesterday until after dark. Running at night can be dangerous. Normally, I'd avoid it. However, last night, it was either that or miss my daily exercise. At the time, compromising with a walk felt like the right call. 
 
There’s an unlit duck pond behind my house. It’s sunken into the ground like a shallow quarry. A paved walking trail circles the upper rim. A dirt trail circles the pond. The lower trail is my favorite. Sometimes, I’ll walk it at night and look for ghosts. Last night, however, the path to the pond seemed slippery, so I walked the upper rim instead.

At first, nothing seemed off. Ducks quacked like always, only shrouded by darkness. Then, I heard something. Not a quack. It was strained, visceral, like an inhuman scream. And once I started paying attention, I noticed that most of the “quacking” sounded more like screaming. Squinting, I surveyed the pond, but it was too dark to see anything spare a few flickering shadows. Ever-curious, I activated my phone’s flashlight. 

Dim white light lit over a hundred ducks, all frozen to the pond. Manic, those with energy left thrashed, screamed, and desperately flapped their wings. Most, however, had succumbed to their collective fate. These corpses lied lifeless beside their doomed yet undaunted kin, shadows stippling the snow behind them. 

Horrified, I killed my flashlight and vaulted over the upper rim. I tried to slide down, but something caught my foot, sending me tumbling face first down the steep hill. Fortunately, no one was there to notice. The moment my body crashed against the lower trail, I pushed myself back up and started looking around for something that I could use to help the ducks. 

I found a big rock. 

In my imagination, the rock shattered the ice into a billion pieces, freeing the few ducks that remained. Rendered stupid by panic, I put all the force I could muster behind one herculean throw. 

It landed with a loud crunch. At first, I thought it was the ice breaking. But, then the screaming got louder. At that point, I knew what I’d done. Knowing and dreading the visual, I activated my flashlight.

Stark against the white snow, a giant red stain surrounded the base of rock. Under it, I saw pierced flesh, exposed bones, twitching feathers, and glowing eyes that were locked with mine.

At first, I wanted to scream. But, instead, I looked from side to side. I didn’t see a soul. 

Rather than scream, I flicked off my flashlight. Dark thoughts popped into my head. No one saw me kill the duck. No one saw me fall down the hill either. *I can just walk home.* 

So, I took one final look around, flipped up my hood, and crept home under the cover of darkness."

""Fucking great. They're out front. All because I wanted to see my kid. We're fucked"" He whispered the words loud enough for me to hear. Although I wasn't sure who he meant was out front. Maybe we were expecting a guest. Maybe it was mom. I still didn't know how dad convinced her into letting me come along with him but almost as soon as he walked in her room, she stopped freaking out and screaming at him. He must have had a great argument! She even let him grab his gun from the closet, although she didn't say goodbye to either of us.

A loud voice coming from outside interrupted my thoughts. 

*COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP; WE WILL NOT ASK TWICE.*

Whoever was talking so loud didn't sound happy. Dad must've noticed my reaction because he stepped away from window to comfort me. 

""Hey Bud, it's okay. You're safe here. I'm sorry I put you through this. It got out of control so fast. I'm sorry."" Tears had began to fall down his chapped cheeks. ""Do you want to go be with your mom?"" His question hung in the air for a second while I considered.

I grasp, both delicately and desperately, at the fleeting wisps of dreams. It turns out, though, that the world doesn’t much care for your desire to remain unsaddled with your waking grief.  Bleary eyed or not, it seeps back in from the corners of consciousness. 

I’d been dreaming of my wife: alive, vibrant, vibrating.  Captivating and colorful.  Her laugh, a melody of twinkling strings.  Her smile, more illuminating and knowing. Ethereal. Beautiful. Her lovers and would-be lovers, vying for a casual glance…and her, focused on me, crystalline eyes boring through to my core.  It is taxing to remember a time when I didn’t love her.

It’s been two weeks since she left me here, cold and alone. She said she wouldn’t but, in the end, our tether to this world is tenuous.  She was held here by a thread, absolute spider’s silk, for so much of her final months. I know she was in pain. She was tired, disease-ravaged.  Her smile had contorted into a macabre caricature; she wore a grimace, at best. There was no more sparkle, just a worn patina glimmering weakly and sickly through the cracks.  

Mostly, she looked tired. Worn.  Her weak body pushed past its very earthly limits: used, spent. She lasted, emaciated and frail, for a year longer than we expected.  Along with her body, her very self atrophied.

My sweet girl, quick to laugh and sharp with her remarks, had grown bitter.  In fact, the woman that I uttered a choked goodbye to may well have been an imposter, lying in repose in my wife’s form. Before she went, her laugh grew mocking, cutting, dark.  As her face sunk in and her body succumbed, she sought to drag me into the void alongside her.  I held my ground, washing her hair and sponge bathing her. Changing her linens. Treating her sores. Covering the mirrors to shield her from her own wasting. Gripping her hand as she bore down through the worst of it and, at the end, dabbing her tears.

Her once-beautiful face contorted, shifting into a death mask of agony and horror.  Her expression when she left has been burned into my mind’s eye: terrified, wretched, pleading.  For all of her anger and vitriol, it seems she was outmatched for spite in her final moments.
But in these sweet moments, as I linger between the respite of sleep and the reality of day, I can imagine her as she was. I reach out and stroke her face, as I have for years before. Warm, early morning sunlight streams through our blinds. I run my fingers through her hair.

Only this morning, her hair falls off into my hands in clumps.  If I’m honest, it really is getting difficult to sleep with the cloying smell.  It probably is time to bury her."

ka7di5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ka7di5/the_witch_house/,The Witch House,89,2,1607570295.0,"Deep in the forests of northern Wisconsin, there’s an old, abandoned cabin, where a witch used to live. 


If you travel over the river and through the woods (seriously? To grandmother's house we go?) You’ll find it, and possibly be inclined to explore it.


Do not. 


If you step inside, you’ll never walk more than a mile away from the cabin again. No matter which direction you walk, you’ll always end up back at that cabin. 


The longer you spend there, the more you’ll forget yourself. Your dreams, hobbies, emotions, memories, all become part of the cabin.


Each time this happens to a traveler, the cabin gets a little nicer, looking less abandoned and more neglected. 


After a few days you’ll start to see someone following you around. You’ll think it’s a hallucination, brought on by hunger or thirst, but you won’t feel either of those things. At least, not to the level that you should. 


If you get close enough to the figure, you’ll notice it looks a little like yourself. 


Small details are off, eye color, hair length, but after a few more days, the figure will correct itself, starting to look exactly like you.


If you look in a mirror, you’ll notice you look like a dried out husk of what you used to be. 


Or maybe that’s just because you lost the memory of what you looked like by now. After all, you’d have been at the cabin for almost a week. 


The doppelgangers used to be terrible. They wouldn’t know how to act once they left the forest, and almost all of them would either end up killing themselves or become institutionalized, mumbling about how “She” wants them back.


The witch takes power from lonesome travelers, you see. That’s why the cabin takes your memories, your essence, and finally, your form. She uses a little bit of this energy to copy you, and send that copy back into the real world, to avoid suspicion. She’s getting better at it, through trial and error, to the point where if you live in Wisconsin, chances are you know at least one person who isn’t what you think they are. She’s gotten good at replicating people by now, and disposing of the remains of the original.


Despite being only alive as a spirit, she’s not stupid. 


At this point, the cabin looks livable. Only a few cracks on the windows, few holes in the walls, just a bit of a fixer upper, compared to the abandoned hut it used to be just years ago. 


You wouldn’t know there were hundreds of dried out bodies buried underneath it.


If you know someone who comes back late from a trip up north, and they start acting a little off, do not follow them the next time they go for a hike. Do not ask them about the cabin, or about Her, maybe just cut them off completely. 


The doppelgangers have started trying to bring people back to that place. "
ka6fkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ka6fkk/sardines/,Sardines,98,10,1607566936.0,"My church's youth group sometimes holds sleepovers, and we play a game that's tense, scary, and very fun: 'Sardines'.

&#x200B;

The rules are simple. All the lights are turned off, everyone gathers in the youth group room, and one or two people go hide. Every few minutes, two more leave to search. When someone is found, the seekers hide with them. The game ends when everyone has found who is hiding, or after 45 minutes.

&#x200B;

Our church is enormous, so it's pretty exciting. When it's pitch-black dark, looking inside every closet and under every table is creepy. And it goes without saying that there are always some kids more concerned with causing mischief than with actually finding who's hiding.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm Alex, and it was about midnight when it was my turn, with my friend Jennie.

&#x200B;

Downstairs has a stretch with several identical rooms, filled with tables, chairs, closets. Lots of kids were too afraid to search every last closet. We squeezed tightly under a long table, where you couldn't be seen just by looking underneath.

&#x200B;

We waited.

&#x200B;

At one point, Matt came into the room by himself, whistling his stupid whistle, asking aloud 'Is anyone in here?' Okay, Matt. ('Here we are! Thanks for asking!')

&#x200B;

He peers under the table, but doesn't see us, and is too scared to actually crawl underneath.

&#x200B;

He walked out of the room. Hilarious.

&#x200B;

Footsteps gradually receded; people started going back upstairs. People are so lazy and afraid!

&#x200B;

About 15 minutes after Matt left, someone else entered the room.

&#x200B;

'I know you're in here,' an unfamiliar voice said. I couldn't make out whose voice it was immediately, but he was trying the same dumb trick as Matt. Yeah, sure: just walk from room to room saying you know we're in there.

&#x200B;

'Come out, come out...' the voice continued.

&#x200B;

Then, abruptly and forcefully, the body slid under the table.

&#x200B;

'Gotcha! Haha.'

&#x200B;

Jennie and I recoiled a bit, because we didn't recognize this person: an adult.

&#x200B;

'No no no!' he reassured us; he must have felt me jolt. 'Don't be scared. I'm Pastor Kyle, a friend of Pastor Betty's. I told her I'd show up tonight but I wanted to make a big entrance. It'll be hilarious when we go upstairs together.'

&#x200B;

'Shh! Let's talk afterward', said Jennie.

&#x200B;

30 minutes went by, and, as usual when someone hides in an obscure spot downstairs, we won. Pastor Betty blew her whistle and everyone returned upstairs. Jennie, Pastor Kyle and I crawled out from under.

&#x200B;

'Wow! I can't believe nobody found you,' said Pastor Kyle.

&#x200B;

'Well, you did,' laughed Jennie.

&#x200B;

'Guess so!' replied Pastor Kyle. 'Hey, I've gotta use the restroom. I'll meet you guys upstairs.'

&#x200B;

We went upstairs.

&#x200B;

'Where were you?!' asked Jeff.

&#x200B;

'Downstairs under a table! You guys are such scaredy-cats. Only Pastor Kyle found us,' I said. 'Pastor Betty, Pastor Kyle's here and he'll be up in a minute.'

&#x200B;

Pastor Betty looked at me quizzically.

&#x200B;

'Who's Pastor Kyle?'"

I've been hearing a tapping on my window for about 10 minutes so far, paired with this terrible crying, gasping sound. It started at around 11pm and is still going on. It doesn't follow any particular pattern, though. I've listened for one. It just kind of taps, exactly the way a human being might tap to get someone's attention through the glass.

Windows are shut tight, thankfully, and the shutters are drawn so I can't be seen, but the taps are loud. Not breaking-the-glass loud, but loud. It has been increasing in volume, actually. More like banging now.

I don't live anywhere near a tree, so that can't be it. I'm too scared to look and see what it might be, as that would involve getting closer to the window than I'd like. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated.

Wait- I think it's stopped now.

Help. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.

I've been tapping on someone's window trying to get their attention for about 10 minutes now. I'd been followed by a strange guy while walking home from the club, and ended up running to get away from him as he chased after me. I finally lost him, but he can't be far behind and it's only a matter of time before he finds me again.
 
I ended up in a strange neighborhood as I ran (for TWENTY FULL MINUTES, which left me gasping for breath loudly) and my phone's on 2% battery. No one's picked up when I called them. I'm on my own. I'm so scared. I can't help it, I'm gonna cry.

Why won't this person open up?! Can they not hear me? Should I tap louder? DO I NEED TO BANG ON THIS GLASS?! No, I need to stay somewhat quiet, better chances if survival. Oh please, don't let him find me. Don't let me die here.

# - - -

The water treatment facility was abuzz with engineers and excitement on this cold Moscow morning. The counter-revolutionaries had held it for months, imbuing it with a defiant symbolism which their defeat had so beautifully transformed into a symbol of victory for the revolution. All eyes were on the work being done here, and that work was progressing.

Already, undesirable elements (bourgeoisie, intellectuals, kulaks) were being rounded up, and the bleeding chambers had been constructed and fitted into the existing infrastructure. In essence, the plant's inputs were being switched. As trumpeted by official propaganda, yesterday's enemies would become tomorrow's lifeblood—literally: entire masses kept like cattle, given just enough nourishment to keep them alive so that their treacherous hearts could pump blood for the world's first vampiric state, The Union of Vampire Socialist Republics.

Moscow's would be first of hundreds of such facilities. The model on which the success of the others would depend.

The revolution had promised the flow of blood.

The revolution must deliver.

Preobrazhensky knew that what this really meant was that he, newly-appointed Minister of Hemo- and Agriculture, must deliver.

He passed a group of huddled undesirables, fresh off one of the eastern trains, and felt a pang of sympathy—but only a pang. These were the same savages who for centuries had hunted and killed his species. So many stabbings; so much hatred. As a filthy boy reached for his overcoat, Preobrazhensky forced himself to see the child solely as blood-potential. *The younger, the better*, Preobrazhensky reminded himself. *The revolution demands an iron will.*
# - - -

St. Petersburg's Winter Palace was cacophonous. A multitude of exhilarated voices speaking hurriedly and at once over a faint but violent backdrop of gunfire and explosions. Hopes and dreams mixed with practical realities and intra-party ideological disputes about some obscure aspect of vampirosocialism. Then Lenin, unfanged as was now the custom, called order for roll call. Goblets of blood circulated and one-by-one the names were read: Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Stalin, Preobrazhensky...

The civil war was present too, but everyone agreed the Reds were winning, and it was time to formally announce the revolutionary state. After weeks of negotiations, the outline was clear. The vampires had reached agreement with the urban proletariat (small enough to be pummeled into obedience) and non-kulak peasantry (hungry and fearful) to enslave and liquidate the remaining classes.

The humans would be allowed autonomous republics, but to the vampires would go the cities and, through their dominance in the Party, the economy, foreign policy, army and police. The vampires would thereby control all internal and external state policies. Although they were a minority, they were an ancient, well-organized one, and every day their ranks swelled.

Foreign vampires crossed the border *en masse* to join the Motherland of World Vampirism.

Preobrazhensky watched Lenin ascend the platform, reveal his fangs and address the gathering crowd. After he finished—

""Peace! Land! Blood!"" they chanted.

The revolution had begun."

Smashing the door down with an almighty thump, he stepped through, gun in hand. He didn't need a mask. Everybody knew who he was, but he was so damn good that he didn't need to worry about getting caught.

""I want your money, not your life!"" He shouted. ""But I won't think twice if you make a move!""

I scrambled upstairs, desperately trying to buy some time from him before he changed his mind.

""Just give me the goods and I'll be on my way! I'd hate to leave blood over a carpet as beautiful as this!"" He taunted me, like taking everything I had wasn't enough for him.

What was it gran always used to say about invaders? That they must die? No, that was The Prodigy, but she might have said that, too.

The box? Yes, the box! In her room! All sorts of supernatural phenomena was in there, but she told me to never open it unless it was an emergency. I mean, if getting all of our shit robbed wasn't an emergency, I'd loved to see my gran in the throes of a gang war.

""Very well!"" He cried, and he started to climb up the stairs. ""Remember, you brought this on yourself!""

I swung her bedroom door open with an ee-ur, and after locking it, I fished around in the box in her drawer. Where was it? Where was it?

He burst through, with the same gusto that he had with the front door, but this time I was ready for him.

""Any last words?"" He said with a cocky grin, as he pointed the gun towards me.

""No... u."" I replied, as I pointed the holy uno reverse card towards him.

His eyes widened in terror. ""No! Y-you can't! It's not possible! The real ones got banned years ago!"" He started to turn the gun around, and he stared down the barrel with a look of utter fear.

I smiled, a smug grin that threatened to eat my face, ""I. Just. Did.""

He cocked his gun, where was that smile now, buddy? Did the card reverse that, too?

*Bang.*

His head exploded into pieces as the bullet fired through his skull. Blood and a strange yellow goo popped out and stained the carpet as he crumpled to the floor. The great bandit, that had been terrorizing everybody in my neighbourhood, was no more.

I sighed, stood up, and put the card back in the box. I got to sweeping, but every time I tried to clean the yellow goo, the brush turned around, and I started to sweep my face.

Come see the mummified sauropod!” A very amateur graphic of a dinosaur sarcophagus graced the bottom of the flier. There was no date or location. The flier didn’t even have to say that a carnival was coming to town; no other industry was so steeped in grift. It was genius, and I had to go.

I took a detour passed the fairgrounds on my way to school every day until I saw carnies’ setting up one morning. They were erecting a sheet-metal fence on the midway. I asked one when the carnival would open, and, before he could finish telling me to come back that evening, I blurted, “Is the dinosaur behind there?” out.

“Longer than a python! Taller than a giraffe! Heavier than an elephant!” he said.

I came back after supper and went straight to the dinosaur. At the entrance to the exhibit, I was told that there was an admission fee of one fresh sprig of lily of the valley. I asked where I was going to find that and was told to try the house of mirrors.

Reflections of a spray of lily hung in the mirrors like mistletoe over a doorway, but I couldn’t find the plant. I searched until I walked into a mirror and hit my nose hard enough to bleed. The bell blossoms shook with a pistil-on-petal chime. I grabbed a tissue from the packet in my hoodie pouch, stopped my nostrils, and exited. “Hey loser,” said a girl while I was outside looking up and pinching my nose. I immediately turned to see who was calling me. “They won’t let me ride the Ferris wheel alone, and I don’t want to sit next to a random weirdo. Come on; at the top, we’ll probably be able to see the dinosaur over the fence.” Her voice was as sweet and imperious as a gumdrop hurricane.

“Do you think it’s gonna look real?” I asked when our ascent began.

“It is real,” she said, “and a mistake. Dead things should be small. That’s why we bury people in a little box in a little grave. The grave grinds people down until they’re nothing but a patch of discolored earth. The pharaohs preserved themselves in pyramids and became bigger in death than life. The carnival is the same, a tomb swollen to bursting”

As the wheel raised us above the fence, the mummified sauropod came into view. The patrons who swarmed round with lilies in their hands were insectile by comparison. They tore the linen from its head and uncovered an eye, brown, supple, and dry like a bowl of butterscotch pudding that’s grown a skin. They tore the linen from its cheekless jaw, and the beast lowed.

“They fell ages ago,” she said, “but now it stands.”"

Guess you could say it’s become a tradition now. Every couple of years I move to a new part of the country, under a new name, and apply for office jobs. At the interview I always ask if they do Secret Santa, which they always find adorable for some reason. 

To me there’s nothing adorable, you’re welcoming a gift from someone who is essentially a stranger. There could be anything wrapped up in there, and sometimes there is.

I volunteer to be the one going round asking if people are taking part, putting their names down. I’m just so helpful, and everyone loves me for it. Doing my part for Christmas spirit, I tell them with a smile on my face.

I never drop this act, right through to the blessed day itself. When everyone’s just so excited to see what they got, I’m right there with them. Ready to rip open the wrapping paper and feign delight at whatever cheap crap someone has seen fit to give me. 

But I know something no one else does.

Sure, I’ve bought a standard gift for the person I actually got. Something pleasant. I’ve also got a present for someone else. Someone I don’t like. 

There’s always one. Sometimes more than one actually! One who wrongs me in some way, one who I just dislike, one who has got away with too much. My present for this person is always something a bit special.

I find out what they love most, other than their family. That’s boring. They might say an object for example, and that’s easy. You wouldn’t believe how many people say pets. It’s always awkward with pets. 

Then for their present I give them a piece of what it is they love. It could be that same object smashed into pieces, a paw, a collar, an eye. Something to let them know that precious thing is gone, but they can have a small part of it back. Something they can hang onto.

The reaction is always priceless, and the subsequent “oh my god who could do this” melodrama. I play my part, act shocked. Fingers are pointed. Everyone knows who got my Secret Santa, I make sure of that. 

No-one suspects me, I’m too timid. I’m too polite. I’m too generous.

I’m just too Christmassy.

At least it was a feeling the first time I can remember it. I was maybe sevens years old, visiting my grandmother. Her bathroom was in the basement of her old house. It always felt so dark, even during summer. I can remember the hollow feeling in my stomach as I walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. Seeing my reflection while at the same time feeling the history of the old bathroom. Every time I went down there, I had a feeling of someone standing behind me. Like something was watching me from afar. As I grew older, I brushed it off as my childish imagination. The irrational fear of children. 

The second time I can remember the sensation, was in my late teens at a party. I am sure that I saw something small behind me in every mirror, a humanoid creature far away in the background. Again, the feeling of being watched crept up on me. It stayed for a few days, before it went away again. I had just discovered the joy of alcohol and brushed it off as my drunk imagination. 

The third time was in my mid-twenties. I was lucky, being able to buy an old apartment outside of town. It was small and well used, but it was mine. The second night as I was brushing my teeth and looking into the mirror, I saw something in the corner of the room. A shadow was standing behind me. I was terrified and turned around only to see nothing. The awareness of being watched every time I went into the bathroom came back to me. The next night it was still there, but only in the mirror. Standing in the shadow, and I never got a good look at it. I tried to put things in the way so that it had to move. Then I was unable to see the creature, however, the feeling lingered, I could sense the presence. After some time, I got used to it. As a grown man you do not go around telling people that you see things in the shadow. I was terrified and wondering if I was going insane, then one night the presence was gone.  

Years passed and everything was normal. However, after last night I now know that I must tell someone. I can see the creature it is standing next to me in every mirror. A distorted face, that I am unable to focus on, except the big grinning mouth. It just stands there half a meter behind me, and it does not move. I have the feeling that it is hungry. 

Tonight, I am going to smash the mirror."

I remember those high school girls who said I was handsome, but I was so shy that I couldn't even look them in the eyes. I guess that's why they thought I was cute, because they couldn't look me in the eye.

I guess that random girl was right, she said that I was the ugliest kid in high school. Years have passed and I still can't decide how people see me.

I wonder what they would think of me if they saw me now, third year in college. Damn, even I can't believe I'm a medical student. Dad would be proud.

I still remember this guy I met in my freshman year of college, he said that doctors are supposed to be good looking. I guess he was trying to say something, right?

I was there, watching everything.

Obnoxiously loud. The kind of loud that rattles your windows and makes your dishes shake. The kind of loud that means I can’t focus on my homework, and often can’t even sleep in my own home. The kind of loud that, you would think, would lead to some kind of complaint. 

But that’s just the thing, nobody ever does, or rather, won’t. Every time someone goes in there the exact same thing happens. The person marches up to the house, ready to shut the place down, only to be welcomed on with open arms. They all walk inside, and at first it seems to work. The music stops, all the partygoers head inside, and silence falls on the house. Then you realize something is off. Nobody comes out of the house, not even the person who was supposed to shut the party down, or the partiers from the previous night. Just complete and still silence.

That’s when the screams start.

The screams are constant and devoid of any emotion. They don’t  sound like screams of pain, or fear, or anything else. They are just... screams. They seem to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. Anyone who hadn’t heard them before would have no reason to think they came from that house in particular. After a couple of hours or so they just shut off with no real rhyme or reason. There’s no signal from the house that I’ve seen, and no exact time either.  Sometimes they’ll stop after a half hour, other times they continue until almost noon.

Exactly ten minutes after the screams stop, our neighbor and the person who went to complain come out of his house and start to clean. After everything is cleaned up, the neighbor goes back into the house and the complainer returns to his home with no memory of the previous night. None of the people from the party are ever seen again. 

You would think that all these disappearances would get him arrested, but nobody ever recognizes any of the people from his parties, and whenever the police search his house(during the day of course. They know what happens when people go at night) they all ways come up empty handed. It’s as if the people never existed in the first place."

My stupid GPS certainly hadn’t mapped out rural Missouri very thoroughly. I bought it to prevent getting turned around in the boonies, but it always seemed to draw a blank when I needed it the most. These highways always look the same to me too, just pastures of cows accented by dozens of billboards, alternating between advertising the newest Branson shows and telling me I’m going to hell.

1:15 am, driving home from a girl’s house that I wasn’t supposed to see, and I’m fucking lost. Excellent.

Oh look, another church. That’s helpful.

Did I miss my exit? Am I even on the right highway? Where the hell am I?

I sigh, turning onto the nearest street I see, some gravel road with numbers instead of a name.

Ahead of me there's a flickering orange glow, both ominous and inviting. After a few moments of just staring, it dawns on me that I’m witnessing the biggest fire I’ve ever seen and at the center of it is someone’s home. I look around for neighbors but all I can see is forest. I don’t hear any sirens or see any lights.

I dig around my backpack for my Nokia.

*“911, what's your emergency?”*

“Yeah, I was driving, um, I’m somewhere sorta close to highway 37, I think, and there’s a house, it’s on fire.”

*“Can you give me an address? Nearby intersection?”*

I glance down at my GPS. According to TomTom I’m still driving through an uninhabited field of grey. I mean, I’m in rural Missouri, that’s not too far off I guess.

“No, I’m lost. I don’t even know what town I’m in.”

*“I’m sorry ma’am, but without an address of some sort, there’s nothin' I can do.”*

“Oh. Alright. Well, just keep an eye out for smoke I guess. Goodbye.”

I toss my phone back in my backpack and get out to watch the house burn. It’s kind of beautiful. I lie to myself that I’m just sticking around until the fire department shows up.

The flames have completely consumed the three story behemoth. Looks like it was one of those massive McMansions, made out of cheap materials and cut corners.

My stomach drops as I look closer. On the top level, a plastic crib lives up to its flame-retardant promise. And, next to what looks like the remains of a wrought-iron bed, is a lump, curled up on the floor.

It could be a dog. It could be a person.

I’m telling myself that it’s a dog, but that feels like a lie even before the floor collapses, and I see the scrap of checkered fabric clinging to their arm as they fall.

I jump back in the truck, frantically fumbling for my phone. Just as I’m about to dial 911 again, I remember.

I don’t know where I am.

Without an address, they can’t do anything.

I throw the pickup in reverse and back out, heading back to the highway."

Countless times she heard a knock by her front door, and each time she opens them, nobody was there. Her wallet would not agree on the thought of her having a CCTV just to caught a few naughty kids on her door step, knocking then flee somewhere.

It has been 3 years since she's been in this house, the knocking happened on her 2nd year, and now she's on her 3rd year, she had called the authorities before, they found nothing. Exactly what she had expected.

*Knock*

This time she had enough, she went to the door, mumbling some curses under her breath and opens the door in front of her to see nothing but an empty street. She rolled her eyes and slammed the door shut behind her. That night she done her night routine as always, locking the doors and the windows. 

She laid down on her bed, closing in to her deep slumber.

*Knock*

Her eyes were shot open, she looked around her, the door by her bedroom were still locked. She turned on the night lamp beside her and takes the bat under her bed, her sense of fight or flight is alert now. 

*Knock*

This time the knock came closer to her room, the cold sweat were running down her body, her hands were holding the bat shakily, her feet feels numb and cold by now. She scoots over to her phone, trying to dial 911 as fast as possible.

*Knock*

The knock was nearer than before, she looked at her bedroom door, the knob never turned whatsoever, the air was still. Her nerves were slowly soothing down even though the chills were creeping up on her, not until the door by her closet creaks open to a small gap, with a long black rake-like hand scratches the door, followed by a head with no mouth and a hollow socket."

I was 12 years old at the time. My parents left to go to a party around 10 PM and weren’t supposed to be back until 3-4 AM so I basically had all night to myself. At about 1 AM I was watching YouTube and eating snacks. Just then, I heard a loud and heavy knock on my front door.

 “They’re home already?” I thought. I was surprised because they shouldn’t be home for at least another hour. I went to the front door and looked through the peep hole. I was surprised to see not my parents standing there but a big, bulky man with tattered clothes at my door. He had a stubble beard, glasses and long, unkept hair. I was very startled considering I had never seen this man in my life. Then a deep voice came from the other side.

“Open the door.” An immediate chill went down my spine. I don’t know why but the man’s voice struck fear into my heart. I had never met this man in my life. How did he know where I live? I then heard something that I will never forget.

“James. Let me in.” I was frozen with fear. How did he know my name? I immediately ran to my parents' room. I remembered the safe my dad kept in the closet. I went and unlocked the safe and grabbed my dad’s Beretta M9 and loaded it with a 15-round magazine. I then heard loud pounding. I look at the camera monitor in my dad’s room. He was kicking the door. Then I heard a loud thud as the door fell off its hinges. I ran out of my dad’s room and looked down the stairs. I saw him inside the house. Then he looked directly at me. My heart dropped. He started towards me slowly. I ran back into my dad’s room and locked the door. I pulled out my phone and called the police. They said some police officers were on the way.

I then heard pounding on the door. I aimed the handgun at the door. The door then swung open. The large man emerged in the doorway, I shot him. He screamed in agony and fell to the floor. Then I heard the police bust in and I saw their flashlights in the hallway. I felt instant relief. Then they appeared in the doorway. They then called an ambulance and put the man in handcuffs. They brought me outside and called my parents.

Thirty minutes later, my parents showed up. My mom ran over and hugged me. An officer came over and said that I did the right thing and that I didn’t have a choice. I was traumatized. The sound of the bang and the man falling. That image will forever be in my mind."

In Seattle, Washington, a twenty-something man sees the twenty-something love of his life for the first time. They're at a private party atop the Space Needle. The man has brown hair; he's of average height and weight. The woman has blue eyes that sparkle like sapphires in the dim light.

In Los Angeles, California, a robotics engineer at CalTech examines tick-like clusters of nanomachines contained in a holding tank. They're consuming the organic matter they're designed to consume. The machines are replicating rapidly; the organic matter disintegrates. But the engineer notices a hole in the holding tank. Feeling a stinging sensation, he looks down at his leg. Millions upon millions of microscopic machines, forming what looks like a gray, gangrenous blanket, are making their way up his leg, unstitching his skin with pinprick claws.

He moves to hit a red button labeled ""STOP,"" which will emit an electromagnetic pulse, killing the nanomachines. But his leg breaks under the weight; the machines have burrowed into the marrow. Unbeknownst to the engineers looking on, the machines have also disabled the lab's emergency systems. They continue multiplying, covering the walls, pouring through the lab's vents and into the ductwork. 

The Chief Science Officer steps in.

""Shut it off! Now!""

""I can't!"" replies an engineer. ""They've disabled the system!""

*""Close - off - the - lab!""* the CSO wheezes.  

He's hyperventilating, marbles of sweat bead on his pale skin. The engineer grabs the CSO by the collar, her eyes peeled in terror like skinless grapes. 

""THIS DOESN'T GET FIXED! DON'T YOU FUCKING REALIZE THAT?!""

They're consumed in seconds. The nanomachines continue multiplying. Within thirty seconds, Los Angeles is reduced to concrete. In three minutes, the machines have consumed California, Nevada, Arizona, and Oregon.

At the Space Needle, the countdown to New Years' commences. The twenty-year-old star-crossed lovers stare into one another's eyes. 

*10, 9, 8, 7...*

They lean close; their champagne-tinged breath mingles; her cotton candy lips are centimeters from his. 

*6, 5, 4…*

They smile. The ball finishes its descent. 

*3, 2…*

At the exact second they kiss, the nanomachines and the biomass become one. The Space Needle crumbles—the twenty-somethings fall to their death.

In orbit, an astronaut finishing his tour on the International Space Station looks down. He's performing maintenance outside the ship. The Earth is a blue-green beauty. The astronaut realizes that he's watching New Years' from space.

But he notices something strange. The Earth is turning gray. There is no light left. A monochromatic wave washes the globe; the beautiful blue-green orb becomes a shell.

Searching for comfort, the astronaut sings a song he remembers from childhood.

""Should auld acquaintance be forgot...and days of auld lang syne…""

*For old time's sake.*

The lights in the space station go out. Comms are dark. No one in the station responds.

The astronaut is alone in the universe: the last surviving human."

As I walked past the door, dust flies. The curtains are ripped, doors are broken and rotten, and most of the paintings are unrecognizable anymore.

As I went deeper into the mansion, I hear screams.

I rush towards the room to the source of it. There, I saw a woman and two men. Seems like an interrogation of some kind. I went in and sat down beside them, and they didn’t seem to mind me. 

“Ma’am, tell us what happened.”

“YOU ALWAYS SAY I LIE, EVEN THOUGH I TELL THE TRUTH. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I TELL THE TRUTH YET YOU DON’T WANT IT”

I tried to butt in. “Ma’am, please calm down.”

She keeps repeating the same words over and over again, and the two gentleman seem to lose their patience as time went by. One of them tried to restrain the tantrum of the woman.

This went on until the woman suddenly stopped. Dead. 

“How the fuck did she die?”

“I don’t want to fucking know. Let’s get out of here!”

They ran towards the door, and I went with them. I’m part of the murder, and the guilt keeps crushing my soul as tears blurs my vision.

Have you ever noticed the perfection of a door? I cannot stop staring at my front door which is a beautiful solid mahogany piece with carvings all over. Little flowers and curvy shapes around the frame, the doorknob glowing in rustic gold like a jewel. It’s almost like the creator of the door wanted to encourage people to knock, to come in, to make the door serve its purpose as much as possible. Of course, doors are not there to be closed, rather be opened times and times again, because a closed door is a useless door. Not this one. This is a door that is inviting your friends over for a meal and a good time. A door that is promising the beauty of the world on both sides. I just cannot stop staring. I have a lovely front door. I only wish as lay here in a pool of my blood waiting to be discovered, my unmoving gaze fixed on my front door, that I locked it last night."
k9h4x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k9h4x4/the_fermi_paradox/,The Fermi Paradox,2124,55,1607474636.0,"This terminal limits me to no more than 500 words, so I’ll make it brief. 


The Fermi paradox is the problem that the universe should be teeming with life, yet we can’t find any of it. 


There are theories; the Great Filter got them, they exist but we can’t comprehend them, and finally the most popular; they were too far away. 


It took us decades, but we finally developed faster than light travel. I won’t bore you with all of the complicated math, but it involved the disruption of dark matter, the type of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. By pushing dark matter and a certain frequency of radiation together, we could move atoms at a speed that surpassed light. This turned the dark matter into what’s called hot dark matter, which became capable of temporarily lowering an object's mass, allowing it to move faster than 299,792,458 m/s, aka the speed of light. We could finally explore the universe and figure out if we were alone or not.


I was on the ship that left Earth. We were to orbit the planet for a few weeks, converting dark matter into hot dark matter, and finally take off in the direction of the Wow signal, our best guess at a location for intelligent life.


Despite our breakthrough, we still knew very little of the composition of dark matter. We figured out how to manipulate it, but like a child playing with a weapon, we had no idea how truly dangerous that was. 


We had no idea dark matter is, in a way we cannot comprehend, alive. 


I don’t know why it took the planet instead of the ship. This is speculation, but I think when we changed dark matter, we HURT it, in a way that a carbon based animal cannot comprehend. 


While orbiting, we got a distress signal from control. A giant, almost undetectable mass was surrounding Earth, and suddenly, any baryonic matter (matter made of atoms) began to change, shrinking in size. The distance between chemical bonds became smaller, until they merged into single atoms. All of humanity, and the planet, merged together into a plasma-like mass, before dissipating, like a star would after dying. 


We tried contacting control, but I don’t think any of us expected a response. 


Only two people remain in my crew. We were sitting down for another silent dinner when I decided to type this all up. The others lost hope much faster than us., but we’re getting there.


I guess the Great Filter was right after all. I wonder how many other civilizations cracked the code of faster than light travel, only to be destroyed by the force they sought control over. 


We can’t leave. We can’t travel faster, because the dark matter will wipe us out. We can’t fly away, because we don’t have a reasonable destination to go to.


All we can do is orbit where Earth used to be, regretting humanity's greatest discovery."

The cries of my sister begging her to stop all while asking why is she doing this. **I didn't care**.

I continued to play with my brown toy car without a wince of remorse for my sister getting beat to death. I remember her cries and her plead of help to me, all while I sat playing with my brown toy car, that look she would give me as I would do absolutely nothing to help because, well I want to say it's because I was too young to understand but no, I came to a realization that I don't care, In fact I've never cared. Why would I? But why would I not? She is my sister after all. **Yet I don't care?**

Questions get filled in my mind wondering if there is something heavily wrong with me but I just can't understand. As I've grown older I start having flashbacks to that one memory. Stuff that a young boy tries to forget but stuff that isn't easily forgotten. Yet why? Why is my only memory that I can remember me playing with that brown toy car and her pleading for my help. I sit down in my sofa wondering if I should try to remember more but in the end. **I don't care**."

I collapsed unto the hard wooden back of the coffin. It was small, the darkness encompassing, limiting my vision so severely that even my hand was lost in the inky black. I sucked in a breath, the musty stench filling my throat.

I let my mind go back, trying to shatter the barrier that limited my memories. The memories slowly came back, the gibberish of images flashing in my mind. There were umbrellas. Rain. What did they mean?

Something moved, and I felt a sensation of something crawling along my arm. I shoved myself back against the wall of the coffin, my eyes darting frantically as they tried to focus on something in the dark. 

I was alone. Surely would someone look for me, right? *Right?*

*Would my husband look for me?*

Something clicked. Chunks of my memories rushed back, making my head dizzy as I tried to comprehend them. Dead, my husband was dead. They said it was from food poisoning. I gasped, hyperventilating. I was at a funeral. It was his funeral. And he was dead. Dead, dead and gone. 

Something groaned, knocking me out of my stupor. It didn’t sound human, far from that, the noise broken and twisted, entwined with despair. 

More memories. It was his birthday. There was cake. A bottle. 

A wet, squishy sound reached my ears. Something was in here. 

The coffin felt like it was breathing; the walls moving at a steady rhythm. It felt wet, and I felt something sticky splash onto my face. I squeezed my eyes shut, my breathing labored.

""I don’t want to die"" I whispered, my voice cracking as tears spilled in waves from my eyes.""Please,"" I gasped. 

I pressed further against the wall of the coffin, and it felt \*strange\*. It had lost its hard wooden feel, feeling more warm and soft. Moist, like an animal’s insides. 

Something rasped from the darkness once more. But now I can hear what was being said. 

“Ellie” it crowed, and oh god it sounded so close. I felt its breath, hot and suffocating against my ear. 

It was saying my name. It was saying my *name.* 

""Why,"" it murmured. *""Why, why, why.”* 

Then everything came back, not minor events, but *everything.* I had poisoned him. My own husband was dead from me. Why did I do it? *Why?*

I felt multiple small things crawl their way up my body, digging their needle-like legs into my eyes, my ears, my mouth. I struggled against it, feeling them dig holes into my skin, puncturing my eyes, crawling down my throat. 

I was in my husband’s grave, and now I will pay for what I did. 

The thing laughed, and I let out a strangled scream as my body was slowly ripped apart."

“Where am I,” I thought, “Am I dead?” I looked around, examining the room I was in, if it could be called a room. Everything around me was this dark brown color, everything except for behind me.

There were 10 doors, 5 in the top row, 5 in the bottom. 4 of them were open, 6 were closed, each seeming oddly familiar. Then I recognized them.

The first door was the door to my dorm, when I went to university. The third door was from my first hotel in New York, the fifth showing a balcony view of the city. The second, sixth, and seventh were from my honeymoon (a trip to Rome), the closed door being from our hotel there. The fourth was from the hotel me and my wife stayed at. The eighth and the last were from the house we purchased after Jonathan was born. The ninth was from our trip to Japan we took for fun, which included some hiking, camping, and great food.

Then I remembered, each of these memories, I messed something up. The dorm room door, my room was a mess, and so was I. The trip to Japan, I lost my cool and flipped out at my wife because we each wanted to do completely different things. The balcony… I’d rather not think about what would happen if the police weren’t called.

“I’m going to have to relive these memories, aren’t I?” I realized ""This is purgatory."" I reluctantly entered the first door, reliving my past. "

I never felt comfortable and I was all alone and far away from mommy and daddy. I didn’t like the wind’s special howls it made only at nighttime, especially the sound of the crooked tree branches knocking on my window. The light that found its way into my room would morph into different shapes and they always looked scary… they would also come towards me close to the ground until I didn’t see it anymore because I covered my entire head with my duvet. 

Every time I would cover my head, everything would stop. 

The howling. 

The knocking. 

Then that heaviness on me would dawn like an attack… there was something there... I could always feel it and I knew better than to look… 

Tonight, it was Daddy’s turn to tuck me into bed. My parents would always read my favorite story to me each night but I’m thinking of switching to the biggest novel I have as my favorite because this story is too short and I want them to stay longer!

“Daddy, please don’t turn off the light, I’m scared.”

“My child, there is no need to be scared when I am here”

“But what about the woman…”

“What woman?”

“The woman who comes at night after the wind calls her… I can hear her… I can see her… she looks at me from under the bed-”

“Enough! There is no woman under the bed. It’s just your imagination. Don’t worry child, you are safe.”

I grabbed his hand tight as he closed the book and kissed my forehead and I begged him to stay so that we could be safe together. So I could protect him with my braveness even. I wouldn’t be scared if we were together. I would be like batman and fight off evil.

He retrieved his hand reassuring me and turned me around facing away from him and tucked me in tight. As he walked to the door he stopped. 

“There is no woman under the bed.” 

At that he turned off the light and went to his room to sleep. 

I woke up the next day to the smell of pancakes and jolted out of bed in the brightly lit room excitedly. I ran downstairs and took my place at the dining table smacking my lips in wait.
“Good morning dear,” mom said kissing me. 

“Mornin’ mom”

“Good morning son,” dad said scraping the pancakes off the pan onto my plate.

“Mornin’ dad”

Cold Feet by Loud Luxury was blasting on the radio as my seat warmers were fighting against the bitter cold outside. It was dark, but serene, with not another car in sight. The winding road faded in and out of view as my headlights scanned through the forest around me. 

The night was cold but calm, and the trees around me were still. That was, until a massive branch bowed down in front of me, nearly scraping my roof as I swerved around it. I over corrected and nearly wound up in a ditch, looking behind myself to see that the branch had disappeared. 

Chalking it up to a product of my fatigue, I turned up the AC, struggling to remain alert. It was then that I noticed my music had stopped playing. Not only that, but I couldn’t hear a thing. No whirring of my car’s engine, no humming of the air conditioner, not even a ringing in my head as I often felt during moments of silence. 

The road continued to stretch ahead of me, ever curving in the same direction. Had I missed my turn? Surely, I would have driven in a full circle by now, as there was no way the road spiraled. 

I decided to pull over and check my map, just to be safe. However, when I tried to press the brakes, they were locked in place. My steering wheel didn’t budge, and even my turn signal was fixed in place. 

I’ve been on this road for days now. I expected to get hungry, thirsty, or at least tired, but I haven’t. My car seems to be driving itself now, not that it matters- everything around me has been slowly fading into blackness. Only the road ahead of me remains. My seatbelt won’t unbuckle, so I couldn’t lay down if I wanted to. I’m stuck here, and I don’t think there’s anything I can do. 

As my surroundings slowly disappeared into the darkness, I’ve accepted my fate. Welcomed it, really. Because as scared as I am that I might disappear too, I’m a hell of a lot more scared of what will happen if I don’t."

“Are you sure you can’t fix it hon?”

Standing in front of his smoking 2003 Ford Escort, Alfred was looking under the hood to try to understand what was wrong with it.

“Lou, I’m doing my best here, but I don’t think that’ll be enough.” He scratched his head for a while longer before peering around the hood at his fiancée. “Could you get ahold of what’s-her-name, my insurance lady?”

She thought for a bit, then replied, “Beth? I mean, I could try, but the reception is spotty out here in the boonies.” Glancing worriedly at the single bar of service on her phone, Lou found Beth's listing in her contacts and dialed the number. “Even if the call gets through, what’re the chances that she’ll be available this late at night?”

“You’re probably right, but you never know! We may get lucky.” Alfred had returned to the front of the car and was trying to find the source of the smoke. After a few more seconds of searching and ringing, Lou said, “No such luck—nothing but dial tones.”

Alfred let out a frustrated sigh. “I’m not finding anything up here either, everything looks mostly fine.” 

“Then what do we do?” replied a slightly panicked Lou.

The equally panicked Alfred wracked his brain for a few seconds before saying, “Well, we passed an old farmhouse not too long ago, maybe they’ll let us use their phone?”

&#x200B;

After a short walk back the way they came, Alfred and Lou got to the farmhouse. It didn’t seem empty, so they made their way to the door. However, before they were able to knock, a well-groomed man in a suit opened the door to greet them.

“Welcome travelers! How may we assist you?”

Taken aback by the man, Alfred said, “We? Who's we?”

“Ah, my apologies, I haven’t even introduced ourselves!” A few more men and women in fancy clothes behind the man took interest in the exchange happening at the door. “We call ourselves Hominem Comedenti, but that’s just a name. We’re simply a small community of like-minded individuals that love to have passersby in for a meal.”

“Well, we are kinda hungry,” said Lou, “but we really just need to use your phone--we don’t want to be a bother.”

With a devilish grin, the man replied, “Trust me, the pleasure would be ours! It’s been so long since we’ve had *guests* for dinner.”

Alfred looked more carefully around the room at the others, only now noticing their hungered stares and predatory gait. Before he could get another word out, two men pounced on the pair, immobilizing them. After being bound and gagged, the young lovers were dragged into the house, never to be seen again.

The man smiled to himself, satisfied with the work of his underlings whom he had taught so long ago. “I’m so proud of this community of mine.”"

FAMINE came and went. Millions cried out, malnourished, while the others gorged themselves in their homes, thankful they were born lucky and privileged. So many that could have lived to change the world slowly starved instead. Their cries largely went ignored, as people assumed someone with authority could make the changes the poor needed.


    PESTILENCE arrived second, in the form of a pandemic. The initial death toll was low, so not everyone took it seriously. Had they bothered to learn about the long term effects, things could have been different. Millions perished years after the outbreak, their lungs collapsing into soup. The bodies had to be burned to ensure the virus couldn’t spread to a healthy host. 


    WAR was much louder than the others. With the total population on a decline, manufacturing became difficult, so resources became scarce. There were multiple conflicts for multiple resources, first a war for oil, then a war for food and water, most tragically was a war for freedom, as some of the poor had become slaves towards the end. 


    DEATH was final, by far the loudest, but the slowest of the four. The nukes took billions of lives when they coated the planet, but the fallout and radiation took so many more, over such a long time. For all its flaws, our once beautiful world was no longer hospitable, though people still tried to survive. Those unfortunate enough to survive this far had sickness and pain to look forward to. Many took their own lives when they had the opportunity, others survival instincts wouldn’t let them, and they suffered on until their bodies couldn’t any longer. The last human to die was a little boy, frightened and in great pain, wondering if he would see his mommy again.


    It’s easy to try to blame all this on divine intervention, a cosmic apocalypse, or even four mythical beings bringing destruction where they ride. 


    But the truth, the awful god damned truth of it all was much simpler. 


    There were no horsemen, there was no religious war, there was no higher power controlling destiny. 


    There was only ever the kingdom of Man, and the choices that they made."

I took an early one because it was less crowded, and got off several stops short to listen to podcasts while walking the rest of the way. It was my favourite part of the day, strolling timelessly between the giant warehouses, before the daily bullying inevitably began. In the afternoons I repeated the route in reverse, and it was while waiting for the bus that I met Szandra.

She looked sixty and always wore the same clothes, patched black jacket, leather boots and jeans, no matter the weather. She never wore a hat, even in the winter, and her long, greying hair fluttered wildly in the slightest breeze.

The first times we saw each other we didn't say a word. But weeks passed and we remained the only two people at the bus stop, and eventually we started talking. First small talk, then more. I found out her name, that she was Hungarian and that she worked in a nearby sporting goods warehouse.

Although we were separated by almost every metric imaginable (age, sex, ethnicity) we understood each other perfectly. She told me about her life in Hungary and how she had come to Canada alone, and I told her about my lonely home life and the bullying I suffered at school.

We sat beside each other on the bus and talked the whole ride. Although I loved my podcasts, I sacrificed them gladly for conversations with Szandra.

Around the middle of Grade 11, the bullying worsened. It stopped being incidental. They started seeking me out. And it morphed into harassment, then clear physical abuse. I had gotten used to emotional terror, but now that combined with threats of real violence. On the day it happened, I spent the last forty minutes of the day naked in the locker room as four classmates took turns beating me.

I ran to the bus stop in tears.

*Ashamed.*

*Hurt.*

And they ran after me.

When the bus came, Szandra and I got on—and the bullies piled in after us. They sat in the back, sending texts saying they would find out where I live.

Szandra saw my tears, the swelling developing on my face. I told her what happened. ""I'm afraid they'll never stop,"" I said.

That's when:

Szandra closed her eyes, humming—

The bus became a swamp, sunless, pervaded by a dull, illuminating fog of oppressive dread through which sprouted the black jagged branches of dead trees, on one of which:

Four flayed bodies swinging:

On the bus:

Silence pregnant with realization. Screaming of public transiters. Squealing of tires as the bus itself came skidding to a halt. And we all saw the four skinned bodies hanging impossibly from the ceiling of the bus. Dead, horrified.

Beside me. Szandra. Eyes open.

Heart. Beating.

*""They stop.""*

Szandra—the witch.

Szandra—my old friend."

When I returned home I  found an old walkie talkie. Just like the one I had as a child. A happy familiar voice came over the walkie. ""This is the price you pay. For hurting us Joe.""

""I never hurt anyone?""

""You and your generation did.""

""What? I don't understand. Just give me back my kids!""

""No. We need them to survive. We are fading, like a candle at it's wick end. It's all about survival now.""

""Let me talk to my sons. Geoffrey you owe me that.""

""Daddy.""

""Elliott! Y-you okay?""

""Yeah. Tony and I are okay. We've been having fun. Playing games and having pizza. It's so much fun here.""

""Elliott, you and Tony have to come home. You had no permission to leave. I'm not mad, I just want you two home.""

A static crackling came through the walkie talkie. Thinking of the long neck bastard who took my kids. When he spoke. 

""You took our joy and happiness away Joe. You caused our death. We are just taking the things you loved in return.""

""I don't know your friends. I barely know you! Give me back my kids. They should be home. With me, being safe at home and a family. Growing old together.""

My tears wouldn't stop dripping from my eyes. My frustrations, anger and fear reached a boiling point. ""Just. Just give me a chance to get them back. If you said we did this to you. We deserve a chance…"" I drop to my knees crying on my son's small bed. When his voice came over the walkie talkie.
""Elliott. You want to grow up and not be a kid anymore?""

I waited holding my breath. Waiting to hear my son's voice again. Staring at the walkie as if I could pull him out of it with my mind.

""But Dad…  I don't wanna grow up, I'm a Toys-R-Us kid. They got a million toys at Toys-R-Us that I can play with. I don't wanna grow up, I'm a Toys-R-Us kid. They got the best for so much less, you'll really flip your lid. From bikes to trains to video games. It's the biggest toy store their is. I don't wanna grow up, cause baby if I did. I couldn't be a Toys-R-Us kid."""

Sitting in my house, stirring my tea, wondering what the plan was for today.

Then I heard something hit the ground in my back garden.

I went out, inspecting what the hell happened. Whether something fell over, or if somebody lobbed a beer can over the wall.

But I wasn't expecting a skeleton.

One of a dead bird, the skin torn off with blood still remaining on the bones, and the meat on the inside strangely absent.

And then the first scream hit.

Tens in my neighbourhood, thousands in my city, millions across the world rang out with ear-piercing shrieks as their flesh was stripped and peeled from their body.

I collapsed to the ground, with a feeling as if every part of my corpse was being steamed with flaming hot irons.

First my skin, hanging off of my body in tears, as the cuts became longer and longer, flapping around as they clung onto what was left of me for dear life.

Then they collapsed, leaving just the meat on my bones.

The same poker sensation occured, as my organs and muscles dribbled through my bones and became liquefied.

It all collapsed, and when it was all said and done, I became one of the bloody bloody skeletons."

   One post broke the monotony. I stopped scrolling. ""Reply to this post or your mother will die in her sleep tonight."" I thought about replying, even if only to call the poster something unwholesome. Then, I remembered that I had immunity\_dog.jpg safely downloaded to my computer's desktop. That's a picture of a chubby dog with text overlaid on it stating that having the file saved will protect me from any such posts.

   Satisfied, I continued to scroll. Gradually, my eyes wandered from the posts, drawn to the manufacturer stickers that still clung to the corners of my new laptop.

   I stopped. I minimized my browser and felt my stomach grow tight as I realized my mistake. The file was on my old computer. I hadn't redownloaded immunity\_dog.jpg to this laptop. I had no protection. I bolted from the chair towards my bedroom door. ""Mom!""

""So you gonna wear something inappropriate? Cuz' a pig's face to a butcher is the right reflection."" St. Carmine spoke slowly to her granddaughter. She snacked on some dried cranberries as she tied on her own combat boots in the back of the van.

""Why does it matter?"" Credence loaded a clip into the left side of her C1M1 machinegun. She had painted it in pink camouflage and violet feathers. ""Dude won't be alive when this is over.""

""Its tradition, Childe."" St. Carmine spat. ""Out of the eater, something to eat.""

""Let's go give this boy a haircut then."" Credence had grown impatient. The mask was again offered. Finally she put on the pig's face. It smelled fetid and maggot casings were stuck to the fleshy parts. It just made her more eager to kill Hogman.

Three slayers were walking towards the creature out of the mist. Each had a rather large firearm: Tomps had a Mossberg auto shotgun and granny had a Desert Eagle.

They could see a cloud of its breath, its hollow eyes beheld them with malevolence. Hogman knelt over its latest victim, blood everywhere. Its bulk was a rancorous gut, filled with unchewed body parts and undigested organs as it ate people in bites and added them to the rotting stew in its guts. Seeing its hunters it stood on thick hoof-thorned trunks for legs. It let out a loud and nightmarish squeal of rage.

Fear and terror gripped the pig-killers as the tusked monstrosity bore down on them. In panic, Tomps dropped his weapon and ran, his pig mask coming free and falling to the ground. The other two held their ground as the beast with pink rippling skin charged at them.

""In the name of King Philip!"" St. Carmine exclaimed.

""And Charlotte's Web, too!"" Credence belted over the thunder of hoof-falls and squealing.

Then light and thunder spewed in flashing lead as spent shells tinkled merrily like Christmas bells. The wereboar danced to the rhythm and then stumbled on its two left feet. As it shook the ground the bullets poured into its skull and shattered its head.

Trembling and sweating they lifted their masks and stared at their handywork.

""We killed Hogman."" Credence was shaking, her nightmares were now as thin as the mist they stood in.

""There will be another. We are what we eat."" St. Carmine said with a mouthful of dried cranberries."

Duncan sat down on the crest of the plains and looked out towards the battered skyline. 

*What have we done to this place…?* 

The ***We*** was a plea to humanity. Right now, it was just about survival. Doing what they had to, in order to make it through each passing day. 

Duncan had done somethings he was not at all proud of. He shot a man over a can of Coca-Cola, his desperate urge to taste something reminiscent of normality outweighing his moral compunction to respect life. This was after the events of course… 

His life before the events was a dull and monotonous affair that didn’t involve any slaughter and pillaging. The event had changed humanity. And like the skylines descending over the earth, humanity also now had a purple poisoning deep inside of them.  

*Whatever it was that was descending upon our natural world was descending upon ourselves.* 

Duncan turned back towards the others. His gun was slung over his shoulder, his cleaver was in the other hand and his face was caked in blood which was now drying and crusting over. 

Duncan had done many things that he wasn’t proud of. And not all of them were in the name of survival. Some of it was for greed, some of it was to *fit in* to this new world and some of it, was just because it was there to be done. And Duncan had dealt with the weight of these actions in a pragmatic and apathetic nature. Not that he was a pragmatic and apathetic person. It was just to avoid dwelling on the past and himself. 

But of all the things that Duncan had done, this was by far the worst. The absolute worst. And despite all of the humanity he had lost, he not lost enough to dwell on this moment right now and to dwell on it forever more. 

The fire rose up in a flame and Duncan felt the extreme heat from the barbeque. He grabbed himself a plate and walked towards his hunting party. 

Kevin held out a plate of finely cut meat sliced against the bloody bone. 

Duncan stared down as the blood oozed from the loin. 

“This one is nice. I think it was that child. Really tender.” Kevin said, offering the meat to Duncan. 

Duncan had done somethings he was not proud of. But this was the absolute worst. He grabbed a fork, stuck it in the meat and shovelled it into his face. 

*But it tasted so so so good.* 

“Could be another four days before we eat again.” Kevin said and slapped Duncan on the back. 

*I think it was that child.* 

*I think it was that child.* 

*I think it was that child.* 

The words hung in the air; tormenting Duncan."

For weeks, we tolerated the intense whimpering and writhing in his bassinet. The bags under my eyes sank heavy as if summoned by the vast, unnamed gods below. *Please, allow me one good night’s rest.* When I couldn’t take it anymore, she took the reins and consoled him. My wife would light scented candles and coo above him, her favorite old leather-bound book in hand. The baby mobile I constructed out of twigs, raven feathers, and jimson weed must have helped too.

\*\*\*

“Good-morning-my-precious-little-birdie,” I singsonged to him. I set my coffee mug down on the table and leaned forward, hands on my knees. “Will you finally say your first word, baby boy?” Roland sat back with an aimless stare, still drowsy as daybreak loomed. We sat him upright in the chair I made from the black maple out back, planted so many moons ago. *Time, where does it go?* In Anoka, this question proved difficult to answer.

Yawning, my wife held our baby close and attempted a kiss atop his head. He squirmed out of her embrace, wrinkling his nose and squinting his cold, green marbles for eyes. His knotted mouth twitched back and forth. A silent, threatening tantrum that ended in a rigid, warped smile. She muttered some curses and jerked away to read a subsection of The Book, audible tension in her words. After a moment of regaining her composure, she turned back to us.

“Please, please, please,” whispered my beautiful wife, silver roots peeking out from under her brunette dye. She set The Book back down, crossed her fingers, and bit her lip. I, too, hoped Roland’s first words would be the *right* words.

I pushed up his greasy, wiry hair to sit with the rest, thus revealing the swirled birthmark on his forehead. It pulsated and glowed a faint green. With pruning shears, I cut away at the gnarled baby roots which kept his jaw shut, his voice imprisoned. A high-pitched squeal emitted from deep inside his throat. It was ear-piercing, not dissimilar to a mandrake violently uprooted beneath a full moon. My wife dropped The Book and we both covered our ears. The screeching ceased.

“Da-Dada,” he said, lush soil spilling from his tiny, bleeding teeth. My wife retreated into herself, defeat flooding her face. She swiveled to me, sobbing. I let out a deep sigh as my wife sank deeper into me.

“I’m so sorry, turtledove. I thought he’d be the one. I’ll grab the shovel,” I said to coat her despair in some feigned warmth. “Back into the ground.”"

In school, I was always told that I had a face *”only a mother could love”*. They’d all pity me - *”brains but no beauty”* they’d say. But as I grew older, that all changed. I guess puberty had other plans for me. Everyone was so shocked, even my own mother and father. No one could believe that the ugly duckling had blossomed into a swan. 

But I never believed it. I could never *see* it, you understand. All I saw was a grotesque specimen; a face so disgusting and misshapen. A face that deserved to be hidden from away society. Each time I’d glance in the mirror, I failed to see what everyone else saw. All I perceived were my own shortcomings; my own inadequacies. I convinced myself that I had a face that not even a mother *could* love. 

If I didn’t love myself, how could I expect anyone else to? 

Things only got worse after I started seeing *her*. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen; a face so defined and delicate - like that of a porcelain doll. Her hair fell about her elegant shoulders like a picturesque waterfall. She was everything that I wasn’t and she made sure I knew that *every single day*. 

I’d see her every morning and every night, in the mirror. 

*”You’re ugly”*, she’d tell me. 

*”You’re worthless”*, she’d sneer. 

And with each passing day, I believed her more and more. She had wormed her way into my mind; had burrowed herself deep inside my subconscious with her barrage of hate and loathing. One night, she began telling me to stab myself in the face; she told me I had to fix what was broken. She told me that was my only way out; my salvation was the edge of a knife. 

*”Don’t you want to be beautiful?”* She’d ask. 

*”Don’t you want to be loved?”* Her eyes would sparkle like two bright diamonds as she’d present the knife to me. 

*”Yes”*, I said. 

*”Then you know what you have to do.”* 

I nodded as I caressed the blade; the cool steel chilled my fingers as I felt the tears warm my cheeks. I lifted the knife to my face and I sliced; I carved until all I could see was blood. My vision was crimson but I could still see her beautiful face and she was smiling. I smiled back as I pushed the knife deeper into my flesh; the sound of wet meat filled my ears. 

The knife fell, clattering on the floor. I looked up and marvelled at my face; I had done it. It was perfect; like an ice sculpture whose imperfections had been chiseled away. I touched my moistened cheeks; the blood stuck to my fingers as I caressed the nerve endings and the pink fleshy tendrils. I smiled and closed my eyes. I was finally...perfect. 

All I ever wanted was to be beautiful and now I was."

Everything had gone off so far without a hitch. The man, dressed in black with a stereotypical ski mask covering his more easily recognizable features, was inches from his goal. Literally. The vault stood open before him, as he knew it would. He'd been here before, almost a thousand times, perfecting his plan as he went.

He knew exactly how much time he had to enter the bank, get the tellers to open the vault, and escape before the police inevitably showed up, because for some unknown reason, he had the good fortune (or misfortune, depending on how you looked at it) to be reliving this exact moment in history, over and over again. At this point he was growing desperate, trying to find a way out, but he figured why not have some fun as well?

He stuffed as much as he could into the again stereotypical duffel bag, and made his way to the front door. Before he was halfway across the lobby, however, the unmistakable blue and red lights began to flash outside. He must have taken too long opening the vault again. 

He decided to take one of the unfortunate tellers hostage in hopes of escaping successfully. After some heated arguments with the man who claimed to be in charge, one Detective Barnes (who by the way seemed to be a new occurrence in this particular loop), and getting nowhere, the man decided to try again. He shot himself to reset the loop.

There was once a wealthy but kind Squireen (Squire in Gaelic) who lived in a huge Castle or Mansion along with his three young, beautiful daughters Fiadh, Kira and Niamh. Their beloved Mother had passed away five years back.


It was a dark, cold, stormy Christmas Eve night when the Devil paid Squireen Roche a visit.


The Squireen invited the Devil to dine with them, and the Devil did.


The Squireen invited the Devil to play cards with them, and the Devil did.


The Devil being the Devil and a crafty, conniving and wretched creature made a wager with the old Squireen.


Now, the Devil had taken quite a shine to Squireen Roche's youngest daughter and wanted her for himself.


The Devil told the Squireen he would play cards with him, but if he won three rounds then the radiant fair Niamh would be his forever and he would dance her back to hell to live as his bride for all eternity.


The Squireen felt obliged to agree {I mean who turns down the Devil?)


The Devil being the Devil cheated at cards and so thought he had tricked himself ínto getting a beautiful young innocent bride to corrupt.


The Devil underestimated Niamh though; for Niamh means ""Bright"" in Gaelic and Niamh certainly lived up to her name.


She did not want to be the Devil's wife, and so along with her two sisters hatched a most devious plan that would put the Devil himself to shame.


They filled up a beautiful red silk bag with salt and Niamh hung it around her slender neck, 


When the Devil came to claim Niamh they began to dance, but we all know that Demons can not tolerate salt at any cost, it is like poison to them, and the Devil is the King of Demons.


On noticing the beautiful bag the Devil's curiosity and greed got the better of him and he tore it off the fair clever maiden's neck, ripping the bag open he gazed upon the pure white salt and with an awful part wail part growl he fled the old Squireen's Castle or Mansion and scurried all the way back to Hell leaving the family to enjoy the festivities, of the season in peace and tranquillity as they deserved.

Amongst chicken farmers its common knowledge that any weaker individuals will be weeded out, pecked to death by the greater mass of the rest of the flock. Presumably that behaviour can explain how these incidents have occurred. Whilst feeding, or checking on the general health of the flock, the worker must have tripped, fell over and surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of birds, he was also pecked to death. His eyes were missing, in fact most of his face had been pecked clean off his skull.

8 guppies

I bought 2 little suckerfish to eat the algae and a fake anemone for decoration.

The joy of watching those suckerfish run around so fast and through the anemone!

I I loved having a little ecosystem in my hands!

Then the guppies started having babies so many babies too many babies so I got tiny sharks to even the odds out

The next morning I had woken up and checked my fish the little babies were lower in numbers and the sharks got along with the suckerfish! What fun!

Then the hybrids came.

Suckerfish sharks they had the speed of the suckerfish and the hunger of the sharks! and they where bigger?

Months later everything was bigger! They evolved so fast! Adding new fish was amazing soon i had made my basement into a giant ecosystem!

The sharks where the size of cats. the guppies like giant rats.

Could I breed them with non aquatic species?
 
I set an island in the middle of the aquarium filled it with lizards

The next morning I went downstairs to find lizard sharks 

They evolved so fast!""

""Well those new preditors were so strong they were killing everything else! And I thought that little mermaids would be so *interesting*"""

\~ \~ \~

The clearing is quiet, the air heavy with last night's dew. The morning Sun peers above the trees, bringing with it the golden promise of a productive day. 

\~ \~ \~

It is a dangerous life we lead on the edges of the forest, chasing the open spaces left by fire or flood. We die every day to disease, thirst and wild beasts – but They are different. They don't eat us, They *take* us. 

Their weapons - great, monstrous crescents - have a waxy appearance, save for the edges of the blade which glisten eerily. 

Towering so high they block out the golden Sun, they walk among us and carefully, gently, examine us, looking for the strong and healthy. Once chosen, it takes merely a single swing of a waxy blade to end our life.

Having killed all they can carry, they withdraw. They may not be seen again for a season. Or They may return tomorrow.

\~ \~ \~

Today is my day to be taken. I have grown tall and strong. I am found quickly. A large thumb brushes over my head then lets me go. For a moment it seems They will move on. 

That hope was misplaced. 

A single stroke with the waxy blade and it is over. They toss me into a basket and I land roughly on the bodies of my dying kin, but I am not gone yet.

The Sun has risen fully and the clearing glows in a happy, yellow light that belies the horror that has occurred. I am carried from the clearing and for the first time experience the shade of the trees and the cool air of the forest. 

Unable to see the sky and slowly dying, I lose track of time. 

\~ \~ \~

Perhaps a half day later, perhaps mere moments, the basket is dropped. Beside us is a towering column of rock. A giant hand lifts a dozen of my kin onto the rock. The crunch of my breaking bodies follows. 

The hand returns to the basket and I am taken. The crunching-tool looms overhead: two wooden rods, linked by a cord. Simple. Destructive.

Bodies lie all around, shattered and lifeless. Some slide from the rock and land in the dirt to rot and decay…

And bring new life. Green shoots poke up from between the bodies of their ancestors. Still small, but obviously strong. These youngsters will grow to have large, full seeds, the kind They like to harvest.

Yet this does not seem deliberate. The area around the rock has been cleared of vegetation and trampled flat. Seeds must have fallen from the rock, unseen by Them, and here in the very heart of danger, the young ones awoke, took root and are flourishing.

By only taking the strongest of us, only the strongest grow here. They are making us stronger and do not even realise it. 

Maybe we can benefit from this arrangement."

He was whistling softly to the song which was being played on the late night radio show. It was a warm summer night, engulfed in an eerie silence. Liam had been driving for the past 30 minutes looking for a hotel to stay overnight, but in vain. Just a few more miles in, an the engine sputtered with a hissing sound, slowing the car down. It came to a gradual stop, as the car bonnet released copious amount of smoke from within.

 Breaking down in the middle of nowhere was the last thing Liam wanted now. He held on to his nerves and started looking around for help. His eyes fell on a barnyard, a few hundred metres ahead, off the main road. He started walking towards it, hoping to find someone to help. As he reached the barn, he found that it was  completely desolated. Running out of any viable options, he decided to spend the night in the barn and try seeking help in the morning. The surroundings were quite dark, with the only source of illumination being the moon. Liam rested on a group of hay bales lying on the barn floor and went to sleep. 

His sleep was disturbed by what sounded like cackling laughter coming from the outside. Liam woke up with haste and started walking towards the direction from where the sound was coming. He came out of the barn and saw a well few metres away. The sound seemed to be coming from the well. Liam walked towards it and peeped into the well. It was too dark to see anything properly, and all he could make out in the dark was his own blurry reflection in it. On finding nothing, he went back into the barn and went to sleep without thinking much about it. 

He woke up startled as he heard a rooster's crowing, to realise that it was morning already. He got out of his makeshift bed, and exited the barn, satisfied with the sound sleep that he had there. On his way out, his eyes fell on the well that he saw the previous night. Still curious about the weird sound that came from it the day before, he decided to check it again. He approached the well and peeked into it. Liam felt as if he was hit by a thunderous bolt. He felt his knees getting weak and his palms sweaty as the images from the previous night started flashing in front of his eyes. The very memory of watching his blurry reflection in the well, left him extremely disturbed as he dumbfoundedly gazed at the parched floor of the well!!!"

I closed them without paying much attention, briefly glimpsing 'find local housewives' as it disappeared. I managed to close all but one. I clicked multiple times but I couldn’t seem to close or even minimise it.

I looked closely at the screen. 'Discover your true soulmate'. An icon of a cartoon treasure chest sat just below the text. I clicked on it, hoping it would just trigger the next ad and let me continue watching Euphoria in peace.

Instead, a file started downloading onto my laptop. Soulmate.MP4. I tried to cancel the download multiple times, but it only took a few seconds.

The video played automatically.

By the time I woke up, it felt as though my whole life had changed. I had finally seen the face of my soulmate. I felt truly whole for the first time in my life.

I tried to tell my friends what I had discovered but they just laughed it off. At least at first. Then the envy set in and they told me I was wrong, that they were “worried about me”. I tried to explain it to them but it quickly became clear they weren’t willing to listen.

James obviously didn’t understand either. If he had, he wouldn't have kept calling me. Honestly, he wasn’t a bad person. He just wasn’t my soulmate.

My parents started calling me more and more too. I didn’t mean to ignore them, it’s just hard to focus on anything else when you’re so in love. Eventually they just turned up outside my dorm. Said they had been contacted by my school multiple times about attendance. I tried to explain to them that I didn’t need anything else anymore, but I could see even then that they didn’t take me seriously.

It’s not so bad living here. My parents cried when they first dropped me off but I told them it would be okay. It makes almost no difference to me. I already have everything I need.

I do get irritated during the group sessions though. I just want to be left alone. I spend the whole day looking forward to the evening, when I can go back to my room.

They don’t let us have mirrors of course, but I’ve learned to improvise. I stand in front of the window. It’s not the perfect reflection but it’s better than nothing.

“I’ve missed you my love” I say with a smile.

He cursed the weather app on his phone, battery now dead from the cold, for telling me it would be light flurries at worst. His tent had caved under the snow, and it took him much longer than he wanted to pack up camp and turn around. 


It didn’t take him long at all to get lost. Everything around him was a blank, white sheet. 


Greg swore again, out loud this time, and set up camp for another night, curling up in a ball and shivering. 


He woke up to a figure standing outside his tent door. He sighed with relief on realizing it was just a snowman, but wondered who had set one up in the night? The blizzard had covered any tracks around the tent, so he couldn’t even tell which direction they had gone. 


After following his compass for another day, Greg was forced to set up camp for a third night, wondering how he would explain this to his boss.


This time there was more than one snowman, five, to be precise. The snow had lessened, but Greg could still not find any tracks around his tent, not even his own. He forced himself to remain calm, as nothing productive would come from panicking. 


He let himself feel fear later that night when he had to set up camp again, this time keeping watch to see who was messing with him in the woods. 


Greg didn’t fall asleep, but when the sun rose, he noticed an uncountable number of figures sounding his tent. All were snowmen, no tracks around the tent, and they seemed to stretch for miles. 


Panic took over. Greg kicked at one of the snowmen, screaming and swearing. The figures had frozen more overnight, so the snowmen did not budge. Angrily, Greg brought his axe out, and slashed off one of their heads. 


He screamed again when blood splattered over the snow. 


The snowmen around him screeched, and began to shuffle through the snow toward him. Greg shivered, and held his axe defensively, but stick like arms reached up from the headless snowman to hold him in place. The snowmen began to throw snow at Greg, some of them rushing forward and hitting him with it. He felt his body temperature decrease, unable to even scream for help and a snowman forced snow into his open mouth. He died with a feeling of warmth, despite his skin turning black from frostbite. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The authorities were baffled. They found the missing person deceased, but with no motive as to what killed him.


The man, Greg, had been dismembered, his arms sticking out of one giant snowball, legs jutting out from the lower one, resembling a grotesque snowman. His head, cheeks red and lips blue, sat atop the figure, a frozen scream stuck to his face."

Much of what we do is listen for radio communications for alien civilizations. Yesterday we received our first and possibly last communication from aliens.

The way the message was sent was weird. The signal's origin was not in our galaxy, or even in the local group. This means that the signal must have been insanely powerful to reach us. The second weird thing was that only an area of a few miles around the radio telescope picked up the signal. That means that not only was the signal incredibly focused, only diverging a few fractions of a degree across millions of light years, but that the senders knew exactly where we were.

The contents of the message was the same in nearly a thousand languages. It read ""Quiet your radio communications. The Other can hear you.""

I never really believed in ghosts until I went there, just as you go in the mood just drastically changes. There were these huge holes in the ground and it was pretty late at night so we had to watch where we were stepping because we could easily fall into one of the holes. We then went downstairs and our tour guide started taking pictures of us, he kept checking the camera, I told my dad he's just editing the photos so it would seem like there's a ghost behind us. But what I didn't know was that my uncle was taking pictures. My uncle has a really old phone so it was impossible to edit on there. Once we got out of the hospital we walked towards Mcdonalds and my uncle was still taking pictures.

We got back to our aunt's house my mom looked strangely at me and asked if I saw anything, obviously I said no because I thought the whole thing was fake.

No wonder, really, as I picked the colors and furnishings to my preferences and even forbid my wife and kids to enter in if they see the doors closed. Even the random guests visiting us have learned over the time that when I'm in my office, it's like I'm not home at all. 

I just hate it when someone is looking at me while I'm working or reading. It's because sometimes I make those breaks to just walk from one corner of the room to another, pretending that I'm talking to someone or imagining the (im)possible scenarios with people living as well as the fantasied ones. 

And when I do that, it involves grimaces and gestures of all kinds along with the muffled laughs, humming and random words being said out loud. It would make my family think that I'm mentally sick to see me doing such, while in fact it's just my way to cope with the stress. Not that I have to worry that much about being seen anymore - the kids are gone on their studies and my wife is staying with her new lover. Though I still keep the doors closed. 

Habits don't die easily. 

So I'm about to turn the page in a current book while humming my favourite song, when I accidentally push the frame with a photo of my wife from the desk, causing the glass covering it to break into thousands of pieces.

And that's when I notice it. 

A long shadow standing in the open doors. 

It takes mere seconds for me to picture a woman-like person. She instantly takes a swift turn away and I can hear the sound of her boots stomping the floor. She's running away and I know, that I need to catch her, so I bolt from my place. 

She was most likely watching me for some time. How dare of her! Now I can see her back, as she's nearing to the end of a long corridor, where the stairs are. She's pretty fast for a tiny woman, but I'm not the slowest one as well. It shouldn't be a problem for me to catch up with the intruder. 

All I want to do is to pull her back as she descents the staircase. Then I crush her beautiful little skull. 

She has to pay for watching me. 

Unfortunately, her short hair slips out of my hand and she jumps the last couple of stairs. The entrance doors are wide open, so she runs outside the house to a man, who's holding a cardboard box next to the car. 

She then shouts at him, terrified:

""Honey, we should rethink the purchase of this house. It's haunted as fuck!"""

This Magician stood at the stage, with his ravishing assistant Rhiannon, and he marvelled at the faces of the stunned children and teens. It never ceased to amaze him that after all of these years; he still had the power to *wow*.

Rhiannon jumped inside the crate. The Magician put a saw through the middle of the box and split the box into two. He put Rhiannon inside one of those cages you get at the zoo, threw a sheet over the cage, then pulled the sheet back and Rhiannon vanished. The Magician then reversed the trick and Rhiannon was back. The Magician was an artist. The crowd yelled and cheered.

“Thank you… thank you…” The Magician said.

The Magician was also a local man named Lawrence. He ran a local butcher shop. He volunteered within the community. He didn’t have children himself and he lived in a big house on Bunker Avenue – the house had six bedrooms and its own wine cellar. Five to six times a year Lawrence painted his face white, wore a purple robe, hired a local girl from the newspaper (or online as the times move) and performed for all the kiddies in the area. Lawrence was likeable, generous with his time and kind… People in the community trusted Lawrence…. They trusted Lawrence and loved the Magician.

After the show people thanked Lawrence personally and complimented the Magician. It took Lawrence a whole to differentiate between the two after the show. He hugged all the kids and they all adored the Magician.

After that, he was back to being *just* Lawrence again.

Plain old boring Lawrence.

But Lawrence could still conjure up his own magic tricks.

Rhiannon sat on the sofa with a margarita and complimented Lawrence on his *big big house.* She had those innocent, hungry eyes that the girls sometimes get. Lawrence snuck up behind her with his ‘magic’ saw. He’d slipped back into that purple robe and put the black eyeliner over his eyelids. This performance didn’t have an audience...

Lawrence’s first magic trick was the sleeping spell, it was cast in the margarita. It wasn’t magic of course, it was sleight of hand (and twenty five crushed lithium pills). The next magic trick was sawing in half, except it wasn’t in half, it was in about twenty seven separate pieces. And then there was making the girl disappear. That would involve quicklime and concrete. But the *real* magic was convincing the agency that the girl simply never turned up and probably ran off somewhere else to find a new job…

The Magician was loved by the community for his sleight of hand and false conjuring. But it was Lawrence that really made people disappear, twenty seven of them so far… Twenty eight after Rhiannon…"

They sprouted like weeds from our lawn a while ago. Tiny at first of course; mere spongy placenta shoots to begin with, their thick slimy fungal forms expanding at an alarming rate the days that followed.

“Have you seen the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**?” I asked my wife.

“Yes, I have seen the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**,” she replied.

I nodded in disbelief. Had she *really* seen the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**? If she had, wouldn’t she have informed me of such a bizarre encounter? Wouldn’t she then say *husband, have you seen the* **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**?

Could it be that the absurdity of their existence somehow dulled her mind? Or, more plausibly in fact; did the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS** corrupt her somehow, denying my wife access to her very own senses? Fungi do not possess nerve cells you know. I’m not altogether sure if that strengthens my theory, or weakens it.

In any case, she quickly became quite obsessed with them after we’d both declared our knowledge of their existence. She’d sit out in the creeping cold for hours, stroking the strange alien texture of the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS** idly, her mouth vibrating almost unnoticeably, like she was mumbling fungal bedtime stories them.

Every other day she’d violently rip one from the ground, bring it to the kitchen, and fry it up in the pan. A thick fluid would seep from her mouth as she ravenously chomped down on the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOM**, and from time to time I’d be forced to remind her that it looked an awful lot like

“Blood?” she asks?

“My, My, Mycelium, yes, it does,” I answer.

“All life under the sun is fueled by vitae, husband,” she notes, blood and placenta bits dripping down into a fine puddle on the concrete floor. “And all life has a purpose.”

I rattle my chains weakly, the insufferable pain reaching levels threatening my own sanity. “And what, pray tell, is my purpose in this life, dear?” I ask.

She chuckles heartily. “You are a father, my love. Your mission is to birth as many as you can, before succumbing to the beautiful cannibalization of self.”

She grabs a **SPONGY PLACENTA** offshoot growing from the wound in my abdomen, and laughs as my tormented screams echo through our basement.

“I will check on you later, husband,” she whispers in my ear. “You and our children.”

And so here I lie, hidden from the sun, waiting to be devoured by the slime of the dark. My wife comes down every other week now, cutting from my exposed necrotic wounds the fungal sprouts of newborn **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**. Sometimes she will eat them right off my body, and for a moment I will feel a connection, a semblance of peace, as our symbiotic souls, invisible mycelium threads, entangle briefly.

The next door neighbour walking across the wooden floor, coming nearer. The next door neighbour's child crying. The next door neighbour's dog howling. The next door neighbour talks to the dog and you know she is holding its collar and asking it to move, its claws scrape softly on the wooden floor.

You turn over to try to sleep, only to realise that you're not at home. You're camping, alone in a tent, in a grassy field, in the middle of nowhere.

You sit up. You hear it again.

The noise of someone walking on wooden floors, with a howling child and a dogs claws scraping the floor, coming nearer. 

Coming much, much nearer. Not so familiar and comforting now."

1: A large green tree located in earth #8261
2: Chanting the word 'mailman bird' three times in a row then jumping precisely 5.7 cm in 4 seconds.
3: Slaying either a screecher or smiler in its counterpart dimension, earth #1835 (also known as The Backrooms).

Earth #1836 is recognisable by its dull yellow skies, and the presence of either a viral outbreak or constant nuclear war. It has numerous deviations, the most prominent being the so called 'ghost effect'. At exactly 5.30 p.m. every day, all resident entities will lose their memories and gain them back at 5.30 a.m. the next day.

Earth #1836 has no resident entities, but is instead populated with creatures leaked from earth #1835, including but not limited to screechers, smilers and humans in an average ratio of 2:1:3 respectively. Humans are mostly friendly here, but contact is not recommended due to a recent influx of various shape shifters.

When visiting #1836, it is recommended to wear at least a class 5 biohazard suit due to the chance of a viral outbreak happening. In the case of a nuclear war instead of a viral outbreak, an emergency outpost has been established at 37.243 degrees North, 115.7930 degrees West.

Due to an abundance of hostile entities on earth #1836, only staff with level 6 clearance and above should be allowed to enter. Any other visitors would be unqualified to survive the minimum seven days on earth #1863, and should be detained immediately if found here.

To be, or to not to be. This can be thought of as an overused wording to most people. For me, I still see the beauty in the words. So, to be or to not to be? There’s sick irony in that saying, to be or to not be. What is better life or death? What is better living in mental anguish or feeling nothing? What is more frightening than the known or unknown. 

It all started when the suicide rates skyrocketed. Then the manslaughters started, then the overdose. Pretty soon it seemed like everyone either wanted to kill themselves or someone else. 

Psychologist blamed society 

Scientist blamed climate change 

Politician blamed each other 

When there was no one left blame that when they stated the separation.

You were either deemed fit or unfit. The unfit were the emotional type, quick to anger, quick to evoke, quick to show in unrestraint with emotion …. Unfortunately, they were also quick to love. The quick to show empathy or understanding. 

The ones deemed fit showed no emotion at all. Marred by the fact that showing any emotion will either get you set to maintaining or executed."

Yastrinski stood over his classmate with a revolver in his trembling hand. 

“I told you to stop.” Yastrinski said. His voice matched his hands. 

Carter was on his knees sobbing. “Please, please.” He said through clenched teeth. 

Yastrinski raised the gun and pointed it at the kid who tormented him for years. He opened the cylinder and checked to see if the bullets were still there. 

They were.

“I told you to stop but you didn’t. This is your fault. You did this. This was you. This was you.” Yastrinski said. All the veins in his arms were popped out as he held the gun with a death grip. 

Carters sobs and begs for mercy were all but ignored as Yastrinksi pulled back the hammer to his Smith & Wesson double action. He closed his eyes, then turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger. Yastrinski fell over and a splatter of blood covered Carters face. 

Carter sat there for a moment in utter shock then looked down at the floor where Yastrinski lay dead. He then screamed in terror but was not heard over the whistle of the wind."

I knew that wrinkly skin sack had it in for my kids since day one. Judging by her Karen haircut and scowl that can spoil a ripe apple, she definitely did not approve of the way I was raising my kids.

More than once, I had to pick Ajay up from the principle's office. Shirley had sent him home because she deemed his Battlefield T-shirt ""obscene"" and ""gory"". My son was in tears each time I ran to comfort and assure him he did nothing wrong.

Delilah and I decided to invite Shirley over for dinner, hopefully to show that rotten woman that video games are harmless to our kids. Surprisingly enough, Shirley accepted.

The moment she stepped through my door, she began searching for any sign of unpleasant game-related business. Soon enough, she spotted my big Resident Evil poster.

""That game is full of gore and bloodshed, exposing your kids to this kind of media will desensitize them."" She commented, mouth pressed thin.

My boys were not happy with Shirley's visit, but they were well-behaved nonetheless. Over dinner, we happily discussed the new Call of Duty game, talked about how cool the new Far Cry trailer looked, and what shenanigans we're getting up to once Cyberpunk 2077 gets released. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get an ounce of pleasure out of watching Shirley squirm in her seat. Even Delilah seemed to enjoy this.

After dinner, Shirley took a tour of our home, scorned at my wife's collection of Overwatch heroes, and rolled her eyes when Adam and Ajay chatted with their their Destiny fireteam. She might as well have fainted when she passed by their DOOM poster.

Finally, we got to our little daughter's room. Inside, Emily is happily stacking LEGO figures together and humming to herself. I see a faint smile break out of Shirley's face.

""That's how children should be."" She commented matter-of-factly, ""Without all the noise and buzz of video games.""

Emily turns to give Shirley a sweet smile, right as I kick her in the back and send her tumbling into the room. Before Shirley could scramble to her feet, I shut the door behind her.

A series of growls and snarls erupted from behind the door, Shirley's choked cry of horror, a *crunch* and a *snap* slowly fading to the elastic ripping of flesh from sinew. Then I hear Emily's little baby teeth grating on the bone.

I open the door to what's left of Shirley. Half of Emily's face was a crimson mess, her head buried in the woman's chest cavity and searching greedily.

""See?"" I raise my eyebrow at Shirley, who certainly cannot see the look on my face now, ""Video games don't cause violence."""

I think the latter. I had strange urges growing up. Of what I wanted to do to women, teachers, classmates. Unspeakable things. WRONG things.


But I always knew that was WRONG, so I never succumbed to temptation. 


Sally was my next door neighbor, and childhood best friend. We had walked, and later driven, to school together since we were five. 


Everyday, for over a decade, I resisted those urges, and fought back. I never let the WRONGNESS take over. I could push Sally down this upcoming hill, or miss our next turn and drive to a secluded location, or sneak in her house before her parents got home. 


Oh, I wanted to, so badly.


But that was WRONG, so I never succumbed to temptation. 


Even after Sally and I drifted apart, I still thought of her. Oh, there were other women I wanted to be WRONG with, but one always remembers their first right? I felt disappointed when I heard she was arrested for assault and battery at 32. She must have had some WRONGNESS just like me, but was unable to resist that sweet temptation. She was killed by a rival prison gang at 45. 


WRONGNESS indeed.


Suffice to say, I resisted those urges my whole life. I ignored the WRONGNESS for 52 years, never hurting a single soul in the way I desperately wanted to, before a heart attack took me to the grave.


At first when I woke up in the house, I was confused. I heard crying down the hall, and opened the door to find Sally weeping. I looked in a mirror and noticed we were both teenagers again. Young. This couldn’t be real. 


Yet it was, I still felt, thought, got hungry, needed to use the bathroom. Everything was as it was when we were alive and in high school, except it was just the two of us, inside her old house surrounded by a white void. 


The WRONGNESS was still there, and for the first few days, I held out again. Then Sally asked me something that changed everything. 


“Is this my Heaven?”


It clicked for me. “No.” 


I grinned, and let the WRONGNESS take over for the first time.


I let the WRONGNESS have control everyday after that also. It’s not like she could go anywhere, tell anyone. 


We’ve been here hundreds of years, yet we’ve never aged a day. We wake up perfectly healthy, no matter what WRONGNESS happens. Sally cries everyday, complaining that she’s tired. 


“Too bad.” I grin, as she chokes down a hopeless sob. 


In life, Sally didn’t resist her WRONGNESS, but I did. I went 52 years of fighting the WRONGNESS at every step, making sure I never hurt anyone.


But this isn’t life, this is the afterlife. It’s my reward for pushing the WRONGNESS back for so long.


Sally may be in Hell.


But I’m in Heaven."

She was fifteen years old when we found out she was dying. 

&#x200B;

All of the prayers had fallen short and the medical staff had been unsuccessful in healing my sister. By then I was ready to do anything. 

&#x200B;

Most people probably see a deal with a demon as negative. But sometimes you just need to get results. Summoning one is easy enough, there are endless ways to do it, and all are as simple as opening yourself to contact with one. While the rest of my family was with Tess in the hospital, I prepared. I closed all the curtains. I drew a pentagram on my floor and lit candles around it. 

&#x200B;

It was there before I realized, a shadow that had grown to overtake the entire room. My whole body was quaking in Its presence. My teeth chattered so hard that I thought they might break. Its voice came from my own mouth, so deep and loud that it shook the house.

&#x200B;

“You have called, my servant. I know what you seek. A promise in blood shall set my work in motion.”

I raised the knife to my palm, letting the blood fall in the center of the circle.

It had been hard to be constantly overshadowed by my younger sister. Jealousy had consumed my soul, turning it black and rotting me from the inside out. 

&#x200B;

The first time I called on It, I asked for Tess to be taken from this world. The demon wasted no time. Within hours she was rushed to the hospital, where she had remained ever since.

As Death closed in on her, I knew what had to be done. Guilt finally overtook my fear, I couldn’t let her die. This time I had asked It to trade places, to take the terminal disease from her body and transfer it to mine.

Rumors abounded throughout our extended family, but they were just whispers in dark corners. It was no real secret that she kept different hours than us, never shared in our meals, and didn’t often partake in family outings. Since I grew up with these habits, they weren’t strange to me. I loved my mom and generally wrote her behavior off as shyness or embarrassment at our habits. We can be a rowdy lot at mealtimes, full of crass jokes and poor table manners. My father was good with it, so I figured it was okay. 

As I grew older, I understood that some people were introverts and this label seemed to fit her like a glove. She was never comfortable at parties, though my father insisted on them.  We had at least one family over every month, when our countless aunts and uncles, grandparents, and great-grandparents weren’t visiting. I come from a long line of social people, so I suppose my mother’s behavior was odd when considered with the rest. 

It wasn’t until one of our monthly dinner parties, a couple weeks ago, that it hit me. My father had invited the Johnson’s, a family of five from the Lower East side. The parental unit was typical for the area and the husband shared my father’s sense of rude wit. The kids were pleasant enough, I suppose. We had little in common, but it wasn’t of much concern. I’ve learned to get along with all types and can make small talk like a pro. The mother was obviously very affectionate and concerned for her children’s well-being.  She embraced them tightly and was very passionate in expressing her feelings about them. It was very hard for my siblings and I to get them away from her, as they practically clung to her side.

Mother was present through the entire event, at the insistence of my father. *You’re part of this family, Clarissa, so you should participate,* I had overheard him tell her, through the kitchen door. She was practically in tears, but she came out and stood by the doorway, avoiding the glances of our guests. 

She must have been pretending she couldn’t hear them because she didn’t respond when they addressed her, loudly, on multiple occasions. *Call the police!* they would say. *They can’t have our children!* they would claim. And of course, like all their predecessors, they inevitably called out, *Help! Somebody please help us!*

Then, for one split second, my mother glanced up and locked eyes with the other mother. I saw in her expression something it’s taken weeks of research and discovery for me to comprehend, as I’ve had no experience with this in my life: pity and remorse.  Then, unable to handle the carnage one second longer, she disappeared back into the kitchen.

How had I not noticed she was human?"
k7awee,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k7awee/collin_gross_never_showered/,Collin Gross never showered,39,4,1607187125.0,"Collin Gross, was always a weird kid.

His last name definitely measured up to his mannerisms. He would pick his nose and eat the boogers in class, he put ketchup in his chocolate milk, and would always make those obnoxious elbow farts during class. 

All the boys in the class used to laugh at what he did although it was more towards him and not with him. All the girls in the class tried to keep at least 20 feet of distance from him at all times. 

However, the worst part of it all was that Collin Gross stunk. The kid never showered and always smelled like a sweaty gym sock. Kids used to plug their nose as they walked past him, sometimes as a joke but sometimes out of necessity.

In fact, the smell got so bad that our teacher had to pull him aside a few times and give him lectures about personal hygiene. I think she even tried to call his parents a few times, but clearly that didn’t work.

One day at lunch, a group of boys decided to go tease Collin a bit, as usual. 

“Phew, Collin, you stink today,” remarked one of them.

He jokingly plugged his nose as he sat down by him.

Now normally this would cause a kid to be a little self conscious, but that didn’t work on Collin. With a grin as he poured ketchup into his milk he answered. 

“Why thank you.”

“Do you ever even shower?,” asked one of the guys.

Collin stopped smiling and shook his head.

“Can’t shower,” he simply replied.

“Why not?”

“Cause when I go in, this creepy face is watching me.” 

“Hey you guys here that? Collin can’t shower cause he’s worried a ghost will get him.”

The group of boys started laughing and poking at Collin.

“I’m telling you it’s true. There’s this creepy face that watches me the whole time,” replied Collin.

“Yeah right like we’re gonna believe that,” said one of the boys.

“You’re just a scared baby who can’t take a shower by himself,” said another.

“No guys it’s true, I can prove it!” said Collin.

“Come on guys let’s go. Collin’s ghost friend might possess us if we stick around too long.

At the time, I thought that Collin was probably just imagining things too. I snickered to myself thinking Collin was being weird again.

The next day, Collin came into school with a bigger grin on his face than usual. He was eagerly gripping his backpack as he walked into the cubby hall. Something was off. 

“Hey guys, I’ve got something to show you,” he said.

“Oh, did you bring your ghost friend with you?” sneered one of the boys.

Collin shook his head and slowly unzipped the backpack. All of us in the hallway watched as he pulled out what looked like a flimsy human mask.

It took me a second to realize that masks aren’t supposed to be made of skin."

“What’s so special about this painting?” He asked, looking at the painting, a lady in 1800’s dress type, holding a rose, oddly the woman’s hand was bleeding by the thorns of the rose. He had no idea why his parents were so strict about this painting. 

But that night he slept with uneasiness in his mind, he’s been over thinking about his college for a few days. He groaned and made his way to the kitchen, passing by the painting. As he poured himself a glass of water, he could see a figure moving by the corner of his eyes, turns out it was the curtain.

He stopped on his track as he braced himself for whatever he’s facing with as he turned himself around, he expected a burglar or some sort, but no, nobody was there. His senses were alert, he saw something move again by the corner of his eyes, it’s the painting.

Her hands were holding something unexplainable by his eyes. His heartbeat is loud and clear by the room. He could feel his legs tremble, it wasn’t over, the woman crooked her head to the side as she smiled,

An inky mess that you can see your own soul in.

The gloop rising up into bubbles, that burst with a pop that splatters the stuff over the rest of the tub.

Eventually, a creature rises from it, foetal and weak, curled up into a little ball, with it's body squishy, like the skin would bend to your finger.

With a plop, it gets ejected from the vat and splats onto the conveyor belt, painted black by the countless beings that went before it, and it moves away, onto the first machine.

It enters, ugly chugs and burps emitting from the contraption, and it emerges, bigger now, but it's head would still explode if you gripped it.

Onto the next machine.

Raspy screeches can be heard from the outside, small at first, but building louder and louder until an unbearable crescendo of noise is all that you can hear.

Once the screams reach their peak, they vanish without a trace, the thing coming out the other side still in a ball, but it's skin hard as diamonds. As if you'd be hurting yourself if you punch it.

And finally, the third machine.

Once it goes inside, nothing will be heard. Literally.

A vacuum of sound that swallows up every noise that is being made. A cancerous growth of nothingness that makes every other machine in the room fall silent.

It comes out the other side, no longer a piece of mould to shape, but standing tall and proud, ready to take orders.

The conveyor belt ends, and the creation lands with a thump next to it's brethren, the army growing one thing stronger."

The  only sensation here, apart from the cold and the numbness in my legs,  is a hard surface surrounding my whole body. The last thing I remember  before fading out of consciousness was laying in a hospital bed, my  heart rate being monitored. I felt so tired and drained until  eventually, my heart and brain had given up the fight. I slipped away,  with no one to bid me farewell. I doubt, of course, if anyone gave me  any second thought. So...this was what being buried is like? It's a  really claustrophobic sensation, being in a coffin. You're stuck in a  wooden box and it's dark and the space feels so small. I feel like  hyperventilating, but I feel no need to breath. No reason to breath when  you're dead. I don't know what's supposed to happen. All I know is that  I'm somewhere underground, and I'm by myself. Suddenly, I hear  something in the darkness. It seems like it's coming from all around me.  It's a rustling sound, like someone digging. The sound eventually turns  into the scratching of wood, like nails outside my coffin.

My wife and I find this highly strange and uncomfortable. The daughter is 16 and my wife hasn't seen this friend in years and didn't even know that she even had a child. 

At first my wife was happy that she got to catch up with her friend but when her friend enthusiastically sends her daughter to chat with me, it's highly disturbing. The most disturbing part is what the daughter talks to me about. I am an introvert as well and don't really enjoy chats. 

The daughter keeps talking about the bruises and cuts that she has received. Every week it's a new cut and a bruise because her mother uses her to possess her with demons and spirits, and the process can be messy. It's frightening to listen to and the weirdest thing is that everytime her mother forces her to go up to my room to speak to me, the daughter always tells me it's her first time speaking to me? 

Could it be a demon or a spirit that has possessed the daughter on that specific day that is speaking to me. Any how I have been escaping the house everytime my wife tells me that her friend is coming over with her daughter. There were times when my wife's friend became so disappointed that I wasn't in the house, that she just ignored my wife and just walked off like nothing has happened. 

At one point in the middle and of the night my wife's friend tried calling us to see if I was home and my wife lied telling her a strict ""no!"" 

My wife's friend came from an abusive family. One time my wife's friend came over with her daughter by surprise and she shouted at her daughter excitedly to go up and talk to me. Her daughter looked like she had never seen me and she was wearing clothes that were worn in 18th century and all she was telling me was how ""so much technology so strange and unusual century"" 

She also had two bite marks on her neck and blood seemed to be preceding from there. She had other bite marks on her body. My wife then graciously stood her ground and told her friend how unacceptable and how wrong it looked with what she was doing with her daughter and me and to her friendship. The mother left with her daughter. 

Then a couple of weeks went by and nothing happened, and I was glad. Then one day I heard knocking on the window and someone was floating. It was the daughter and she told me ""my mother said for me to talk to you, will you give me permission to enter?"" 

I want you all to know that I did not allow her access into my home."

They tell you how far you are into your day. They let you know if you are on schedule. They just *tick* away at the day. Never stopping. Never slowing. But what if I told you, that the thing that you use everyday. The clock that your day depends on. Just... stops. The clock does not *tick* away at the day, or does it? How many problems will it cause you. What will it leave you with. But more importantly... What will it do to you. Well that's what I found out one day. I work at a clock repair store. We sell more clocks than we do repair, I gat about 9-10 costumers while working my shift. It was 4:37 pm. I was nearing the end of my shift, I usually am the last person to work at the shop. on most days we close at 6 pm. Today was a Wednesday. The hundreds of clocks ticking setts a tone of a lofi beat. It's a calming felling. Like a winter morning. The foggy ones. But then the *ticking* stops. The clocks continues to *tick* after missing one *tick*. Why did all the clocks do that? I shrug it off. It was a wierd occurrence and it set of the tone for the whole day. About an hour passes. It is now 5:58 pm I grab the keys and get ready to leave after clocking out. I head the the front of the store. But the clocks all stopped. Again. They didn't continue to *tick* though. What was happening? I decide to unlock the door. The door won't open. What is seriously happening I look behind me towards the counter. An old, spruce grand father clock was there. *It wasn't there before*. the clock hand begins twitching. Then they start pulsating like veins. pumping blood though out it's clock insides as if it was somthing living. The clock hands begins to turn into an Ink-like substance. It leaks onto the ground and sits for a moment. At this point I am flipping out and trying to open the door again. The ink like substance begin to rise. it started to form a humanoid shape. This shape was large and linear. The legs where like twigs, but they where as sharp as steak knives. The hands where just like the legs. It's hands where hovering by it's knees. If it had knees. The face was blank and smooth. They had no mouth. No teeth. No noes. No eyes. We just looked at each other for the longest times. It felt like days. but it was most likely minutes. And with out warning it slowly started walking to me. it was about 15 feet away. I began to panic. It was 13 feet away from me after 3 seconds. 7 feet away in 5. It started to reach out at me. Both arms just reaching inches from my face. Then I hear the bells of the clocks chiming. The clocks began to *tick*. It was 3:47 in the morning. The thing it was gone, the grandfather clock was gone too. Nothing was there to prove that it had ever happened. I immediately open the door and begin to run home to my apartment. I will never forget what happened that night. I will never forget it's arms. It's sharp legs. And absent face. Don't let the clocks stop."

Beside me Tiffany has one of her bones, a quite heavy  and thick one from a cow’s leg, held under her paws covetously like a bar of gold. It’s not a surprise that she has one in the bedroom, it was probably stashed under the bed or something. As my hand goes for it she snarls, but she backs down easy when my fingers actually touch the now slimy thing. I apologize and tell her that she can chew later but right now is sleeping time. I rise from bed like a zombie climbing out of his grave and put the bone out in the hallway, too tired to care where it goes as long as it’s out of her mouth. Tiffany whines as I join her again in bed and I let her head rest on my chest as I quickly drift back into a dream.

   6:12AM, my sleep is interrupted again by the same racket. I curse and reach over to take the bone, too groggy to wonder how she got it again, but as my hand touches fur I freeze. To my surprise my 74 pound german shepherd mix is shaking like a leaf with her ears laid back and her tail between her legs. In three years I’ve never seen her this afraid. Can dogs have nightmares, I wonder? Concerned but still only half conscious I sit up and start to stroke her back, asking her what’s the matter. My awareness snaps back abruptly and my concern is now for both of us when I realize what has her spooked. Her bone is now being chewed on the other side of my door... And we just heard it crack."

My friend Brian got obsessed with the stuff. He was obsessed with anything that gave him a competitive edge in the weight room. 

When Brian started taking “deer antler,” he upped his deadlift to 900 pounds. Recently, he tried “ox shoulder.” Maxed his clean and jerk, an impressive 500.

Last weekend Brian decided to go for the world record bench press –– 775 pounds –– in honor of our friend Jake Smith. Jake was another competitive weightlifter. He died last summer in a car crash. 

“Jake’s strength –– I feel it.”

Brian downed a bone broth shake and began.

400 pounds, three reps. 500, two reps. At 600, he started going up by fifty pounds, one rep each time. 

At every interval, he chugged a bone broth shake. He was stuffed. It burbled out of his mouth, frothing at the edges. 

Brian put on 775, downed a shake, got under the bar. The cheers in the weight room were deafening. 

“GET SOME, BRI!” 

“GET YOKED, SON!” 

“THROWN IT THROUGH THE FRIGGIN’ ROOF, BABY!”

When the bar reached its apex, both of Brian’s elbows ruptured, and the bar fell. The spotters didn’t catch it. It crushed Brian, broke the bench in half, and killed him instantly. 

The paramedics came. One of them found Brian’s zip-lock bag of bone broth protein powder. Examining the name on the piece of tape covering the plastic, the paramedic asked:

“Who’s Jake Smith? It looks like this protein powder belonged to him.”"

She's either killed or abducted everyone in the building. All the students, all the staff, all of them are dead or kidnapped. How she managed to do so, I'm never going to find out. She somehow cleaned up all the blood and organs, and left no trace.

I alone slipped through the cracks. I was in the bathroom at the time of the massacre. I went back to the cafeteria, to see her soaked in blood.

She saw me, and ran for me, laughing madly. I ran away as fast as I could. I ran, and I ran, but she was always close behind.

I holed up in the staff room and scavenged what little food I could find. I sneaked out, and hid in the art room. I found this journal, in case the police come and I'm not alive anymore.

I can hear her sometimes, saying things like ""Where are you, sweetie?"" and ""Come on out, I won't hurt you!""

She's getting close. She may still be here if you find this. Please, get out of here while you can.

The hollow, deafening silence stretched for miles in every direction. Below my feet, abysmal darkness. Above my head, empty void.

Every once in a while, I would feel something. A brush against my leg, a disturbance near me. Each time, my imagination would run wild imagining the horror that caused it. In the Deep, no creature is too outlandish.

I shivered. My body was shutting down. The malicious darkness was taking hold of me. I was afraid to fall unconscious, for the Deep would surely devour me.

*Would that be so bad?*

The thought came out of the foggy depths of my empty mind, murky and blurry as everything around me.

*There’s no escape. What if I embrace it?*

I shivered again, sending vibrations through the Deep. The thoughts were foreign, like one of the many deformed monsters that were blindly swimming past me.

*Would it be so bad?*

I closed my eyes. Or did I open them? I couldn’t tell. Did I even *have* eyes?

I opened my mind to the darkness. And I heard it.

The Deep was speaking.

I shouldn’t have understood. The words were the language of some cosmic entity, a jumble of syllables and sounds I couldn’t make if I tried. But I understood.

**“Sink. Submerge your being in the abyss. Become** ***one.*****”**

So I sank. It got colder. It got darker.

As my mind opened to the Deep, the Deep opened to me. My open, closed, nonexistent eyes saw everything and nothing at the same time. I spoke with the creatures who had been observing me for the second-long millennia of my time in between.

I reached the floor of the Deep. And it spoke again.

**“Welcome.”**

I became the Deep.

The Deep became me.

The day the clocks stop counting is the day you look out the window to see that you didn't die, but everything else did. Cars frozen on busy roads; stray cats with unmoving legs on the sidewalk; squirrels suspended midair, never to reach the other branch. 
 
The day the clocks stop counting is the day you try to run out of your home, struggling to convince yourself it isn't true. You're supposed to be dead. You're not supposed to be alive. You were supposed to leave this world. You weren't supposed to be stuck in it.

You steal some junk food from a nearby store and feast on it as much as you can, but the pain in your head makes it too hard to enjoy it. You try to turn on the TV, a computer maybe, perhaps even the lights in your own home, but those all require time to function. You even try to throw yourself off the roof to make it all stop, but you bounce off the ground unaffected.

You try to count as high as you can to try and keep some kind of track of time. You throw things, you break things, you try to do anything, but it's worthless. Everything skids to a halt, except you.

But as you roam the area all alone, nobody to talk to, nothing to enjoy- it dawns on you that you'll never be freed.

They were driving down the road just enjoying each others presence when it started raining, raining hard.

The rain soon turned to ice but there wasn't a town for nearly two hours. Luckily, a miracle really there was a house. The house was big on a dirt road coming off the paved road. The house was somewhat large with lights in most rooms. The groom stepped out of the car and knocked on the door. A old lady answered the door. The groom came into the car and told her that they could stay the rest of the night, and to take their bags with their clothes and they could stay. They were a lovely couple, who had been maried for longer than they had lived. They offered food and shelter. It was a good time talking about their experiences living far away from any towns.

But soon they went to bed and the older couple confessed that they would not be there in the morning. They never said why. They told them that the required no payment that company was enough. They woke up the next day and got an early start. The older couple wasn't there, they left a twenty dollar bill on the kitchen counter, as a payment to their hospitality. They approached the next town and bought snacks for the rest of the ride. The cashier asked if they were locals or not. They replied with ""no, and that this nice couple had saved them from the storm."" He looked skeptical and asked for the adress. The man said that that house had actually ended up burning ten years ago and that it was a real sad story to hear of. He even showed them headlines from the accident. They had to go back.

They returned to the house, and had to see if what he said was true. They returned to a house that was mostly burnt accept for a few parts of the house. The kitchen where they had left the the twenty dollar bill, was less burnt and on the kitchen counter was a twenty dollar bill."

But not all the time.


My job was simple in theory, to protect people. Magic wasn’t regulated to control people, but to protect them. You see, in ignorant hands, magic can cause major problems.


My first case was a man who wanted to be immortal, something my department forbids, and for a good reason. 


Immortality prevents natural cell death. The man could never die, but neither could any of his individual cells. No wounds would heal, tumors would grow all over him, pain receptors would never diminish, and he would never truly die. 


All we could do is IV him morphine and try to keep him unconscious. 


My second case was a pregnant woman who was in a car accident, and had a miscarriage. She tried to go back in time to prevent it, but stuck herself in that moment on repeat. This case had a happier ending, as after a few weeks of torment, we managed to correct the spells she used, and put her out of the loop. She works for us now, educating other people on why some magic is best left restricted. 


We don’t try to punish people for using it, we just try to help them when it goes wrong. If we can.


My latest case hurt me. A man’s wife had passed from illness, and he tried to bring her back from the dead. Normally, resurrected people are comatose, insane, or mentally stunted, but this man tried something new. 


He merged her soul with his own. 


They found him/her/it a week later. He had been wearing a dress, bleeding from removing his genitals in an attempt to feel more feminine, and had painted his nails with the blood. The mirrors in the house were all shattered. It, (for simplicity's sake) was two souls in one body, one dead, wanting to return to nothingness, the other alive, wanting to live with his wife. One insane, the other neurotypical, at least when this began.   


I could only imagine what that had felt like.


It is currently in a padded room, screaming and mumbling incoherently, arguing with Itself.


Normally this is my dream job. We take difficult situations, and figure out the best possible way to help people. 


I have no idea how to help this guy. Worse still, my plan is ruined. 


On the way home I stop at my son's grave. Merging two souls doesn’t seem like it’ll work, but I still need to experiment more. I need to bring him back, so my wife and I can continue living our lives the way we used to. 


Bringing people back from the dead never seems to work, but I got my dream job because I can find difficult solutions to major problems. I’m one of the smartest men around. 


I work with other people who fuck up. If I try it myself, nothing bad will happen to me. "

Keeping us in our separate containers. We ponder our fate here. Since he doesn't even want us around, so he'll toss us. Left and right, up and down. Just because he's bigger than us and keeps us captive. Stronger than all of us combined. At any time he could crush us in a second or use his device to snap us in half. I've seen it done more times than I care to count. Their screams still haunt me.


 I've seen him keep the carcasses in his storage containers. Dead and pilled on top of each other. For us to ponder our fate. We are all stored in his storage containers. We can see and yell but it doesn't matter. No one can hear us.


We gather nightly and wonder who's next. Steve or maybe Ryan, Chelsea or even me. Counting the days as each of us disappears when he takes one of us each day. Spouting nonsense about it being necessary. How can our deaths be necessary? 


There's only three of us left now. I watched him call the man that will bring him more. In days they'll all come in crying and shouting on how they got here. If we're lucky the last of us will fall in with the rest and live for another day. Maybe another week, who knows. Just enough time to tell the others the truth. Why we are here and why we are forced to be fed to this monster. One by one slowly being put into the palm of his hand and into his mouth and drowned by water. We are his ""medication"" just here to keep this man alive one more day."

&#x200B;

My wife went out for one of her night walks...

&#x200B;

and didn't come back.

&#x200B;

The investigation wasn't going anywhere.

&#x200B;

I told them all I knew about her, I did everything I could to help...like a good husband.

&#x200B;

But it didn't matter how much they looked into the case or searched for her nothing came out of it.

&#x200B;

I was done with all that crap, what a waste of time.

I told them to just give up, sadly they didn't listen.

&#x200B;

The officers told me that they found ""her"" wandering around the old well into the woods. I looked down at the thing holding me. It looked exactly like her, it had her face, her hair, her voice...but that thing was not my wife.

After the officers left, I didn't know what to do. I tried acting normally around that thing they brough to me, it was hard, I felt like it's eyes could pierce through my soul.

That things acted like my wife, talked like my wife, but it wasn't her. Sometimes I would wake up and she would me sitting besides me on the bed...just looking at me, wide eyed. I would often caught it lurking around the coners as if it was waiting for the perfect chance to get to me.

&#x200B;

No matter what happens...you have to believe me, that thing is not my wife!

&#x200B;

Why am I so sure?

&#x200B;

Because I killed my wife.

Then I threw her lifeless corpse...in the old well."
k6osj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k6osj9/the_tale_of_bunnyrabid/,The Tale of Bunny-Rabid,40,9,1607101253.0,"Bunny-Rabid lived happily alone in a deep hole in the woods that was made by a meteor that hit the world a long time ago.

For centuries he was undisturbed.

He was so elusive he didn't figure in myth or fairy tale.

But one day a developer bought the wild land on which Bunny-Rabid lived, and began sending surveyors and workmen into the woods.

Bunny-Rabid disliked this.

He clawed the surveyors to fleshy shreds and performed black magic on the workmen until their sanity turned inside out and they could no longer continue their work.

The developer reported to the police, who duly investigated the surveyors' grisly deaths, but their findings were inconclusive and they soon gave up.

The invertedly-sane workmen, however, gabbled in their snugly fitting straightjackets about an evil bunnyman who performed horror spells in the woods.

One day, a doctor recorded their gabblings and published them in a book called *The Evil Bunnyman and Other Modern Terrors*.

A cryptozoologist read the book, gathered a team and ventured into the woods. He brought his son, Charlie.

For weeks the team traversed the wilderness, examining and recording their findings. They were about to turn back when they came upon a hole.

This was Bunny-Rabid's meteor hole, and he disliked that the cryptozoologist had found it.

Bunny-Rabid waited until dark, then cast a stream of fire out of the meteor hole and emerged in its unsteady, burning light, holding tightly his bone-staff, which curled at the end like a monstrous hook, and spoke the words of insanity into the terrified faces of the cryptozoologist and his team.

They were ill-prepared to hear the swirling speech of whispers as Bunny-Rabid's gaunt and liquid face scrambled and spun so that his crooked eyes began orbiting his ossified nose, and his ancient maw snarled itself into a string of fangs which encircled his head like a crown of yellowed thorns.

They all went mad.

Except Charlie, who smiled.

It was a hideous smile, full of tenderness and warmth, and it made Bunny-Rabid shiver.

In the nighttime woods behind, the mad ones ran head-long into trees and screamed and murdered one another with their cryptozoology equipment and their bare hands.

But Charlie stepped toward Bunny-Rabid and—horror of unmentionable horrors!—hugged him.

Charlie was mute but Bunny-Rabid heard the boy's thoughts.

In fact, he couldn't silence them.

And he could not invert the little human's sanity.

""You killed my father,"" Charlie was thinking, ""so from today you are my father, and I am your little bunny son. You will teach me the black magic and other bunny ways, and together we shall live in the meteor hole in the woods.""

*No!* Bunny-Rabid thundered. *Never! Such unnature cannot be!*

Yet it was.

Charlie was impervious to all Bunny-Rabid's spells and violence, and he followed Bunny-Rabid through the woods, thinking his thoughts aloud, day after dreadful day, until Bunny-Rabid grudgingly agreed.

And that is how Bunny-Rabid finally became a father, for which we shall all pay dearly."
k6oois,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k6oois/knock_knock_knock/,Knock Knock Knock,25,4,1607100934.0,"Have you seen the old Agnew house? The unkempt one that people avoid, the one that causes folks to move to the other side of the street instead of crossing it’s cracked sidewalks. It’s been abandoned for over fifty years now. Those were simpler times, back when nobody felt the need to lock their doors.

Mrs. Agnew lived in that sprawling estate alone. Until one evening when she heard three sharp knocks on her front door. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Shocked that anyone would wake her at this hour, she first checked the peephole, but something was wrong. She saw nothing but blackness through the lense.

“Who’s there?” She demanded. 

“May I please come in?” Replied a strange voice. Just hearing it gave her the chills. Holding back her fear, Mrs. Agnew replied.

“This is my house and I’m not allowing anyone inside who I don’t recognize. Especially at 2AM.”

“There’s room for us both.” The foreign voice replied.

“You get out of here before I call the police!” Mrs. Agnew said. Silence was the only response. There were no more disturbances that evening.

A few days later, the three knocks returned, but louder this time. Mrs. Agnew approached the door, again she could only see black through the peephole.

“Please let me in.” The strange voice drawled. Without a word she called the police, and they came immediately. However, when they arrived, they could find no signs of anyone. The officers suggested she may have imagined the noises, but she insisted, so the police said they’d send someone by every so often to check in on her.

Several days passed with no disturbances. But nearly a week later, just after midnight, the knocks returned. Except this time they weren’t knocking. The pounding on the door sounded as if they’d taken a battering ram to it. The effort shook the walls and cracked the door. She called the police, telling them she hears someone at the front door and the back door. Her last words before the line went dead were, “I think they’re inside.”

By the time the police arrived, the home was perfectly quiet. The police kicked in the door to find Mrs. Agnew dead in her bed upstairs. Detectives said something choked her with some sort of rope that was pulled so tight it broke her neck.

One detail confounded the police. All the doors and windows were latched from the inside. While they found no one, it appeared that whoever killed her never left. No one has dared enter that house since.

I know this story seems strange, but it’s true. I know this because fifty years ago, not long after Mrs. Agnew was killed, the knocking began in my house. I think the reason we were unharmed is because, unlike Mrs. Agnew, my father understood that neighborhoods change and some forces can't be stopped, and he wasn’t afraid. So when the knocking started, he simply opened the door."

With a bit of a hop in his step he turned to the unlit part of the room where the table was kept. Facing it he reached behind him and flipped the switch. Flickbuzzzz. Blinded for a second but his gaze never leaving the table he focused again and he saw…nothing. The table was empty. The restraints hanging off the sides. He frantically looked around both confused and angry but before he could do anything THWACK. 
Everything went black.
He opened his eyes. The world a bright white then fading into focus. Trying to move but unable he began to scream. His vocal cords tearing at the strain but to no avail. Regaining a semblance of composure he began bartering with his hostage-turned-hostage taker. Begging for his life claiming to never do it again. On and on. Finally, stopping to catch his breath in hopes of a reply he heard the door open. Then close."

Anything greasy would do. Sadly, it seemed that everyone had gone home for the night. Restaurants were all closed. Sidewalks were empty. Even the streets were silent.

Lost in thought, I came upon a diner. When last I surveyed my surroundings I hadn’t noticed a diner. Strange. A few feet away, the front door popped open. Warm light and sweet smells poured onto the sidewalk. Soon, any trepidations I had melted away like warm butter. 

I sat in the nearest booth. Glossy red upholstery towered over me, allowing me to sink into the cushions body and soul. As I relaxed, a blonde waitress with piercing eyes and striking red lipstick strutted from the kitchen. A steaming plate of plain buttermilk pancakes balanced on her fingertips. With her free hand, she selected a song on the jukebox.

Passionate piano music echoed through the establishment. When the waitress turned around, I tried to look away, but not even my eyeballs could move. Nothing would move. Unaffected, the waitress met my gaze and lurked closer. 

When she presented me with the pancakes, I noticed something odd. A faint sound. Cooing? No. Whimpering. The stack shivered, afraid. Noticing my own fear, the waitress placed my hand on the pancakes.

They had a heartbeat. 

Puppeted by the music, my body stood up and started stripping. As my clothes dropped, the waitress smeared butter all over the shivering pancakes. Then she drenched them all in syrup. 

Naked, I returned. Against my bare flesh, the glossy material felt as slick as my inner lip. Dread churned my stomach. I tried again to run. But, paralyzed, I could only sit helplessly as the music forced me deeper into the cushion’s embrace. 

Without mercy, the waitress picked up a fork and stabbed the pancakes. Blood oozed out. The stack had no mouth, but it could scream. And oh, it screamed. Undisturbed, the waitress started cutting. As she yanked the knife back and forth, I heard bones cracking.  

Once freed, the waitress raised the severed chunk on her fork. Its crimson interior bled like a just-lost limb. Still smiling, she forced it into my mouth. It tasted sweet, like rotting meat. Every primal reflex told me to spit it out. But, the music had other plans. Bite after helpless bite, I chewed, and crunched, and swallowed. She hacked off more pieces, the pancakes wailed, and I gagged it all down until nothing but blood and syrup remained.

Proud of her work, she cleaned the juices off my face and strutted back into the kitchen. While I waited, the song ended. My heart jumped. My entire body shivered. I could move again. 

Too drunk to remember my clothes, I jammed my fingers in my ears. The waitress tried to restart the jukebox. But, before she could, I bolted naked out the front door and dashed off into the night, never to return."

“Nothing,” I lie and force a smile.

Of course it’s something, and the more time passes since the conversation with Tony, the more it creeps into my head.
*You heard about what happened over in Scranton, last week? Another one of those crazies…you know, the body weirdos. Lady thought her dude was cool and everything, but then it turns out he was one of ‘them’; wearing her husband’s face. Sicko got her in the middle of the night. They never found her skin. The freaks! Hey, I’m just sayin’, but you gotta tell me if you’re one of them, okay? I want to make my skin all lotiony-smooth before you get me. Ha ha!*

I had heard about the Scranton thing. I mean, who didn’t—it was national news. And that wasn’t the only time the group had struck. In fact, it was one of a few dozen cases, in the past year, from all over the country. 

“Come on, sweetie. I’m here for you.” More insistent this time; a bit throaty.

“Okay. To tell you the truth, I’m worried about Trish,” I confess. “She hasn’t been the same since she got back from that band trip. I had thought she was sick, but now I’m not so sure…”

Cherie’s chuckle has a weird twang to it these days. “I wouldn’t worry about it. You know those kids were together the whole time, and I haven’t yet heard of any kid killers. Just come back to bed…it’s nice and warm for you.”

“No. I need to feel her head. I know it’s crazy, but just the thought of one of those freaks making her into a skin-suit…ugh!”

I’m gone a minute. My daughter Trish’s bedroom is just down the hall; she’s good, of course. The best part is that the kitchen is right there. The steak knife I acquire isn’t big, but it’s better than nothing.

“What’s the verdict?” Cherie teases upon my return. In this lighting, I see her skin sagging a bit, especially around her eyes. She’d lost a good deal of weight on her latest three-week business trip. *Lots of down time, and not so much pizza!* she’d claimed.

Cherie doesn’t eat pizza. Terrifying, right?

I climb into the warm bed wondering why I hadn’t put the clues together earlier: the trip, body changes, food choices, voice change, calling me “sweetie” all the time. However, just before I slam the knife into the back of her neck, I make for certain sure that I feel the skin suit’s zipper tucked deep down in those curly locks."

Like many otaku, I always longed to find a girl to truly love, a girl I would do anything for. From the tiny mole on her left thigh to the way her tummy showed under her shirt when she lifted her arms, Megumi was perfect in every way. I binged the series in a day and ordered a Megumi body pillow immediately.

   Even with the fastest shipping, it took two agonizing weeks for Megumi to arrive. The moment that she did, I unpacked her, held her tight, and immediately decided to take a nap while snuggling with my beloved Megumi. I dreamed that we were together at the beach, watching the sunset over the ocean. She held my hand and traced her index finger against my palm. ""I wish I could hold your hand"" her words ended the dream. For a long time, I opened and closed my hand over and over again, hoping to feel her fingers once more, but of course, I felt nothing.

   I had the same dream every night, and every morning when I squeezed Megumi I could tell she longed to hold my hand. Gradually, her impossible wish became all-encompassing. It was impossible. However, I had a horrific idea. An almost laughable idea. Yet, my dreams grew more vivid, and with each night that idea grew worthier of consideration.

   I always told myself I would give anything for my waifu. It was the middle of the night when, after days of building up the nerve, I was ready to fulfill her wish. I wrapped rubber bands tight around my pinky finger until it grew purple and numb. Then, I slid it between the hinges of my bedroom door. With a slam, my gift to Megumi fell to the floor. Blood covered my hand like a glove. Hands trembling, I took the finger and stitched it onto Megumi. I felt like throwing up, I couldn't tell whether it was from shock or anticipation. Finally, I placed what was left of my damaged hand against the finger and, sure enough, she gently squeezed it. I could feel her gratitude.

   After that first gift, the rest were easy. I love Megumi unconditionally. From ""I want to be able to walk beside you"" to ""I want to look into your eyes."" Every wish she made, I delivered. Gradually, I almost ran out of gifts to give.

   Whether from infection or blood loss, I, bedridden, drifted in and out of restless sleep. She came to me again in a fractured dream and whispered into my ear ""I want to love you forever...""

   Pain jolted me awake. The body pillow hung limp beneath the malignant growth of quivering limbs and guts that I had donated. Her hands greedily ripped at my ribs, her flesh bore down upon me. From somewhere within that mass, Megumi finished her sentence ""...with all of my heart."""

He desk and his chair were like a lone outpost
A haunted corner, with him as the ghost

She made eye contact, holding it just a beat, before looking away and smiling demurely, not showing her teeth. Another glance towards him, another smile, and then she tossed her hair off her shoulder with a flip of her chin and turned away.

She was sending all the right signals. 

He approached, bought her a drink, made small talk. He told her he was a lawyer. It was a lie, but she’d never know. She said she studied fireflies or something like that. He really wasn’t paying attention. One thought occupied his mind; he was getting laid tonight. She was sending all the right signals.

She suggested they go back to her place. It wasn’t far, so they walked. She looped her arm through his, glancing at him every few steps, always with that demure, closed lipped smile. In the hall outside of her apartment, she grabbed him by the tie and kissed him. Her tongue darted into his mouth to tease his own. She pressed her breasts into his chest. He could feel her erect nipples through his sportcoat. These weren’t just signals anymore. This was a million watt lighthouse beacon flashing “Bang me! Bang me!” 

She pulled him into the apartment, pushed the door closed with her hip, and reached over her shoulder to throw the deadbolt. Her eyes fixed on him, that demure smile playing across her lips. Excitement welled in his belly, but he had to play it cool. She was giving off all the right signals, but rushing things could ruin the mood.

Instead, he looked around her place. There wasn’t much to see. Just a couple pieces of Ikea furniture in the living room, a half dozen books on a shelf, a poster of beetles, the bugs, not the band, taped to the wall. It was almost sterile.

“So this is how an entomologist lives.” he said, keeping his tone light and playful.

“Who said I was an entomologist?” she asked, reaching up to lace her fingers behind his neck. Her hips drifted against his groin. He was throbbing. She had to feel it.

“Isn’t that what you said at the bar? That you studied lightning bugs or something?”

“Ah,” she said. “*Photuris lucicrescens*, the firefly *femme fatale*. Fascinating insects. They’ve evolved to mimic the mating flashes of the females of other firefly species. They give off all the right signals to attract the males of those species.”

“Wow, they must be really horny,” he grinned, resting his hands on her hips, pushing himself a little harder against her.

I’m eating a slice of cold pizza with a few olives still wet from the jar on top. We all know that our vision adjusts to the light, but so do our other senses. I would never eat like this in the sunlight. “Dad, can we go to the zoo?” asks my daughter. I look from the screen to her and back. I’m not going to get anything done tonight. “C’mon,” says my daughter, stretching the vowel out until the consonants on either end fall into the yawning gap between them. I yawn. We go to the zoo.

She picks flowers as we walk there and strings a daisy-chain anadem. Most of her favorite animals are asleep when we arrive, but she likes to watch them sleep. We guess their dreams. The hungry, hungry hippos are dreaming of whatever the Nile offers in the way of nourishment, pharaohs or green mangoes. I do my best impression of Thutmose IV on an unsuccessful hippo hunt. My daughter’s raven ringlets oscillate as she giggles. When we’ve seen everything, we exit the Hall of Regular Animals.

Going to the Hall of Irregular Animals is always weird for us. I stop her at the threshold to remind her that, taxonomically, people are animals, too. I analogize that sometimes the most irregular pancake holds the most blueberries. I’m moved by my own eloquence.

The first exhibit is the psychic vampire, sort of like an emotional toll booth. The whole zoo was built around him the way that banks are built around vaults. When the zoo was still a college campus, he was a janitor. When his true nature was discovered, someone padlocked the door while he was taking a nap in the janitor’s closet, and they’ve been adding irregular animals ever since. I know that it’s just the vampire, but I think of my daughter differently when we walk by. I let go of her hand. I don’t want to keep going. She turns back to me, shines a baby-teeth smile, and runs ahead to the next exhibit. I feel better as I follow her away.

Her mother is at the end of a hallway, passed the sasquatch and sirens. Her enclosure is an artificial meadow of myrtle, mock orange, and cloves. My daughter runs up and puts her palms on the glass. “Fay” reads the plaque, a being from another realm. She told me that she was from Delaware. My ex comes to greet us with a new inmate. Feeding time was supposed to have happened during visiting hours, but there’s blood around their mouths. She gestures to us and whispers in the other fay’s ear. His black curls sway as he laughs.

My daughter looks at me in a way that she never would in the sunlight. “Paternity test,” I remember. That’s why I opened that tab."

Her *great-great* aunt? Whatever she was, Aunt Milly was old. That’s why dad’s running joke was so funny. Milly rolled around in her electric wheelchair at a snail’s pace. But she was no motorhead. 

The joke came about because you could always count on Milly for one thing: incessant groaning about her 1908 Ford Model T. Milly was obsessed with that car, which sat in our garage from the day she came to live with us until the day she died. 

According to mom, Milly’s family had been dirt poor. They got walloped during the Great Depression. Rummaging through the basement with my brother Nick as kids, we found a photo album. There was an old photo of Milly, her mom and dad, and her sisters. All were dust-swept, wearing stern looks chiseled into still-life. Behind them was the Model T. Milly’s dad had somehow managed to buy on his shoestring income. 

Milly’s family died shortly after the photo was taken. Everything on their homestead burned to the ground. But Milly lived, running to the neighbors for help. The Model T lived too. Despite the improbability, it survived a barn burning down around it. 

We always assumed that’s why Milly was attached to the car. It was a family heirloom. 

For Aunt Milly’s birthday last summer, I spent a week fixing the Model T with dad. When he went to start it, I stopped him. 

“Let’s wait until her birthday.” 

“Aunt Milly’s a real motorhead,” dad replied, chuckling. “You win.”

The Model T sat in our garage until Milly’s birthday, waiting for its resurrection.

“Gotcha something special, Aunt Milly.”

*“Urggghhh.”*

“Yes,” mom said, interpreting Milly’s meaning. “It *is* your birthday!”

We walked onto the front porch. Milly saw the Model T in the driveway. Her eyes peeled.

*“URGGGHHH!”*

“Think nothing of it,” dad said. “It’s the least we could do.”

Nick was in the driver’s seat, waiting for dad’s signal. Milly trembled. I thought it was excitement. Later, I realized it was terror.

“Hit it, Nick!” 

The Model T erupted to life, belching black smoke. The hood flew open. A massive, oily arm the size of a twenty-year-old oak tree shot out. Aunt Milly screamed as the monstrous, clawed hand reaching from the engine grabbed her head. She stopped screaming after a few wet smashes against the porch. Milly’s blood sprayed mom’s face. Her spinal cord wrapped around dad’s arm like a pet snake. Her teeth shot out like marbles of hail, peppering the house.

The arm sucked back under the hood. The car sagged on its chassis and died. Mom kept screaming. Nick crawled away in panic. Dad attempted CPR on Milly’s blood spot while I tried to make sense of what happened.

And then I realized: whatever Faustian bargain Milly’s dad made for the Model T, the debt was finally paid. The thing from the engine had claimed the one family member it hadn’t on the night Milly’s childhood home burned down."

They didn’t seem to be thinking. All they were doing was chasing me. My legs felt weak and I could hear the buzz of the crowd behind me. However, I came across a boarded up barn, so I sneaked in, hoping to find shelter or a place to hide. Fortunately, I found a barrel, stacked on top of another barrel, hidden behind some hay. I climbed into the hollow space inside the wall. I rested and breathed a sigh of relief. I had escaped, I had eluded the swarm and gone into hiding. They would never find me. or so I thought. The hair on the back of my neck stuck straight up. I reached my hand and felt a tingling sensation on my back. I looked back and what I found shocked me. 

I ran as fast as I could towards the entrance of the barn. The swarm had blocked me in, there was no way out. I heard the stomping of footsteps on the wooden planks behind me. I closed my eyes and embraced what was to come. Only, nothing happened. I stood there, eyes still closed, but the buzzing of the swarm had ceased and all was silent. I slowly started to open my eyes as I felt a warm pain hitting my flesh. I felt it all around me, my legs, my arms, my chest, my face. I couldn’t move. Why did I think it was a good idea to experiment on locusts?

Could be noise coming from the building or even worse, noise coming from a person. I have lived in apartments with a noisy neighbour and even a room mate, but never have I heard a complaint about someone being too quite. 

A couple of months ago I moved into a new apartment block and I chose it because it was new. Everything about my apartment seemed amazing at first and my neighbours seemed amazing as well. My flat mate wasn't living with me at the time. 

After my first week of living in my new flat the concierge down at the reception called me up to tell me that multiple complaints have been filed against me for being too quite. I argued back as it didn't make sense. Then during the third week of living here many of the residents tried breaking down my door as they thought I was dead because I was being too quite. 

The company that owns the building paid and fixed the damage. That's when I started playing music through out the week to stop people complaining that I am too quite. When my flat mate arrived he was ok at first, but then he himself along with the other residents started to complain that I wasn't being loud enough after a couple of weeks. 

I started to become mad and people didn't mind that I was getting mad and angry because it made me loud. I started playing louder music with bass in the background. I prefer quite though and when I switched it off and was just enjoying the quietness, a flood of knocks to my door started to come at me. 

Phone calls and complaints to the concierge arrived in numbers about me being too quite. Everyone thought I was dead and even my flat mate shouted at me for being too quite. I just lashed out at my flat mate, the other residents knocking at my door and to the concierge, I told them that I don't give a shit that I am being too quite. 

Things have calmed down but I do get visits from police and ambulance to check if I am alive. My flat mate is now leaving due to my quietness and the constant anxiety of wondering if I am dead or not. 

What on earth is going on?"

That first step, the one which is slightly weaker than the others and groans at length underfoot. That is the start.

They are slow, yet follow a rhythm, like a dance. It seems so familiar yet I can't quite recognise it and it taunts me.

Creak. Clack. Creak.

This is where I start to freeze up. I feel my heartbeat hard and fast, my fingers and toes go numb and I clutch my old ragged bear tight in my arms. Every night the door opens the same. Just a peek at first, and then wide open.

It stares. I don't look, I never have, but I can feel it, it's instinctual. Again, every time it's the same, 5 minutes and they tick down slower by the second as I watch the luminous alarm clock on my bedside table.

Then the worst part.

Moving right up to the foot of my bed, it bends down, slightly lifting the covers and starts to slide its way inside. As it crawls up through the sheets towards the head of the bed it softly drags it's hand over my side, up to my shoulder where it lingers. Each finger feels so thin and hard as it holds me and I fight back the fear and the adrenaline welling up inside.

Finally, it loses interest in me, I feel it curl up into the bed, just like me and I feel it's eyes burning into the back of my head but I never turn. We stay there, and I watch the same patch on the wall, the one that almost looks like a smiley face. That's how we stay for hours.

When I get up its the same too. I wait for the sun to peek through the gap in my curtains and I wait to make sure I am alone. I get up, showered, dressed and ready for my day before going downstairs to my dad who will be cooking his fry up breakfast. He comments on the bags under my eyes and I brush it off, eating my portion of the food and doing the last thing before school.

Tulips grow under the window to our garden so I pick one and walk right to the end of the grass, right where the row of huge oak trees watch over us. Every morning I lay the flower on her grave and stay with her a while, telling her which of her many records I played just yesterday and how I just want to sleep.

I love you mum. I just wish I could see you one last time."

&#x200B;

She’s always been a spooky little girl, more interested in scary stories than fairy tales or princesses. She would always ask to hear one each night before she read to me out of her books. I usually make them up on the spot, some turn out better than others. But this time I may have taken it too far. I was out of ideas, and decided to tell her about the urban legend that everybody knows. 

&#x200B;

Most versions I have heard say that if you call her three times while looking into a mirror in the dark she will appear before you, covered in blood. That's the version I was told, anyway. When I finished telling her the tale, her mouth hung open.

&#x200B;

“Is that true? Does she really exist?” she asked, gripping her blanket and pulling it up to her chin. 

&#x200B;

“No, sweetie, it’s just a story. People try it, but it’s just for fun,” I said, giving her a grin. She didn’t look entirely convinced, though she didn’t bring it up again. She read me some stories, and after that I didn’t think much on it.

&#x200B;

The following evening she seemed distracted while I told her a half-assed tale about an evil mummy. When I was done, she grabbed my hand.

&#x200B;

“Dad, I want to try to see Bloody Mary tonight,” she whispered. I was taken aback, it took me a moment to reply.

&#x200B;

“Look, Hannah, she’s not real, you don’t need to scare yourself before bed, okay?”

&#x200B;

“No, Dad, I have to try it so I know it isn’t real. It will help me sleep better!” she insisted. I studied her for a long minute, deciding what to do. 

&#x200B;

“Okay… But I’m going to wait on the other side of the door.”

&#x200B;

Against my better judgement, I found myself following her to the bathroom. I lit a candle and put it on the sink for her. She gave me a big grin before she closed the door. 

&#x200B;

“Bloody Mary…” I heard her whisper. My hair stood on end.

&#x200B;

“Bloody Mary…”

She shuddered with each breath. I held her close for a while before I realized what was happening. She was laughing, completely busting up at my gullibility, cackling so hard that she was sobbing.

&#x200B;

“Dad… that was... the…best joke… I have ever… pulled on you!” she howled. I tried to force a laugh, but I couldn't.

He saw what he wanted, and he stopped at nothing to get a hold of it. And that ""something"" was me. 


Never mind that I wasn't into Brett. He'd change me mind, he said. He'd change my mind about a lot of things, he said.


Change me for the better, he said.


Called me his ""project"". What a sweetheart.


Always acted like he was doing me a huge favour by dating me. He told me so, too. 


I tried to leave him three times, but he always tracked me down. Had a way of convincing me to take him back. Violence and intimidation can sure change a person's mind. 


I felt like I was drowning, and all of my family and friends could see me from the shore. But I was waving for help with a broken wrist. I was silenced, coerced, controlled completely. 


But eventually, my dad filed a court order against Brett. So Brett and I went on the run, ""like Bonnie and Clyde"", he said. We moved to Brett's Aunt's house in Phoenix. Nice place; secluded, with a swimming pool. She's deaf, and bedridden. Pretty doped up. Brett sees to that. 


But you have to hand it to Brett. He's a fighter. He's got pluck. Spirit. The sort of spirit you inadvertently summon with a Ouija board, if you believe that crap.


He just won't give up. Keeps pleading with me for one last chance. Typically, his pleads soon turn to screams. Insults. Threats. The things he'll do to me. 


But he can't, not this time.


His angry hands only hit the surface of the water, though I still wince every time he swings.


I told him we should try out the pool, tonight. Swim naked in the moonlight. I planned ahead. Hid his baseball bat beneath a lawn chair. Took my chance whilst he was pulling his vest over his head. He yelled enough to wake the dead. But there's no-one else around. I can tell the cops that it was self defense. That I didn't push him in. That he fell. I can convince them. I have enough bruises from this baseball bat.


I might have broken his wrists, but boy, he can still swing. And kick, though both his ankles are broken, too. More like the insane thrashing of an injured animal. 


His head hasn't bobbed up for a while, now. Just occasionally, an arm will break the surface. He's waving. Waving for help? Waving goodbye? I can't tell. It's hard to say, exactly. 


Though it's dark out, I can see him sinking ten feet down into the deep end. Still waving, rather pathetically now. Making ripples rather than waves. It's soothing. The lapping of a gentle stream."

Today his hand is outstretched as if to clasp my shoulder but frozen in time. Hovering. Six inches away, not touching, never touching. Motionless. Silent.

He taunts me. He never touches me and he never makes a sound, but every day now he stands behind me. Watches me with his one eye.

I don't know how he moves. I've never caught him doing it. All I know is since that day, he visits me whenever he pleases.

That damnable day! Doors do not stop him and neither does distance!

Always he finds me when I think I am safe. Always staring at the back of my head, *I know what you did*. His presence drives me mad!

At first I ran, skipping from town to town. He let me wait, then, let me think I had gotten far enough away. Wait to feel safe again. Wait to feel free.

Now he's here constantly, hovering over me. His one eye hanging from the cavernous hole in his head. He only needs the one eye; he only ever looks at me. *What did you do to me?* He doesn't need to speak to ask the question. The hole asks it for him.

I've learned to keep my head down and my gaze forward. I never look around anymore, but it doesn't matter. He finds ways to be felt. Ways to remind me. A chill on my neck and the smell of soil.

Damn you! Damn you to hell! I'd do it again if it meant being rid of you!

My friends had left me at the rock wall to go play with the girls in the field. When I asked if I could come, I was told that ""only handsome boys get to play with the girls."" 

I didn't know who she was at the time, but she comforted me. She held my hand as I climbed up the rock wall. She told me ""I'll always be here for you, Benjamin."" Her appearance was frightening at first, but I accepted her into my life. I mean, I had nobody else, and it beat staying alone in my thoughts every day on the playground.

She was never over a stone's throw away in middle school. As I scribbled for hours in the library, struggling to make sense of the numbers and equations on math homework, she put her hand on my shoulder, saying ""I'm always here for you, Benjamin."" I learned her name to be Sue: she had the complexion of a shadow, mystical, and frightening. As we bonded, I felt less afraid than I did on the rock wall in 5th grade. She gave me a sense of comfort, she made me feel okay. I always knew she would be there for me.

We walked through the school halls together. When my old friends pushed me into the locker, she held my hand tightly as the locker door was slammed over and over. I don't know how she took it; my hand was beaten and purple by the time they'd finished, but hers remained intertwined with mine. She sat on the other side of the handicapped stall when I cried at lunchtime, choking down the peanut butter sandwich and milk that the school dumped onto our trays. Sue held my hand every night, always reminding me that she was here for me. She would always be here for me, until the end. She lay with me in bed as my stepdad bust down the door, screaming about how I'm nothing. She hugged me, her words infiltrating my mind as I cried for hours every night. She was always there.

On the last day of high school, after the woman reading the names of the graduating class stumbled over mine, she took me on our first date. She scribbled a note for me in janky handwriting in case my stepdad walked in, and we ran out the house. 

Sue took me to a bridge, overlooking the city. The city that hated me. The city full of bullies. The city that had millions of people, yet not one eager to befriend me.

Except Sue.

Sue took my shaking hand as we stepped onto the bridge. The dark water glimmered in anticipation hundreds of feet below.

Tonight, we will step, together.

Sue was always with me. She was always in my mind. She said she would be with me until I die.

I brought you back and yet you’re still trying to choose him. He only wanted you because of your beauty. Well beauty is only skin deep and that only works if your still alive. You still chase after him on your shambled and gaunt legs while the bones break under the pressure and pierce your flesh. So you drag yourself towards him, bones creaking with every move. You were so smitten when he said he loved your eyes. So what did you do now? You took them out and gave them to him. He threw them aside and ran, just like he did with your love when you were still here. Would I have done that?! Now not only is your jaw slack and hanging, and your skin dripping off your very foundation, but black holes now take residence in your skull. I still haven’t left you! I’m right here! Why the fuck don’t you want me?! You scream after him. Your voice sounding incoherent and frantic. Like nails on a chalkboard. My favorite. Look at you! Crying for him while the only man who ever loved you is standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. But fine, you want him? Because he’s beautiful, because he’s strong, because he’s not me? I’ll get him. I should’ve never brought you back so I’m returning you to ground that I dug you out from and HE is going in with you. No no no I’m not killing him and letting you two spend eternity together. That’s be too good and I’ve done enough for you. I’m putting him in alive! So you can sit and watch his body decay just like you sat and watched my heart decay. Like I said, beauty is only skin deep. And when his starts to fall off, let’s see if you still want him then."

I sighed, looking over my book at my frazzled wife, Charlotte. 

“Oh, good, you’re awake. This is our home.” I dog-eared the page I was on and set it down. “It’s been our home for twenty years now Charlotte,” 

“Who is Charlotte?” 

That one simple question seemed to break whatever left of my heart. Every day I’d wake up with a molecule of optimism, only to be sorely reminded by Charlotte’s condition which always lurked like a shadow above us. 

I gently reached out to hold her hand and guided her to sit beside me on the couch. I tried to wrap my arm around her shoulder and, she flinched, almost by instinct. 

It felt like a slap in my face. 

“You are Charlotte, my wife of twenty-three years.” I began, all too familiar with my monologue. “You work as an independent interior designer, and you’re brilliant at it. You’ve designed so many gorgeous spaces, including this, our home.” 

She stared at me dumbfounded, partly because this seemed unfamiliar to her and partly because of the heavy dosage of medication. 

“No,” Charlotte spoke, barely a whisper. 

“No what, darling?” I asked.

She stared back at me, eyes brimming with tears. “I’m not your wife. I need to leave. I’m not Charlotte!” She was screaming, filled with rage.

I had read on the internet that this would happen, sooner or later, I just always thought I had more time. I tried everything under the roof to not let her Alzheimer’s take full control. Long car rides, weekends at the beach, Sunday night board games—I routinely kept old traditions alive in hopes of beating the disease. 

I inched closer, trying to get her to calm down, she stood up too quickly, pulling herself away. 

“Get away from me. I don’t know you!”

I stood up, just as her legs began to wobble. Charlotte’s breath got heavy, and I swooped in to catch her by the waist just as the medication put her to sleep again. 

I carried her back to the bedroom, tucked her in and kissed her forehead lightly. 

“You’ll remember it all, in good time.” 

Hours later, once I opened up my book to the page I left it at, I could feel that familiar sensation at the back of my neck; A prickly sensation, leaving me feeling hot and irritated. 

My conscience, reminding me that the woman in my bedroom will wake up once again, ask the same set of questions, and I’ll have yet another chance to convince her that she is Charlotte, my wife.

My dead wife that I lost many nights ago due to my drunk driving. 

I couldn’t help it, this woman, her eyes so similar to my Charlotte’s, surely it was fate that sent her my way to redeem myself. 

And maybe, if I loved, adored, and, cherished her the same way, Charlotte would be alive for longer. 

I just needed some more time."

He looked at his people, his followers. Every single one of them gave up everything to follow him. They all believed in him and gave their all but still their cause had failed. He worked to steady his breath in fear of letting the tears flow. He felt the sorrow inside swell with every passing second. He couldn't let them see, even now he was still their leader. They had lost the war against the enemy but the war to live raged on and he would not fail them twice. As the winds blew against the sand he saw in the distance a silhouette form against the horizon. he squinted his eyes and walked towards the shape as if drawn by its power. Massive gates stood before him, somehow ancient and worn. He felt something inside of him, something he had never felt before. the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, his heart raced and he felt the urge to run as far away as he could. He had faced his father, the greatest force in the universe, and only now did he know fear. He trembled as he stepped back and turned to the sky. His gaze setting upon a single star in the heavens. He had never heard of anything inhabiting this place. He was one of the first beings in creation, yet this gate seemed ancient even to him. A single thought crept into his mind. What could be older than him and perhaps even his father, and why was he so afraid of it he would stay so far away from it. His fixation and silence was interrupted by a knock. Lucifer pulled his gaze from the silver city and back to the gate before him. He had fought and lost against the creator, but for the first time, he felt fear as the knocks grew louder."

Sorry, got a little mad there. 


I made a little game out of it. If I saw one on the ground, I stomped it. If I caught one in a cup, I’d throw it in the microwave and zap it. If I caught one in a glue trap, I’d grab a snack and watch it slowly starve. 


You may call be a sociopath, you’re probably right, but again, fuck wasps. 

Some species lay their eggs in living hosts, so that they can hatch inside the body and eat the host from the inside, keeping them alive as long as possible. 


I can’t imagine a worse death, anything that starts life out like that HAS to be a trash animal, right? 


I noticed a nest forming outside my patio. Fuck. I got some gas and knocked them out, then brought them inside for the fun to begin. I got a look from a neighbor wearing a weird hoodie, but shrugged it off. 


Wasp venom is actually capable of paralzying some prey. I’m not sure how much it would take to stunt a person, but I think they’d go into shock first. Little assholes can’t even fight a proper duel, they just make their prey weak and then torment them. 


I came home from work after buying a lighter and some twine, I had planned a “witch pyre” death, for some of the remaining wasps from the nest. I put the container I kept them in inside the refrigerator, to make them fall asleep first, before I felt a sharp pain in my neck.


Shit! One of them must have gotten out. I reached up to slap my neck but my arm didn’t move. My legs gave out and I crashed to the floor.


I could only stare in a daze at my neighbor, only he didn’t look like himself. His eyes were compound, and his mouth had pincers coming out of it.


I woke up on my bed later, tied down to my bed. An IV was stuck in my arm, and my neighbor stood up, as if he’d been waiting. 


“You made them hurt.” The words came out in a weird click, but I understood them somehow. “They cried out for me for so long. I am finally here.” Wasps crawled out of his arms and legs, jabbing their stingers into me. 


“My children. Bhramari loves you all.” He grinned. I whimpered as I felt hundreds of little needles jab into me. 


I woke up in a daze to an empty apartment, still tied down, IV still inserted. I tried to move, but the straps were tight and I was weak from the stings. My body felt itchy all over, and I wanted to scratch so badly. 


Then I noticed a bump moving in my arm, under the skin. 


They hadn’t just stung me.


They had laid their eggs in me. "

I rubbed my eyes and adjusted them to the darkness. My wife was no longer next to me. 

“Daddy!” I heard my son holler. “Mommy is in here with me!”

I got out of bed and started walking to Jack’s room. The door was opened only a creak, I pushed it open and immediately ran to the garbage can. I hurled my insides out. My wife was laying in bed, or rather her body was. She lay there without a head to lay on the pillow. 

I walked back in, sobbing, looking over at Jack. It wasn’t Jack. Thousands of bugs crawled around the bed, chirping, making noises. The noises sounded almost human. Then they said only a few words. 

“Can you read a story to me daddy?” 

I felt my body getting weaker and suddenly I collapsed. My body felt tingly, as if bugs were crawling all over me. I managed to squint, looking at my chest. ‘Jack’ was on top of me, it asked the same question, only this time, it’s voice deepened. 

“Can you read a story to me daddy?”

Then I remembered. I didn’t have a son.."

Smoking what feels this last cigarette. Looking out into the gloomy cloudy sky. The dark patchy sky seemed to last for months. Patches of sunlight gently warming the ground around the neighborhood but it seems to miss his house completely.

Sitting in his best black suit he's had for years. For ""special occasions"" his wife and daughter would say and there would be none more of a special occasion than today. 

He stands up as they slowly walk in. Dressed in all black just like him. Trying his hardest to gather the courage to talk to her grieving family. None would take his hand or even lend him their ear. 

Looking at those lovely faces. All for his wife and daughter. His tears, gathering in his right eye. Thinking about the argument and car crash that brought him here. Couldn't even remember what the argument was about, he did remember her being on that ventilator barely alive. Tubes and lines throughout her body. When the doctors came and told him about his daughter. He couldn't let his daughter go alone. Against his better judgement he agreed with the doctors and let his wife go.

Apologizing for the loss, but no one would listen. As he tried excruciatingly to be forgiven. Time after time ignored. Even his own brother passed him by. Not like he could blame him. He walked back to the framed picture of his wife and daughter. 
 Looking at the photo of both, his daughter on her lap. Full of smiles and sunshine. He lightly scoffed while looking at the ground, taking another drag of his cigarette. 

He looked back at all the people who loved them and felt sad that he couldn't face them.  All of them wondering where he is. He should be here to celebrate their lives. Her sister's telling stories of his wife's college days. Her mother reminding them it's his wife's thirty second birthday, is today. His brother's talking about how his niece never had the flu, rarely a cold as a baby. His father's telling everyone how she was the smartest fourth graders in their school. They began to laugh at the joy those two brought. After some time they wondered where he was. It was his house after all. They began to call his name and looked around for him.

He's not far. Taking a drag from his cigarette. Unable to go inside his house. His body in the basement. Hanging in his best suit, just for special occasions."

I've been noticing recently that there's been a bit of an uptick in stories which are primary sad or depressing rather than scary or thrilling. Please remember, stories on /r/ShortScaryStories must focus on being scary. Elements of other genres like fantasy, science fiction, comedy, romance, blah blah blah, are certainly welcome, but the sole focus of the story must be to scare. 

Normally, I try to keep a hands-off approach to the stories on this subreddit. Horror, of course, is subjective. What scares me may not scare you. What scares you, may not scare me. I trust the readership will report stories which don't fit or violate the rules. I also trust them to upvote stories they find scary. Of course, I will continue to remain as hands-off as possible.

Please try to remember, stories involving suicide, drug addiction, mental illness, depression, losing loved ones, and the many other issues plaguing human existence, while they can be used as a theme, should not be the sole focus on the horror."

I squint at my computer screen. The link I just clicked brought up a google streetview of the house I grew up in. Apparently a Google car had surprised my parents and me under our porch at breakfast during the summer holidays. I can’t remember such a car ever driving through our neighbourhood, but there is no denying that it’s freckles-and-ponytail 16 years old me in the picture, alongside my mom and dad. I smile; I can nearly smell the pancakes, the dew and the coffee.

**It’s my old house. What do u mean? What window?** I type back.

***Kitchen window***

I squint harder. There is indeed a man’s face looking at us from the kitchen, but I don’t recognize him. Did we ever receive the visit of a lone man? We sometimes had other families over, whose children I played with; or work colleagues of my mom; or even my father’s poker pals. But there never was a single man staying the night, and having breakfast with us. Who was he?

***Do u have a brother?***

**No.**

Well, that’s half the truth. I had an older brother, but he had died two years before I was born. My parents seldom talked about him. I had to grow out of childhood to understand that the sullen atmosphere in my house wasn’t normal; that the warmth had gone with *him*; that I had been conceived as a last chance for my parents to have something to live for. I didn’t think myself unhappy as a child, but it took me a few years of therapy and a couple of confrontations with my parents to get them to open about *him*, to understand that it wasn’t my fault; that they had already brought up a child, already lived through the laughter and tears, already experienced loss. It wasn’t my fault that I was a rerun, born ten years too late to fill someone else’s place.

***Is it your brother?!!? Look closer.***

And as I type “no”, I look  out of instinct. That face in the kitchen is familiar yet unknown, but I hadn’t noticed: It’s not looking at us having breakfast anymore. It’s looking at the camera from the windows. *It’s looking at me*.

***Is it your brother??!!***

**Who are you?** I answer frantically.

I thought I had recognized the alias of an old friend when the chatbox had opened, but the truth I have no idea who this person is.

***Who is that at the door??!!***

Another link in the chatbox. I click it in a spasm. It’s a google streetview of a house in some suburbs. A man is waiting at the front door, his back to the camera.

***Is it your brother?***

This my house. The house I’m sitting in right now. This is my front door.

***It is your brother?***

I’m shaking.

***It’s me sister***

I think I’m crying.

***I’m coming in***

I hear the door creak as it opens."

It's awful. No confirmation, yet no rejection. Stuck in true limbo, until you either come to the conclusion they have no spark or just didn't see the text, but it's too awkward to follow up.  

The reason I mention this is Will. Will is my new roommate, a normal guy, nothing impressive about him, but he had fallen for Amy. Hard.  

He'd met her at a party I'd brought him to, but he didn't have the confidence to mention it right there and then. He'd waited, tried to get to know her, until he finally got her number.  

Just yesterday, he texted her a relatively innocuous text about hanging out, maybe eventually mentioning his feelings to her.  

No response.  

He's been waiting, agonizing over every minute she isn't replying, trying to understand what she could mean. Did she miss the text? Did she mean to reply but forgot? Was it that he was too bland? Did she just hate him?   

Will doesn't know I saved him. Amy was no good for him. I'd known her for a while, and she'd leave him in a heartbeat, probably get angry because he was too possessive, because he was controlling, because she just couldn't deal with him any more, for no good reason just because she thought he was cheating on her, but who could blame this guy! She was just so...stifling, and I..., I mean, this hypothetical Joe in the future, just would be left over nothing.  

But something tells me she won't ever respond back. I just hope Joe doesn't start wondering about the new dirt pile in the back."

Bobby, that’s my younger brother, Bobby, he even hated her. Mommy too I think. I could see it on her face when she held the bucket. She didn’t like it *at all*. I think she even puked a little.

And it was pretty yucky, I gotta say. Janine was all squishy and liquidy when she lived in the bottom of the bucket, and when she screamed it sounded like when you're choking, all gurgly and flemmy. My mom tried to get her out of there with a stick, but she just dripped down into it again.

Bobby said she had a weird and ugly face, but I figured it was because she was so runny?

We had to take her. That’s what the men said. Everybody on our street got a bucket, and we all had to take care of the babies in them.

Mommy had to feed her twice daily, before she got big and could eat meat. They were very strict about that. Back then I didn’t understand why the milk was so red, and mommy wouldn’t really tell me either. She always cried when she did it though, I remember that.

Bobby told me I looked pale. He always said mean things like that.

Janine grew fast, and soon enough the bucket started running over with Janine. We had to scoop her up several times every day, and she always kinda stuck to your fingers, like warm slime. It was pretty gross.

Bobby told me I looked so thin, that I might as well be a skeleton. Haha, very funny Bobby, I just said.

One day Janine’s head swelled over the bucket, and her scrawny neck couldn’t support it so well, so she tipped over the bucket, and it fell on the floor. I could see then that she had super tiny arms and legs, and then she sort of started to swim around in herself. 

Bobby told me to get lost. Mommy said she couldn’t remember why she kept me around.

Then came the day when mommy called my name, and I came running, and she just stared at me like she didn’t know me.

Who are you? she said.

It’s me, Janine, I said.

Then Bobby came, and he said the same thing, who are you? I am Janine, I said. But Bobby just shook his head. No, you ain’t, he said. That’s Janine, and then he pointed to Janine. Janine, the other Janine, didn’t even look like me, I thought. She was still all runny and sticky and swimming in herself.

But they couldn’t see it.

So now I live in the forest, with the other kids who have bucket baby sisters and brothers. I don’t really know how it works, but if the men ever come to you and say you have to take care of a bucket baby? Well, if you ask me,

I say you probably shouldn’t."

There was this GIANT tree that we found close to our house, it had some holes in it but we couldn’t see inside. We continued hiking till it got dark. We decided to stop for a short toilet break. Alex went into the bushes and started and I and mom started talking about the day when we realised Alex was taking too long. mom went to check in on them when Alex came from the bushes and asked where mom was. We went searching for her calling her name but she did not reply. We got worried but found mom near the tree. her bag was missing but we just went straight home to rest.

The circumstances of a disappearance are usually pretty straightforward: *“Person is there; person isn’t there; some sicko, disturbed parent, or jealous lover nabbed them.”* 

The cops said Riley got nabbed by a sicko. A year later, she was declared dead. But Riley’s disappearance *was* odd. I know because I was there. 

Riley and I met in math class our junior year and quickly hit it off. Butterflies took flight from my stomach when Riley invited me to Sadie Hawkins. In our rural town, it was sacrilege. Two girls going to a school dance together, especially when it’s more than a friendship, is a tough steer for cowpokes to wrangle. 

I always wondered if we made enemies during Sadie Hawkins, if somehow that explained Riley’s disappearance. But eventually, I let myself believe the truth. It was much more sinister than that.

Throughout our junior year, Riley and I continued falling in love. We loved being outside together. We went hiking regularly. There was a reservoir on the outskirts of our town –– Brandon Lake. Trails led all around it. It was so wooded that getting lost was easy. 

Riley and I became hopelessly lost the night she disappeared. Darkness fell. The moon rose, but we were deep in the woods. It was impossible to see. 

We freaked out when we heard bushes rustle; then, when we heard voices, the real terror started. 

*Come with us…*

*We want to study you…*

*We want to see what your insides look like…*

The forest flooded with blue light. Cyclonic winds began beating down. Riley and I hauled ass in the general direction of the parking lot. I was faster than Riley. She wasn’t much of an athlete. She lagged behind, branching off into the woods to avoid being caught on the path.

Seconds later, I heard a scream and saw a final flash of light. The swirling wind stopped. The silence of night descended just as suddenly. When I went back to look for Riley, I saw the odd thing. It was her footprints –– one foot in front of the next, long, running strides, then a final footprint before they disappeared. The last footprint was deeper than the others, as if she’d bounded once before floating away into space.

The search went on for weeks. The cops grilled me: “Could Riley have run away from home? Did she have any enemies because of her *life choices*?” No one cared about the footprints or my theory that Riley had been taken by something inhuman.

Ten years have passed. In private moments, I remember Riley’s disappearance: her haunting scream; the lights and wind stopping suddenly; her final footprint cast in mud. 

And on clear, quiet nights when I look up at the stars, I hear voices: 

*Come with us…*

*We want to study you…*

*We want to see what your insides look like…*

I truly loved Riley Fletcher. For her sake, I hope it ended quickly."

Then people started to be missing, and 2 people were missing per week than 3, then 4, then missing one person each day.

We don’t know where they have gone to or why they are disappearing.

But now they are coming back all of them, but they didn’t walk or run here, cause they came from above. 

All the people that were missing began to fall from the sky hitting the ground, roof, falling off buildings, and people, And I call the ones that fall from the sky the ”fallen”

Our town began to become red real quick and we were afraid to go outside cause we don’t want to know what God has sent. 

Then it restarted, cause now new people come to our town and those people began to be missing and then every 2 weeks they begin to fall. 

And I have been keeping track of who is missing who will next, cause they began to fall again last night, but it was different this time because I saw my best friend falling from his dead. 

Maybe she was already dead before she hit rock bottom, and it sad because I never told her about my feeling for her bad timing I guess.

I call this the “Rain” well the rain of humans or course literally. 

I don't know why this is happening or how this is even possible, but each time it rains it gets messer and messer, but somehow all fallen body form before always seem to be gone before our visitors come and then its stock up.

I think I will videotape the next raining before my neighbor sees me falling from heaven we'll if there is one."

I said I wasn't afflicted, but she didn't seem to care. Claimed I'd be paid for my time.

""Like one of those research studies,"" the woman, going by the name of Madelyn, said.

The back of her van was padded, with a single camera in the corner.

Since the reward promised to be quite substantial, I agreed to take a mild sedative. I sorely needed the money, so trust was irrelevant.

Before I knew it, she had strapped to a gurney staring at the padded walls. Madelyn said not to worry about a thing.

""You'll be fine as long as you go with the flow,"" Madelyn whispered.

But then she started to change. As she began to carve into my flesh, her weird sadistic smile growing, a lumpy mass began to expand on her face and arms. It was as if the pain she was causing me caused her to turn into a monster.

Terror built in me like some sort of fever dream, but I knew the things that were happening to me were quite real.

I continued to stare at her face as she ""operated"" on me, and the ugly mass started to spread even more and become darker, and I think at some point my sanity ""cracked"" a little bit.

Afterwards, she pumped me full of antibiotics and handed me a wad of cash.

""What did you do to me?"" I asked.

""Don't worry, they won't harm you. As long as you do what I say,"" Madelyn told me. She brushed my neck gently.

""They?""

""I've placed them inside you to monitor your thoughts and reactions to things.""

""But I didn't give you permission,"" I replied.

""Science doesn't need permission,"" came her retort.

I had no choice but to live with the things she placed inside me.

That night, I had dreams of Madelyn and the weird growth on her face and arms. I woke up in a cold sweat, shirt clinging to moist skin.

Madelyn was standing in my room, just watching me as the lightning flashed in the large window behind her.

""I do love my babies,"" Madelyn talked in a quiet voice. ""I invented them years ago. I place them in my subjects, and I instantly know when they fall asleep. I can sneak in their homes and watch them as they writhe in torment. If science is to progress, the subject's privacy can't be considered. Don't you agree?""

I didn't know what to say. Her babies were inside me, potentially controlling my bodily functions.

I was at their mercy."
k4yeyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k4yeyf/terror/,Terror,17,2,1606870208.0,"It’s dark as your eyes open, you can’t move, no matter how hard you try, you cannot get your arms to lift. Something has them pinned - you think. It seems like you can wiggle your fingers and squirm your body, but nothing changes. 

It’s quiet, except for the soft hum coming from somewhere near you. 

It sounds like a lullaby, hummed so softly the woman’s voice fades in and out. Your breathing is shallow and rapid, a metallic copper taste lacing your tongue, making you thirsty. 

A soft breeze caresses your cheek, and you smell sweet and earthy scents of lavender and sandalwood.

Swallowing thickly you realize that coppery tang in your mouth is blood. Panic fills you as you question whether it is your own, beginning to squirm to see if any specific body part hurts or feels like it’s bleeding. 

That lullaby is starting to sound almost identifiable; you seem unharmed. Are you laying flat? Or is that breeze your body swaying in midair? You can’t figure it out, having your sight taken away has confused your balance and equilibrium. Your senses seem muffle, sluggish. 

In the distance you hear something, it sounds like fabric being torn. Or is it being stitched? You hear the poke of a needle through cloth and the slow friction of thread being pulled through; it repeats itself as if time has slowed. 

Now, all you can concentrate on is that lullaby and the sound of stitching. You try to ignore the sound of your panicked breath and the sound of your heart pumping blood through your veins at an alarmingly fast pulse. It reminds you of the ocean, as the waves aggressively hit a cliff, breaking against the rocks. 

Something cold, like metal, has touched your abdomen, pulling you from your envisioned paradise. You begin to realize that it’s not fabric the thread is being pulled through. A sharp, fiery, stinging sensation shoots like a bolt up through your abdomen, and you gasp, feeling a gentle tugging along your flesh. 

You hadn’t noticed it before, but your body had been numb. 

The humming sounds more like it’s right next to you; fingers brush something from your stomach; it feels cold and wet. Or is it hot and fiery?

A scream gurgles in your throat when you see the glint of a needle being pulled up from your midsection. You writhe in terror only to find out you’re chained to a ceiling of some kind, suspended fully in the air."

Stalagmites and stalactites slice into the hazy aqua waters like menacing fangs; I'm a helpless prey to this forsaken cave- this labyrinth of winding tunnels interlocking with another; they're all dead ends. They seem to lead to everywhere, yet nowhere at all.

Discarded masks sneer from the sandy floors. Abandoned sheers warn of the danger of getting snagged, while powerless flashlights foreshadow the darkness ahead. Preserved bones of lost divers haunt the hollows. What were their names? How long had they lied trapped in this oceanic prison?  None of the bodies had been identified, and no recoveries would be made, due to the danger of retrieving them.

One particular body distinguished itself among the rest- a terribly decayed, headless corpse still wearing a wetsuit. His gear had become snagged upon a protrusion along the cave ceiling. His gear restricted his flexibility, and he was unable to cut himself free. Now, his lifeless body suspended from the cupola like a uvula.

I wonder if his family ever knew what had happened to him? What was it like for their families to know that their beloved was lost forever in the belly of a cave? To have an empty casket for the funeral? Was there any closure?

Perhaps they were like me; perhaps they had nobody to mourn them at all. I'll become another nameless, faceless skeleton. Scavengers will pick the flesh clean and scatter my bones throughout the cave. I'll be like the midnight fog, evaporating before the world has awaken. And they'll live on. I'm a dissipating breath.

My air- it's so low. Perhaps only 40 minutes worth. That's hardly enough to safely ascend to the ocean's surface. How can I navigate this labyrinth in time? Am I navigating my way to safety, or wondering deeper into desolation?

No! The lantern is dimming. It's dark! So dark. The only remaining comfort died in my hands, and loneliness has taken its place. The cold, complete isolation blackens all reason. There is no comfort anymore. No color for the eye to rest upon. No calmness in these eerily still waters.

Every fear rises from my subconscious like serpents slithering from the deepest ocean trenches. Every sense is cloaked in inescapable ambiguity. I have no body. Just a shapeless consciousness leaking into these endless waters. There's no way out.

It started as a normal day - I woke up, took a shower, got dressed, had breakfast and made my way to work. It was a hard day, but I got through it. When evening came, I could finally go home. Unfortunately it didn't go as planned. As I was making my way back home, I noticed a black van parked next to the office building. I didn't think much of it until I saw that same van near my house. I knew something was off, so I didn't go home that night. Instead, I called one of my friends - George, and decided to stay the night with him. As I was going to his house, I felt a sudden pain in my neck. Someone had shot me with a tranquilizer dart. The last thing I saw was that same black van that had followed me home.

I woke up tied to a chair with nothing but a light coming from above me to light the room. Then I heard an ominous voice coming from the shadows. It said:""You owe me, Bill. You owe me a lot."" I didn't recognise that voice at first, but then I realised - It was George's twin brother Mike. Despite being twins, they looked very different from each other. ""George told me that you're afraid of spiders,"" Mike said, ""how pathetic!"" then he finally came out of the shadows holding four glass boxes of two different sizes. ""Two for the legs and two for the arms,"" he said. ""What?"" I asked him, ""what do you mean?"" He just laughed. Mike untied one of my legs and put it in one of the big boxes. I tried resisting and kicking him, but he was too strong. Then he put my other leg in a box. Then when he tried putting one of my arms if a box, I successfully punched him, but accidentally toppled over the chair and when my head hit the ground, I fell unconscious. I woke up again, this time strapped to a table with all of the boxes on my arms and legs. I couldn't move. Then I saw Mike again, this time he had someone with him. That someone introduced herself to me as Blaire, an arachnologist. Then she took out a jar full of spiders. ""GET THAT SHIT THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, YOU BITCH!"" I screamed. ""What would be the fun in that?"" she asked me. Then she opened a little hatch in one of the boxes and poured all of the spiders in it. I screamed in agony as I felt the spiders' fangs pierce my skin. ""I'm not done yet,"" Blaire said, ""You still have three boxes left, Bill"" Then she took out another jar of spiders and poured them in another one of the boxes. I continued screaming as I felt the spider venom slowly spread through me. As she took out a third jar, someone kicked open the door in the room. I don't know what happened next, because I lost consciousness a third time.

I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't feel either of my legs. I looked over at where my legs should be, but... They weren't there. They had been amputated. I completely lost my breath. I noticed someone standing next to my bed. ""Please... Let... Me... Die..."" was the last thing I said before I started hearing the heartrate monitor speed up until I couldn't hear anything at all. ""Am I dead?"" I thought to myself, ""Is this it?"" Then I started to hear a woman crying. I reawoke in the bed with doctors standing around it. I was still alive. Unfortunately."

**Incident Title:** ""Heaven Stairway"" Incident A

**Incident Description:** The rain that fell between 9:02 AM - 2:39 PM EST in New York City displays no unusual characteristics upon further examination. However, the objects that emerged from the clouds during that time period continue to have no proper explanation.

When the rain first began, the bodies did not immediately appear from the clouds; however, appearances of bodies appearing began to exponentially increase, raining from the sky from an unknown source. Observation from above the clouds shows no sign of where the bodies have appeared from, implying they came from the clouds themselves.

The bodies hitting the ground continued for nearly 5 hours until it abruptly stopped, corpses covering every square inch of the city's surface. The bodies themselves appear human, aside from grotesquely stretched mouths to form a grin on strangely wrinkled faces. Every corpse that came from the sky also has limbs far too long for their bodies, with a lack of elbows/knees giving them a limp figure similar to spaghetti.

Every body is covered head-to-toe with a reddish yellow substance similar to motor oil, but there is no clear source where this could have come from either. 

**Incident Aftermath:** The surrounding area was put into a panic for a variety of reasons. Aside from the general pandemonium from the falling corpses, many have reported that they recognized the bodies as people who went missing or died in the 2010s; however, every single body collected since the incident is freshly dead, making this accusation close to impossible.

The oily substance latching itself onto the corpses have also reportedly splashed onto nearly everyone outside at the time, and although the substance appears to be harmless, it seems impossible to fully wash off. Citizens exposed to small splashes have been told to quarantine, while others exposed to large splashes have been taken into custody.

W.I.P.; more to be added.

**Incident Description:** Between 3:19 AM and 8:49 AM EST in New York City, it rained once again.

We chatted for hours until I suggested that she comes over to my apartment for the night. Her face lit up and she immediately said yes. We decided to walk as it was only 5 minutes away and I loaned her my jacket when she said she was cold.

She went to use the bathroom when we reached my apartment, so I went and got myself ready and grabbed my weapon of choice.

We started kissing on the couch and she began slowly kissing down my neck. She let out an inhuman scream, when the holy water I had applied to my neck began to burn her mouth. While she was momentarily distracted I grabbed my wooden stake out of my pocket and jammed it into her heart.

Her body began to convulse before slowly turning to dust, leaving only two sharp canine teeth behind. I picked up the teeth and threw them into the drawer with the dozens of others. I looked at the mess that she had left behind before grabbing the hoover and cleaning it off."

I started doing some bumps in the way to a friend's apartment. I almost ran up the stairs all excited for all the drugs I was gonna do, if you've ever been addicted to anything, you'll understand the feeling. 

We started doing some lines, popped up some xanax, drinked a little. I smoked a little weed mixed with crack which made me anxious, I started hearing voices, which was not unusual, but I was still having fun and time was flying by. My friend went to bed and I didn't sleep at all.

At about 6 in the morning I woke her up in a panic. 

""Dude, my parents are outside, I can hear them, clean all this shit please"", I said.

""What are you talking about? That's impossible, they don't know where you are. Take some more xanax and go to sleep, I have work in a few hours.""

Of course I didn't listen. I did another two lines, I went and looked out of the peephole and what I saw I could not describe. Coming out of the closet outside the apartment I saw a brown silhouette, I don't know what it was, but I swear it wasn't human. 

I continued to do drugs because that's what I was used to do, until my friend left to go to work. I went outside to have a smoke, when I came back, the shadow people were everywhere I went, in the closets, in the cabinets, in the bathrooms, everywhere, just waiting for me, hiding in the darkness. I peaked under the bed, a shining pair of eyes looked at me, ""hello"" it said, then it got out and took off running upstairs. I followed.

At this moment my heart was pounding like crazy. The shadow led me to the 3rd floor patio of the apartment. Then it suddenly jumped. I finished the last of my grams, ""one for the road"" I thought. 

At the distance I could hear footsteps. I knew the shadow people were coming for me. I knew there was only one thing for me to do to get away from them. I looked from where the silhouette had jumped before, all I could see was a dark abyss. I had no choice. I jumped.

I woke up in the hospital the next day. I had some broken bones but somehow I was still alive. The thing is, I still see them. They still look at me with those shining eyes, they still hide from me everywhere I go. They have no mouth, but they speak to me. I swear, seeing them it's greater than torture. They make me wish I hadn't survived."

The conductor. Lifts his baton, an army of music awaiting him at his beck and call.

Tock.

The adventurer. Wanders into a neighbourhood where his life is in peril.

Tick.

The deadbeat. Stumbles home drunk from a night that he'll remember for the rest of his life.

Tock.

He breaks into his own house, where his wife and children sleep. They'll sleep forever more.

Tick.

A shadow emerges, stalking the man as he walks in the dark. His end is near.

Tock.

He swishes the stick down, and the orchestra plays in a unity of song as the audience watches on in a silent awe.

Tick.

He builds up the pace now, and the instruments join into the start of a frenzied climax.

Tock.

Held up by a gun, he fancies his chances and tussles with the man dressed in black. This day he fights for his life.

Tick.

He fumbles with booze and a necklace, drinking away to his deathbed. But that's not enough. It's never enough.

Tock.

He wears it snugly, clutching his neck with a killer grip that will become his funeral attire. He joins his family.

Tick.

It's a lost battle. He falls to the ground as the killler points the gun at his head. The shadow's now red.

Tick.

As his hands flail around madly, the conductor's heart beats hard like a drum. Another noise into the pile.

Tock.

The crescendo roars, the gun fires, the people die..

And the clock ticks on."
k4op0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k4op0f/a_new_start/,A New Start,84,3,1606841479.0,"   When my ex-wife first mentioned the word divorce, I thought that would be the end of me. We were married for eight years and, to be honest, I never considered what it would be like to carry on without her. My therapist said ""divorce can be a new start"" and ""men often find themselves feeling free after divorce.""

   At the time, I discounted that as total junk. However, over time, those phrases kept coming back to me. I could finally have a couple of beers after dinner without ""I think you're drinking too much."" I could finally smoke in the house without ""it reeks in here."" I can eat whatever I want without ""you're going to get fat."" Sure, I miss her, but there's something to be said for being able to live like a bachelor again, doing what I want when I want.

   Of course, best of all are the women. My apartment has become a revolving door of blonds, brunettes, and redheads. Before I went through divorce, my wife and I always had completely vanilla tastes as far as the bedroom is concerned. Divorce really gave me the freedom to explore what I like in bed, and I gradually found out that I'm into things that I never would've been able to do with my wife.

&#x200B;

   To be honest, sometimes I can almost still hear ""you're tracking dirt all over the carpet,"" ""the bed sheets are covered in grave fluid,"" or even ""God, what have you done?"" when I bring home my latest catch. However, divorce has given me the freedom to ignore those complaints, pick up my shovel, and find someone new as soon as the smell gets unbearable or the flesh sloughs off. Divorce was sad at first, but when I feel the excitement of snuggling up with someone new and feeling their cold arms around me, I wouldn't have it any other way."
k4nzbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k4nzbf/baby_talk/,Baby Talk,817,39,1606839411.0,"Amanda was reading on the couch, sipping her wine, when a rustle caught her attention. She looked up from her book to see her one and a half year old, Zach, standing at the bottom of the stairs. 

“Hi, Zach-y,” she said, as happily as her tired self could muster.

Zach looked her dead in the eye, and said, “Amanda.”

That caused her to stop. She had never heard her son refer to her by her real name– it was always Mommy, or Mama. She put the book down. “Are you okay, Zach? Did you have a nightmare?”

He toddled closer, and pointed a finger at her. “Amanda.”

The repetition actually sent a shiver down her spine. “Zach? What’s wrong?” She wondered whether this was an early sign of mental illness. What toddler referred to their mother by her real name? It almost wasn’t *human*. 

“Amanda, Amanda,” he insisted, pointing. He ran up to the couch and climbed up on her lap. She embraced him, trying not to let her son see her primal fear, as she faintly wondered what she had given birth to. 

“*Amanda*,” her son said again, shaking her sleeve to get her attention. Again, he pointed: not at her, but over her shoulder. She turned around. 

*Oh*, Amanda thought, just before the knife plunged in. *A man there.*"

k4m1t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/k4m1t2/our_marriage_is_being_managed_by_reddit_users/,Our marriage is being managed by Reddit users,1358,55,1606833570.0,"Hey guys got a bit of a problem and basically my marriage to my wife is being managed by Reddit users. It started off innocently when me and my wife wanted to know whether we were being ass holes to each other for certain things like with money, in-laws and children. I guess there is always a point in our marriage where me and my wife aren't sure how to solve something and so we ask Reddits on sub-reddits like Reddit relationships, am I the ass hole and many more. 

Sometimes Reddits were in my favour and other times they were in the favour of my wife, but all in all we felt comfortable letting strangers manage our marriage sometimes. Having unbiased opinion can be a positive sometimes. 

Now here is where it's gets weirder and whenever the Reddit users were on my side, I would gain actual powers like being able to move things with my mind and even physical strength. This is the same for my wife when Reddit users were on her side. It's like when Reddit users were siding on one person, it gave powers to the individual as a right of way to use it to help their cause if they found it worthy. 

Problems started arising when I started noticing that we were relying on Reddit users a bit too much to manage our marriage. My wife though seemed to only like Reddit users more as they were mostly in her favour most of the time. 

Then my wife started asking me nicely whether she could murder me or burn me alive. I would shout back at her and she would resort to going on Reddit again and telling them that she had asked me nicely if she could do something and I had replied with anger. My wife kept on asking me very nicely of course whether she could do more horrid things to me like poison me or stab me and my reaction was the same. 

She would go to Reddit and the user's acting as judges would be against me. Reading all of the comments it was quite worrying. They wouldn't hear my side as my wife gained quite a few followers. They wouldn't hear me out and I suffer from bad grammar and I struggle to explain things. My wife keeps pointing to Reddit and how they are in her favour and that I should do anything she asks me to do, when she says it nicely. 

She also now has powers to help her cause. I'm writing this on a new sub Reddit to gain support and powers on my end to fight back."
