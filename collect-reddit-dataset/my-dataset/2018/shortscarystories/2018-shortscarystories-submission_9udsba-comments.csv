e94bnbt,t3_9udsba,"The ending confused me, someone please explain",t3_9udsba
e94hlhe,t3_9udsba,"Love the idea and the concept.

There's one problem I've found in your writing, however, you describe things too much. You seem to go into unnecessary details and that may get boring for some people.

But I liked the story anyway!",t3_9udsba
e947nnu,t3_9udsba,"Thanks, OP. This surprisingly put everything into perspective now. Would LOVE to get to know you!",t3_9udsba

e9wxkwc,t3_9udsba,I don't get the last part,t3_9udsba
e94b37k,t3_9udsba,The bitch got what she deserved,t3_9udsba
e93sjsd,t1_e93romf,"Thank you, glad to hear that my crime gave you thrills.",t3_9udsba
e93wgqi,t1_e93u3tp,"Cheers mate, I was surprised myself too.",t3_9udsba
e93wxr8,t1_e93wryp,"I'm just worried, that the assassin might have double-crossed me. ",t3_9udsba
e93yo4p,t1_e93y709,"Thank you. I know, my life is just full of surprises.",t3_9udsba
e93xclp,t1_e93x32n,Thank you for the support,t3_9udsba
e93ymqf,t1_e93xysx,Thank you for the compliment,t3_9udsba
e94egv5,t1_e94bnbt,"Basically, instead of the assassin the guy hired to kill the cheating girlfriend of his, someone else came and killed her.",t3_9udsba
e94hso3,t1_e94hlhe,"Oh I know, I do waffle on quite a bit. I'm still getting used to writing shorter stories. Thanks for the advices.",t3_9udsba
e94805r,t1_e947nnu,First rule: No cheating. Deal?,t3_9udsba
e947xno,t1_e947ksn,"I hope so anyway. Though if he comes to me demanding money, I don't really have any evidence to show that he didn't kill her. ",t3_9udsba
e95nse7,t1_e95n2w7,I basically wasted money hiring an useless assassin who couldn't even kill on time. Someone else donned on a mask and did it first. ,t3_9udsba
e94rxab,t1_e94du4x,The guy he hired saw his GF with another man which is prolly that guy who decapitated her live online in front of the writer.,t3_9udsba
e95npck,t1_e95n8it,Thanks a lot mate,t3_9udsba
e94hkd6,t1_e93wxr8,[deleted],t3_9udsba
e94hpfb,t1_e94egv5,"Ohhhh, that's a nice plot twist",t3_9udsba
e94roe2,t1_e94hso3,"I‚Äôd say something similar - really almost only prior to the first twist, you could cut some things down or out! But still, a good fun story! And also maybe slightly tease that first twist, since it isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbig‚Äù one? ",t3_9udsba
e978640,t1_e94hso3,I have no idea what they are talking about. You were quite to the point. The people in this sub gives some terrible advice and seem to think their random musings are objective fact. ,t3_9udsba
e948gcc,t1_e94805r,Deal! Promise me the same?,t3_9udsba
e94ikol,t1_e94hkd6,"He could have been the actual killer, but pretended to not be and probably had recorded the call, which would mean he can get out of the crime if I ever turn him in. But he still gets the money, because she is dead, and I can't exactly argue to terms of contract with him in a court of law, let alone the fact that I have no evidence of him not being the killer to void the contract. ",t3_9udsba
e97pyet,t1_e978640,"I appreciate all advices given to me. It might be too long for some, but just right for others like yourself. So don't worry, it's all good. Thank you for the support.",t3_9udsba
e948i8q,t1_e948gcc,Don't they always say that. Pffft.,t3_9udsba
e9499n3,t1_e948i8q,Please go straight to the point. Promise or not?,t3_9udsba
e94d07p,t1_e9499n3,Promise. Now what's your Skype?,t3_9udsba
e95mqdd,t1_e94d07p,Good story tho op,t3_9udsba
