eaoe5nq,t3_a107um,omg I LOVE this story what a badass read! Your description of the cannibalism/murder/freak who can't stop smiling was so creepy but bringing in WEREWOLVES??? yeah boiiii,t3_a107um
eam7a2e,t3_a107um,Awesome!!!,t3_a107um
ebm7775,t3_a107um,"I love your writing.

Found a spelling and grammatical error, ""Histerically laughing."" should be either ""Laughing hysterically."" or ""He was laughing hysterically.""

Adverbs can be before or after a verb but in English it seems more natural to say ""laughing hysterically"" instead of ""hysterically laughing"".

Another option would be ""Hysterically, he laughed."" But that doesn't sound right for your story.

I'm overthinking it. Now, YOU'RE probably laughing hysterically.",t3_a107um

eamn6k1,t1_eals13i,"Used 'men' a lot when it should have been 'man'. Other than that, not bad.",t3_a107um
eb0ofzi,t1_eals13i,">But murder, no, we didn‘t had one yet.

Should be hadn't or haven't, either works.  (The story is amazing btw, did not see that coming!) :)",t3_a107um

eb0pbxz,t1_eb0ofzi,"Thanks, changed it.
So you are saying the hints I placed at the beginning were too subtle?",t3_a107um
eb8hcqw,t1_eb85lpp,couldn't agree more :D,t3_a107um
eb0qaj8,t1_eb0pbxz,"They were for me but, I am a bit slow sometimes. lol",t3_a107um
eb0qpih,t1_eb0qaj8,"I must admit, I would not have seen them myself, if I didn't expected them.
I try to find the perfect balance between too subtle and too much on the nose.",t3_a107um
eb0qx6c,t1_eb0qpih,"Well, it is just perfect, if you go back and reread it, you get that ""oohhhhh"" feeling. I have read a lot of your stories here, you are quite an excellent author. I look forward to more. :)",t3_a107um
