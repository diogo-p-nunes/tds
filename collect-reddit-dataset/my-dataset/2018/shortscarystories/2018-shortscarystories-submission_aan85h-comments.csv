ectgdwl,t3_aan85h,"This is such a good short story. As much as I would love to read it in a longer context, and watch it progress, I'm actually content with the length/ending of it. Good job writing it, OP!",t3_aan85h
ecu56ji,t3_aan85h,"Hey op really I liked this story! Only thing I’d mention is that coming from a medical profession (nurse) the smell of cooking bacon took me out of it a bit. I know the exact smell you are describing and it definitely doesn’t smell like bacon. It’s more of a sour, rotten smell. Not that that detail would mean much to other people but thought I’d let you know! ",t3_aan85h
ecubmgc,t3_aan85h,"But the words "" I know. And you,ll get what you deserve."" seems scary in every context. Beyond that simple thought i loved your writing and would like to see more.",t3_aan85h
ectgpob,t3_aan85h,"Great. The lack of reasons, that she is still alive is great, gives it extra chill",t3_aan85h
ectkrny,t3_aan85h,"This was the perfect amount of suspense, mystery and outright terror. Excellent economy of words within the limit. ",t3_aan85h
ecth2h0,t3_aan85h,"Oooh, there are so many questions - how did she come back to life? Why is it tumour? What will she do next? Whee will the story go? Amazing story! ",t3_aan85h
ecthjf1,t3_aan85h,So is she a ghost? Or did she 'die' and was resuscitated? ,t3_aan85h
ecuwlfi,t3_aan85h,"This is literally one of my biggest fucking fears as a new med student, except for me it's that I'll remove the wrong part of their brain",t3_aan85h
ecthj8a,t3_aan85h,"Not bad, honestly! I really loved reading this!!",t3_aan85h
ectium4,t3_aan85h,"OP, this is awesome!",t3_aan85h
ectrr0g,t3_aan85h,"Hey OP, I read this sub every day and this is one of my favorites as of recent. I think the way you set up the importance of context in horror was extremely well done and quite insightful. I would love to see this in a longer story! Keep it up. ",t3_aan85h
ecu1zn4,t3_aan85h,I’ll keep mine simple. Very nice. ,t3_aan85h
ecu756c,t3_aan85h,Someone gild this asap...!,t3_aan85h
ecuj9yl,t3_aan85h,Love it op ,t3_aan85h
ecumm1z,t3_aan85h,This is like The Telltale Heart with a parallel reality twist. Nice.,t3_aan85h
ecw6yrj,t3_aan85h,Wow you are T A L E N T E D,t3_aan85h
ecwkw4g,t3_aan85h,Great story and original too,t3_aan85h
ecyf0u0,t3_aan85h,"this certainly feeds my worst fear as a dental student. great work, OP! ",t3_aan85h
ed8ldx3,t3_aan85h,"This is a perfect little terror-nugget. Only thing I'd suggest is that there's no need to capitalize ""gastric"" nor ""wife""

But, a very well-done story!",t3_aan85h
ed93k4a,t3_aan85h,"wow, this is really good!",t3_aan85h
ecuww9u,t3_aan85h,Ok; make my pee scary,t3_aan85h
ectgsci,t1_ectgdwl,I really appreciate it! Thank you!,t3_aan85h
ecuz87p,t1_ectgdwl,"Agreed. You bring readers into your world from the very beginning, hooking them until the end. Bravo! ",t3_aan85h
ecu5y8p,t1_ecu56ji,I appreciate the feedback! Thanks!,t3_aan85h
edaii0i,t1_ecu56ji,"Eww. Sorry that you know what it smells like. 

I am not going to ask you how you know about it though",t3_aan85h
ecuj9dl,t1_ecubmgc,Unless you've been working hard and deserve that promotion and pay rise. That's not scary,t3_aan85h
ecutyev,t1_ecubmgc,"Yeah, the first part of the story is great but it’s totally irrelevant to the second part. I feel like the writer just wanted to write about the context thing and shoehorned a story in.",t3_aan85h
ectgt7s,t1_ectgpob,Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_aan85h
ectnpl9,t1_ectkrny,Thank you! I like the challenge of writing <500 word stories. Thanks for reading.,t3_aan85h
ectkgcs,t1_ecth2h0,"Thank you! I can't answer all your questions (I'm not sure there are answers to all of them), but thanks for reading!",t3_aan85h
ectkhtj,t1_ecthjf1,"I think she's close to a ghost, but I'm not sure she's either.",t3_aan85h
ectkgxz,t1_ecthj8a,Thank you! I appreciate the support!,t3_aan85h
ectkibb,t1_ectium4,Thank you! I appreciate it very much.,t3_aan85h
ectvigh,t1_ectrr0g,I really appreciate that. Glad you enjoyed this!,t3_aan85h
ecu41r8,t1_ecu1zn4,Thank you. ,t3_aan85h
ecthkgd,t1_ectgsci,Of course! Mind if I ask if you've ever considered writing for a career? Or is it just a fun past time for you?,t3_aan85h
ef8teko,t1_edaii0i,You don't have to. It's because she's a nurse,t3_aan85h
ecvjq1l,t1_ecutyev,Totally,t3_aan85h
ecur8u9,t1_ectkgcs,"Haha, that's ok, I like it better open ended - I'm just left asking so many questions that the story starts with me for a longer time. ",t3_aan85h
ecutpbh,t1_ectkhtj,Revenant?,t3_aan85h
ectkmng,t1_ecthkgd,"It is mostly just a past-time and a side hustle. I have been writing horror on this sub and r/nosleep for several years and my work is featured in a lot of podcasts and youtube channels. Someday I'd like to settle down and be a full-time fiction writer, but it is not my primary career. Thanks for asking!",t3_aan85h
ecuvpy2,t1_ecutpbh,"Those things are like cr 5 tho, he's fucked.",t3_aan85h
ecvj6t7,t1_ectkmng,"Of course! I just ask because I'd definitely be interested in reading a longer work of yours, but I'll definitely keep an eye on your account in that case. You have talent with it!",t3_aan85h
