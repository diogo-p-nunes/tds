e89tfj3,t3_9qi8co,"Does the narrator become the Devil? Is the name Mr. Phillip a reference to something? Was the priest really evil or was the narrator just confused by the voices? Regardless, take my upvote! It was a good story. ",t3_9qi8co
e89veqg,t1_e89tfj3,"Thank you so much for taking the time to read it! As for your questions:
1. That’s up for interpretation. Many of the things we do, that we consider bad or evil, often affect our self-image so maybe Mr. Phillip is the Devil, maybe he isn’t. Maybe he’s just doing what he thinks is right. 
2. Mr. Phillip is a reference to The Witch. 
3. Yes. As evil as they get. The voices are a bit harder to pin down even for me. There’s a mental break somewhere in Mr. Phillip’s past, I am confident of that. ",t3_9qi8co
