e92nzqq,t3_9u4ykf,I would love to see this as a novella. ,t3_9u4ykf

e92a6dx,t1_e929w44,"Thanks! Love me a bit of gothic horror - first effort in that genre and I was trying to blend a bit of morality tale and 'zombie horde social commentary' (not that the infected are zombies in this case, but that they have the same quality of being relentless and completely without fear). Glad to hear you enjoyed it! ",t3_9u4ykf
e935hzw,t1_e92nzqq,Thanks! I want to try writing some longer form content. The 500 word limit is good for forcing me to condense an idea but it might be fun to expand some of them further ,t3_9u4ykf
e996vuw,t1_e92nzqq,"With a bigger word count I could really go to town on a scene where a line of musket wielding soldiers are overwhelmed by a horde of emaciated, buboe ridden plague bearers. Reckon that'd be fun to write",t3_9u4ykf
