e89hzaz,t3_9qguxt,Made me think of The Giver.  Great story!,t3_9qguxt
e89wxun,t3_9qguxt,"this could be the lovechild (pun intended) of Borrasca and Handmaid’s Tale

that said, I eagerly await your novella on the subject (please)",t3_9qguxt
e89bbop,t3_9qguxt,Great story... And sad.,t3_9qguxt
e89i7tb,t3_9qguxt,"Seems like it would be easier and more cost-effective to just isolate the anti-agathic agent from the infant blood and mass-produce that. Oh, and it would be more ethical, of course.",t3_9qguxt
e8a12xl,t3_9qguxt,I like the way the narrative shows that the writer has accepted his fate and is just happy to be a cog in this horrific system.,t3_9qguxt
e8a8f51,t3_9qguxt,Dark AF mate. Fucking loved it all from the concept to the ending.,t3_9qguxt
e89x12u,t3_9qguxt,"Whoa, very cool. Bone-chilling concept. Good job.",t3_9qguxt
e89xy6o,t3_9qguxt,Please post more or expand on this!,t3_9qguxt
e8a45d8,t3_9qguxt,i is sad :(,t3_9qguxt
e8abcmz,t3_9qguxt,"My first idea after reading about the blood harvesting concept was a modern spin on Dracula - with some real life events/conspiracy elements thrown in of course. The ‘big house’ mentioned was, in my mind, just a futuristic rendering of Dracula’s castle on the hill. 

Hopefully I’ll be able to expand on the technical a bit more when I write a longer story.",t3_9qguxt
e8acm1o,t3_9qguxt,"Amazing story OP. Chill me deep inside, even though I am sitting in the middle of sunny afternoon.",t3_9qguxt
e8am82n,t3_9qguxt,"This a great start for a ""longer"" short story.

e8a6jua,t3_9qguxt,"Fully cared for for food and housing, no work other than banging and knocking up fresh new young girls on the regular, hell I'd sign up knowing all the conditions!",t3_9qguxt
e8ab8h6,t1_e89hzaz,"I’ve never read that, will have to check it out. Thanks!",t3_9qguxt
e8aw69r,t1_e89hzaz,Shit I almost forgot about that book! It really does remind me of The Giver!,t3_9qguxt
e8aba9u,t1_e89wxun,Haha that’s true! Yeah I’ve been considering making this into a novel/novella for ages but I always think there’s one more subject I need to read up on before doing so... might be time to jump right in,t3_9qguxt
e89cayj,t1_e89bbop,"Thank you! I was sad writing it, especially the ending ",t3_9qguxt
e89yoyx,t1_e89i7tb,Easier said than done. Those new lab-grown artificial meat burgers still require fetal cow serum during production. ,t3_9qguxt

e8abdpy,t1_e8a6jua,"Hahaha

Got to find the positives in any 9-5 job I guess",t3_9qguxt
e8dh3df,t1_e8a6jua,"Until the day you get older and suddently are gonna be 'disposed' like a lab rat because there are younger men who can provide better and healthy genes... Also no friends, family or any attachment because everything can be removed from you instantly.

I know sadly that some people's only utility in the world seems to be literally banging things, but I sincerely hope you meant that as a joke.",t3_9qguxt
