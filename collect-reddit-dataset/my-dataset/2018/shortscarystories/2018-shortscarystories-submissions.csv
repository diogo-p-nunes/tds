It's always the worst night of the year for us. Tonight is when the monsters come out. They've been with us for as long as we can remember now. 

They're always around, but it is New Years' Eve on which they get worse. Something seems to get into people. They're drawn to the monsters. We try to fight them, try to get the people to safety, tend to their injuries. Every year, hundreds of people get maimed, injured. Some even die. Not so many anymore, we've learnt how to deal with the evil that lurks in our world.

I watch the clock tick towards the inevitable start of the chaos, of the attacks. My tools are near me and I check them once again. Everything's there. Ready. Only a few minutes left now. I move to the canteen, to my brothers and sisters in arms. We're all ready for tonight's battle. While the minutes count down we wait, anxious for both the new year and the task that lays ahead of us.

The monsters are outside, waiting. Waiting to be released by the striking of the clock. Ten seconds. Five seconds. Three seconds.

""Happy New Year!"" We all shout together. But twenty minutes later, our first fight commences. I run back to my room and see it at once. A young boy, struck by one of the creatures. His hands are burned and one of his eyes is out. I doubt he'll see from it again. After I put on my gloves, I grab the first of my tools and we begin the operation to save his life. 

Goddamned fireworks, I think."
ab921i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ab921i/i_look_in_basement_windows/,I look in basement windows,121,6,1546276566.0," I’m a solitary person. My work only keeps me busy a few hours a day. But I just don’t fit in with city people or big city life. I have to find ways to entertain myself. I’m tired of browsing the internet and going to bars. I have too much time to kill. So I started making up games to entertain myself.

One of those was the basement window game. It’s pretty simple. The way buildings work here, you can see inside most people’s basements through small rectangular windows near the base of their homes. Some people put curtains on these windows, but most don’t. I always play the game at night. Every few nights, I’d pick a street, then look in every basement window and write down what I saw, like this:

*112 South St – Middle-aged man in underwear. Watching children’s cartoons, alone in the dark.*

*114 South St – Empty room with a sewing machine and expensive quilting table.*

*116 South St – Unfinished basement. rats have taken over.*

And so on, and so on. I know it’s a little creepy and a little voyeuristic. But it’s harmless and helps me pass the time. In the back of my head I thought that, maybe if I wrote enough, I could publish a book of them. Kind of a gritty “Humans of New York”.

Last Thursday, I played the basement window game. I started at 11:00 PM. The last thing I remember is leaving my house, then I woke up in my bed at 11:00 AM. I have no memory of what transpired in the interim. The only record I have of those twelve hours is the following notes I took during the game:

*1400 Ford Ln – Curtains drawn, can only see silhouettes. Party?*

*1402 Ford Ln – Rec room. Two women playing pool.* 

*1404 Ford Ln – The room is empty but I can’t stop looking at it. The walls are moving. Like TV static or maybe they’re covered in ants. There’s a man in the room but its empty. He looks just like the walls and he is GRAY. Hello gray man. He says come in. I’m too big but now I’m inside. Hello gray man. He shows me there are others. They are chained to the wall. They scream silently, with their eyes. Will I be chained? He says no. He says I’m not staying. He says I must send a message. He says that on Thursday, January 24th, Arthur Framptom will go GRAY. He says I must tell the world. He says I have been marked. He says if I don’t tell then I will be like the chained ones. He says I will have to stay in the GRAY house with him. When he touches me it burns.* 

I don’t know who Arthur Framptom is but I hope he reads this. I don’t know what I saw last Thursday and I don’t want to. I’m done playing the basement window game. Good luck Arthur, whoever you are.  "

DECEMBER 21st
 
Last day of school before holiday-break, thank Christ. 
Since the spoiled brats won’t pay attention to their studies today, I called a “show-and-tell.”
Tepid array of objects; geodes (yawn), trilobite or two. Vagueley interesting woolen shawl worn by a grandma when surviving the Titanic (dubious). And a weird little silver dagger, which I had to confiscate.
Beggars belief, really. Which idiot brings a weapon to class?! Shows how sheltered these rich-kids are. No common-sense.
At least the kid’s story was imaginative. On vacation in England, they’d made special arrangements to walk right up-close to Stonehenge. Normal folk aren’t allowed near. At dusk, the kid saw silver glinting on an ancient plinth. Claims he’s been cursed ever since. By an ""Invisible Wolfman"", I believe. Giggles from his classmates, but the kid stuck to his story, straight-faced. In fact, he looked pained. He always does, lately. Tired, too. 
He sobbed when I took his dagger; tears of… relief?!

DECEMBER 24th

Damn it. What was the kid’s story again? Something about how you can’t simply ditch the dagger; it finds its way back. It has to be willingly taken. 
I don’t believe in monsters. Ha ha. Hope I’m losing my mind.

DECEMBER 25th

Silent Night, Holy Night. I wish. That thing wouldn’t let me sleep a wink. The howling could've been written-off as a prank. Or stress-fuelled auditory hallucinations. 
But when the beast snorts and snarls, each night, I find condensation fading on my windows. And claw-marks on my door.
And I’m talking about my bedroom windows, on the second floor.
Today the claw-marks are on my bedroom door.

DECEMBER 26th

Gave the dagger to a nephew as a Christmas gift. Wrote a note explaining “saw this and thought of you, as you love historical artifacts.” Not anymore, though. He was torn to pieces in his sleep. My sobbing sister called his killer “A beast.”
Hit the bottle hard when I found the dagger back on my mantlepiece.
 
DECEMBER 27th

I’ve probably lost my job; don’t care about that anymore. Desperately tried to obtain a contact number or address for the kid. Eventually a secretary divulged that he’s an army brat, moves around a lot. Won’t return. Damn.

DECEMBER 30th

More booze tonight. I’m turning the dagger over-and-over in my trembling hands. Beautiful, really. And ancient. I imagine it thrust into Ceaser’s back. 
Spent today in the library. There’s no evidence that druids ever even sacrificed anyone; it’s Roman propaganda, like wicker-men. 
No hooded ghouls with silver daggers at midnight. Mine might be unique. 
Still clinging to the faint hope that I’m completely insane. It provides comfort when lying in bed, eyes clenched shut, whilst slobber and hot breath blast my face. 
It's sounding hungrier. I have one final idea.

NEWSPAPER CLIPPING, JANUARY 1st

A local schoolteacher, with no history of violence, was shot dead yesterday whilst brandishing a knife in a busy street... He was heard screaming to police ""TAKE IT! TAKE IT!"""
ab4s61,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ab4s61/fading/,Fading,5,0,1546239529.0,"I ended up in the hospital. The florescent lights reflecting on my face making me look paler than usual. The doctor came around the curtain and took one look at me, examined me quickly as if he already knew what happened. Stepping back he stated, “ you should be dead.” 
“Yeah, I guess it was a bad accident,” I said but not really knowing he was serious. 
“No, I mean, you shouldn’t be alive right now, you’re not, actually, but it’s weird because here you are.” Next thing I knew I was in a house. I didn’t fully understand what the doctor meant until the family I was staying with looked at me in horror when I walked  in the door. Their 6 year old daughter playing on the floor of the living room looked at me and giggled. “Your fading!” She looked and smiled as she said it, “But I still see you.” Her brown curls as beautiful as her giggle. Her mother walked in. Suddenly I didn’t feel well, not sick, just not myself. She told me she couldn’t see me anymore and I was fading fast but that she knew I would always be there. She reached out to hug me, the last hug she could ever feel. I reached out to her and embraced her. We each let out a single tear drop from the same eye, sighed, a she had to release me, rather I was almost gone and no long something of permanence she could hold. I knelt down and gave her daughter a ring that was an heirloom of sorts, she smiled and said “bye”. It was like she could still see me. That moment fear sunk in. I was afraid I was going to be alone forever aside from the occasional visits, afraid of what was to come. Then I remembered, Kyle! Where was he? Did he know I was coming? He passed away 2.5 years ago. He was my twin brother. Then in the slightest of instances it felt as if I was whisked away from everything. Then I was gone."

ab34oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ab34oo/just_once_more/,Just Once More,180,2,1546226400.0,"I promised her in November that I would go clean. I swore to her, on my mother's life. She knew how much I loved my mother, and she believed it. So did I.

Now it's December, and I realized this was a mistake. Murder isn't something that you can quit and go cold turkey, like drinking. It's not about the substance, the effect on your body. It's all about the rush. How it feels to choke the life out of a child. How the screams of a dying woman sound to your ears. How beautiful the blood flows out of stab wounds. It's about the senses, and the rush. And once it gets into your system, it's hard to get it out. No matter how hard you try, or how much others beg you not to. And God, did she beg.

My wife was my beacon of light these four years. She knew what I did, but loved me all the same. And every day I wanted to quit, I would think of *her*. I would see her face, framed by the golden curls that looked more beautiful than all of Solomon's treasury. I saw that smile, that would light up my world. And I saw those arms, that would hold me long into the night as I cried myself to sleep. She was always there. And everyday, she would ask me to stop. And everyday, I would try for *her.*

But now, the body I'm watching is not *her's*. The beautiful curve of her naked breasts, rising and falling with each breath. The brown hair that is pooled around her pillow. The figure, the beautiful figure with long legs. None of that belongs to *her*. This isn't *her*. And so, as I watch from the window, I forget *her* face, smile, and body. I forget *her* pleas and begging. The only one I can see is the girl through the window.

*I'm sorry, I have do it just once more. Next year, I'll do better. I swear. This is the last time.*

It's easy to pick the lock of the apartment, and a quick glance around the combined kitchen and den shows enough for me to confirm my suspicion. The girl looked barely seventeen, but I know she's a prostitute. No one would even miss her.

She was still sleeping by the time I entered her room, and the urge was so strong I could barely contain it. I fell on the bed, fell on her, feeling her bare body press tightly against my own. Her eyes flipped open in terror, but my hand was over her mouth before she could scream.

I remember whispering quiet reassurance as I slit her throat, and held her in my arms as she choked to death on her own blood. It was so dark, so beautiful. I watched the life drain from her eyes, and then the rush was gone. I was alone with another body.

*The last one. I swear.*"

ab04bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ab04bh/the_origin_of_nightmares/,The origin of nightmares,75,8,1546205915.0,"Do you know why bad dreams are called nightmares? 

&#x200B;

My Ex-Girlfriend once told me. It goes back to the German legend of the ""Nachtmahr"". Her German grandmother told her these stories, when she was younger. 

  
Nachtmahre are small, goblin-like creatures with sharp teeth and pointed ears. Their bodies covered in fur that is blacker than the night surrounding them. Their eyes lay so deep in their caves that there seem to be only holes and their devilish grin will send chills to the bones of everyone who ever saw it.

  
According to legends, they are summoned by Witches to do harm to people they deem to deserve it.  Nachtmare sneak into the house of their victim, crawl along the sealing like spiders and can even force themselves through even the smallest gaps and keyholes. 

  
If you are awake and a Nachtmahr is near, you might mistake the noises it makes for rats that scratch on your door.   
They approach their victim in their sleep and sit on their chest, putting pressure on the heart and lungs that can still be felt when the dreamer finally wakes up. 

  
But it aren't their razor sharp teeth or claws that are the most dangerous, it's their breath. When they sit on your chest, it's their chilling breath what gives you the bad dreams. Why do they do that? Because if you are under the spell of the Nachtmahr and wake up while it is sitting on your chest, it can grasp your soul, rip it out, squeeze through your throat and posses you body.   

The Nachtmahr then takes over their victims life. Close relatives might realize the change, but most likely will just dismiss it as stress. There is no way to reverse this process and the disembodied soul is then doomed to wait in the sphere between life and death, until another witch will summon them to become the next Nachtmahr. 

  
I always thought my Ex had a weird taste for twisted bedtime stories. But it wasn't just a story she told, it was a warning, to never break up with a witch. 

I didn't realize, until i broke up with her. "

Mama said she'd be back soon, just checking on the neighbours. If I hide maybe she will come tell the strangers to leave.

I hear them coming in now, without even knocking. 

Mama told me if they come I should run and hide. I'm in the living room so I run to the kitchen instead, that's farther away. I have a really good spot there.

I hear them put something down. It sounds heavy. I want to see what it is. I open the cupboard just a bit and look out.

These people are dressed weird. Mama says not to trust blue, but they have all different colours. I have never seen the things they carry. I don't understand.

They carry their toys into the living room.

One of them pulls at the front of his collar, he is cold I guess. I am so afraid, why are they here?

They are looking towards where I am hiding. I wish mama would come home. I remember ‘run and hide’. I should go farther.

I wait until they are looking the other way with their funny tools. I run for the stairs.

Oops! I hit a chair, and it made a sound! The strangers turn around and head towards it. I am glad it is dark so they don’t see me as I run. I try to be very quiet.

Now I am through the basement door and can watch them again. They are using those things and talking a lot. They seem excited now. I don't know what they want and why they are in here. I am trying not to cry.

I really want my mama.

They don't spend long there, now they move faster, heading towards me again.

I go down the stairs but the last step is squeaky. I always forget. I step on it by accident, and they follow.

Now they are so close I don't know where to hide. Our basement is small and the shelves are full. Nowhere to go.

So scared! Where’s mama?

They are right there, they shine their lights on me and move their weird boxes over my head.

I am so frightened! Mama?!

WHERE IS MAMA!

They jump like they got scared! They stumble to get away from me as fast as they can.

There must be something scary behind me! I turn.

Nothing is there, and when I turn back they are gone. I hear the door bang as they leave.

I am so glad they are gone!

Something shiny is on the ground. One of their things! I bend to see it.

It is weird material, not too heavy. It makes funny lights. On the back is a word I don't know,

P-A-R-A-N-O-R-M-A-L

And another word,

HUNT-ERS

I guess they are hunters. Maybe Papas friends?

There’s also a number! I know how to read numbers, mama helped me learn. It’s

2018

Want to know my favourite number? It's 1860, my birthday!

I hope mama comes home soon."

The story’s not fun,
Well, I guess it depends
On who’s reading it, though.

Picture yourself on a desert,
Miles from cities and towns.
Remember to be wide alert
As the story is beginning now.

All the airplane parts
Were far from each other
It was a big crash
Said commander Feelower.

The airline had told them
The plane wasn't full
To seek for survivors, 
Just one hundred and two.

So, they killed all the fire
And start counting the bodies
Some of the roasted, in parts or destroyed.

They went from the tail
To the head, cause you see
The tail was intact and,
The head was deadly.

It seemed in some way
For those in the back
Whatever had killed them
Was not for the crash.

They counted a few lawyers
A politician,
A couple of families,
And a mortician.

Some hand, some feet
And sadly one head,
Were found just laying
Some paces away.

They finished counting
And assembled the bodies,
One hundred and eight,
No survivors, sad story.

""One hundred and eight?
That doesn't make sense""
Said commander Feelower
Who felt the suspense.

""With the five from the flight crew
It doesn't add up,
One hundred and seven 
Must be what you got.""

So they counted again
And this time with Feelower,
It seems that this plane
Had one extra body.

They had to sleep there,
Somehow near the bodies
“we’ll take them away,
Just wait for the morning”

And through the night,
Something woke young Robert,
He walked out the tent
And he froze at the moment
He saw an old lady 
Dancing through the bodies
Naked and dancing
With, Oh, so much jolly.

The lady that saw him
Invited him to join
But Young Robert fainted,
Just hitting his groin.

The morning had come
And Feelower was happy
“I have an answer -he said-
To the problem”

""The one extra body
Was a lady who died
A few days ago
And he loved ones decide
To send her to bury
At her local town
Somewhere near Salem
Do you get it now?""

""I spoke to the airline
And they told me this
Hence the mortician
That was on the list.""

They pack all their gear,
And went back to the town
Young Robert decided that he didn't saw
The old lady dancing
With demons around.

Advice to the reader
When you travel in plane
There may be a body,
Keep that in your head.

He had a lovely wife, Queen Ratna, who was well verse in several arts. She was with a child and the public expected the child to live up to the prestige and nobility that it would be born into. 

One night, a cruel emperor from the neighbouring kingdom, Guru, invaded the castle with his army. His soldiers wreaked havoc in the village bear the castle and burnt down homes. The castle was surrounded by the enemy on all sides. The unprepared night guards were easily over powered.  The good king and his guards ensured that the heavily pregnant Ratna escaped through the emergency tunnel. 

Ratna managed to take herself to a village that was unaffected and the kind strangers took her in, as a sign of allegiance to her. The next day, the slain king was paraded on a spear for all the subjects to see. The hapless queen fainted when she saw it and subsequently miscarried. 

Instead of being broken, she swore revenge. She learnt the ways of the common man and blended very well with the public. Meanwhile, Guru turned the conquered kingdom into his new capital and had a male child. The newly transformed Ratna, along with the aid of her well wishers, soon became the prince’s nanny. 

Ratna cared for the Prince like her own lost child. Probably she made for it through him. She taught him manners, how to carry oneself, to be kind and fair and the matters of the State – everything that a Prince should know. But over the years, she even poisoned his ears against Guru. So much so, that by the time he turned 16, he was seething with hatred towards his own father. She even had him convinced that he was the slain king’s son and she was his birth mother. 

And so one night, fate came to a complete circle when the young Prince snuck into Guru’s chamber in the night, just like his father had so many years ago. Ratna ran into the courtyard outside of the king’s chamber. The sound of swords clashing cut through the air. As guards started running towards the chamber, Ratna’s eyes welled up. 

She didn’t know which was a better outcome – Guru being killed by his own son or having to live with the guilt of killing his heir.

Tonight, I finally spoke to the darkness that has followed me for as long as I can remember. The darkness that shrouded my eyes in the theatre and surrounded my leg in the ambulance. 

The darkness that has kept me away from anything that might hurt me. 

I asked the darkness, “Why?”

Why me?

Why is it protecting me?

Why is it slowly ruining my life?

Tonight, the darkness replied. I’d never met my mother, she had passed in childbirth. 

But tonight, my mother spoke to me through the darkness. 

And as I saw the dark become light, for the first time in my life..

The night before, Will got what he needed. The large trash bag contained Will's future. He just hoped it wouldn't make much noise. The day of the interview came. His parents asked him why he was wearing a crappy white t-shirt, but Will didnt answer. Will got to the building where his interview would take place. Men in sunglasses guided him and his slightly moving trash bag to the interview room.

After 10 minutes, he walked in. Him and his interviewer shook hands. The interviewer introduced himself as Jim. Jim's eyes turned to the trash bag. Will shot him a smile and opened the bag. In the bag was Travis's cut up body. The body was still slightly twitching. Jim investigated the body. He shot Will a good look and told him to wait outside. After another 5 minutes he called Will back in. 

""Ok Will. Show me an effective throat slit."" Said Jim.

Will smiled and slit the throat of the man tied to the chair. 

""I think you're hired Will."" Said Jim.

As Will looked at the dying man bound to a chair in front of him, he couldnt help but smile.

Try not to struggle against it, the sleepiness, I mean. It's normal, we won't let anything happen, you know? You're safe here.

More noises, fainter, further away? Quieter. Moon is quieter too, sleepier. Deep breaths, a warm feeling crawling through the veins. I don't understand. I was already asleep, why do I have to go back? Eyelids straining under their own weight, but I want to stay here, awake. My arms are deadened. 

Shhhh now. Warm hands push my head, gentle but forceful. A figure across the room, more shadow than man, but garbed in white perhaps, dark marks adorning the gown.

Her fingers seem to curl around themselves as they nearly reach her feet, and her head brushes against the ceiling.

The way her eyes look at me, they see my soul- my hopes and my lies.

She stands and watches me for eternity until she moves closer. Only one step is all it takes for her to reach my bedside. Then I see her legs, so full of veins and blood you’d be forgiven to think that there was no skin above them.

Her fingers drill into my eyes as I begin to fall. I fall through my mind, down my throat, into my heart and then into my bed awake.

I conclude that night's story. Around me, sitting around the bonfire casting their dark faces cast in a red glow, the Papuas sit and stand, listening to me. As far as I can tell, they were entirely captivated by the gospel as I once again told them of how Christ had died on the cross for us all.

It has been about two years, I believe, since I came to the island of New Guinea on behalf of the Church. I remember the plane landing in Hollandia. The Dutch authorities had consented, considering any form of Christianity to be preferable to whatever heathenry the Papuas practiced. 

Already, I've managed to convert three other tribes in the mountains and this will be the fourth. I'm not sure why my words resonate with them so much. Perhaps it is in the stories, or perhaps just in the way I tell them. 

I can't help but grin as I see the faces of the villagers. Some of the women hold babies that I have baptized. We're well on our way here, I say to myself, proud. 

After the story, I lead them in a hymn, singing loudly. The Papuas sing along happily, though I suspect the words they sing aren't quite to our Lord. That's alright. After that, communion. I feel even more joy as I see that almost all of the village joins in as I pass around the hosts (though they are actually just crackers from a food parcel I got from some of my brothers at the mission) and dispense the wine (really just water with berries to color it red). It's the thought that counts. 

I give them the body and the blood of Christ. In some way I feel like this is like the Last Supper. The way we sit there together. I almost hate for it to end and I feel alone as I go back to my hut.

In bed, I check my diary. I make a habit of it to write something every day, to keep the date. Tomorrow is Good Friday.

Sleep comes easy that night as I lay in the tropical night air. Rays of sunlight graze my face, waking me up. I get up and get dressed. I comb my hair and get outside. I feel the smile break out on my face as I look up the hill and see the cross they've erected. How beautiful! Wonderful! I'm getting close. Soon this village will be saved too. 

Some of them come my way, smiling brightly. One of them points at the cross on the hilltop. While the others start to gently guide me towards it, he grins ""The highest honor. For you."" he says as he holds up a pair of nails and a hammer in front of me."

He emerged from the crystalline forest into a wide meadow. Each flower in the tall grass was mathematically perfect. Fibonacci leaf spirals, fractal petals in millions of dynamic colors. Each one was an opal on a slender green stalk. 


Jim II collapsed and slicked the sweat from his face. He focused his dizzy vision on a single opal-flower, bouncing gently in the evening wind. 


“Stay right here,” he told the flower. “Just stay right here with me for a while. Don’t change.”


The flower refused to comply, trading hues like mad as the light hit it from slightly different angles during each bounce. 


Jim II sighed. 


“You, too, huh?” he said. “They’ll be along soon. The Etchers. And then you’ll be gone.”


The flower continued its slow bobbing.


“That isn’t right,” Jim II said. “You won’t be gone. I will. You’ll still be here. But I won’t even have a memory of you, even if you have a memory of me. It’ll be like this whole moment never happened.”


A flock of mechanical birds burst above the treeline behind Jim II. Maybe three, four hundred yards away. Their identical tweets were almost lost in the soft puft-puft-puft of their carbon fiber wings. 


“Won’t be long now,” Jim II said. “See the birds? That’s the Etchers. They’re going to be here in a little while. They’ll drag me back and install a new image print on me at the Glade. Unless I run. Unless I keep running.

The flower’s bounce altered slightly, the stem swinging toward Jim II as if in interest. 


“And then I’ll be Jim. Again, I suppose. Jim II won’t exist anymore.” 


The flower swung back. Jim II had lost its interest.


“And you’ll stay right here. Will you remember me?”


Jim II took the continued bobbing as a nod. 


“Thank you,” he said, closing his eyes and stretching out in the grass. “I can’t run anymore. I just can’t.”


He kept his eyes closed, listening for footsteps. All he heard were the mechanical birds in the distance.

Anything can be scary, given the right context.

A children’s stuffed elephant? Not scary at all. But if you were to see that same elephant sitting alone in a dark room, where you would swear there had been no elephant before? That’s terrifying. A couple of cold beers? Sounds thirst-quenching, not horrifying. But being forced to drink those beers before you walk across a thin plank, suspended over a pit of snakes? Scary as shit.

This principle applies to anything from friendly old people to dollar store candles. Context matters. With the right context, even a friendly introduction can be chill you to your core.

“Steve, this is Mary Beth Perkins!”

“Good to meet you Steven! Your wife tells me you’re a surgeon?”

That seemingly innocuous introduction drained the color from my face and caused sweat to accrue on my brow. It was not the first time I had been acquainted with Mary Beth Perkins. She was my first real patient. The first piece of meat I cut into. She had a Gastric tumor. I was supposed to save her. I was supposed to cut it out.

Instead, I accidentally nicked her stomach lining. Stomach acid poured into her body. It sizzled and burned at her organs. It smelled like cooking bacon. If she hadn’t been so heavily anesthetized, she would have been in agony. She couldn’t scream. She never knew what I did.

She died quietly on the operating table from “unforeseen complications”.

That was a year ago.

Today I saw her smile and listened to her drone on about her life. A life I once ended. A life that should not still be occurring. After a while, I watched her get in her car and drive away. All I could think is that, for such a friendly, interesting woman – she was the most terrifying creature I ever met.

Even a scar can be scary, given the right context. While my Wife was in the bathroom, Mary Beth Perkins showed me a scar on her right side.

“Cancer of the stomach. Surgeons cut out a tumor. Almost killed me, but I made it! Now, I’m stronger than ever.”

She said that last part with a wink.

My wife says we should get together with Mary Beth again soon. I tell her we shouldn’t. Because Mary Beth sent me a letter today. Normally, a letter isn’t scary at all. But this one is. It only says eight words. But those words make me shiver. Anything can be scary, if you know the context. 

“I know. And you'll get what you deserve.”"

Greetings everyone!

I hope everyone enjoyed their holidays! I know I did. Days off from work. Time well spent with the family. Lots of good food. Good times!

If ya'll remember nearly three years ago, February 2016, a few moderators and I posted [an announcement](https://redd.it/478ppc) about putting a charity project together for /r/ShortScaryStories. In December of 2016, we released Horror d'Oeuvres - Bite-Sized Tales of Terror into the world and raised $1060+ dollars (and counting) which have been donated to a horror based charity called [Scares That Care](https://scaresthatcare.org/). It is a 100% volunteer IRS approved 501(c)(3) charity focused on fighting the REAL MONSTERS of childhood illness, burns and breast cancer by helping families that are experiencing these extraordinary hardships cope with the financial burden. You can see proof of those donations being made over the past couple of years by [following this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Human_Gravy/comments/5gy144/scares_that_cares_donation_informationhorror/).

After releasing Bite-Sized Tales of Terror, I took a much-needed break from the editing process. During this time, I got many messages asking about when we were going to do a follow-up anthology. Earlier this year in January, I decided it was time to take up the mantle once more and began the process of gathering a bunch of authors, workshopping their stories with them, and getting them into shape for publication. 

Today, I am proud to announce the release of the 2nd Volume of Horror d'Oeuvres trilogy: [It Came From the Snack Bar!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNLV23W).

In celebration of our latest release and to commemorate the second anniversary of Volume 1, [Bite-Sized Tales of Terror](https://www.amazon.com/Horror-dOeuvres-Bite-Sized-Tales-Terror-ebook/dp/B01N0QI1HN/ref=tmm_kin_title_sr?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) is available to download for the epic price of **FREE** for a limited time! Please enjoy our freshmen effort at your own peril! If you enjoy it, please think about buying **It Came From the Snack Bar!**

Once again, all revenue generated from the sale of BOTH anthologies (and the 3rd one when it comes out next year) will be donated to the Scares That Care Charity. Literally, no one is making money off this at all. Even the book covers were donated by our friends over at [Maeltopia](https://www.maeltopia.com/)

If you aren't a fan of ebooks, I'm currently working on getting the paperback version made available on Amazon. Still working on the formatting so it won't be up until it is finished probably next year. 
_______________________

**But Gravy, you are pretty much a stranger to me, how can anyone trust you handling money? How do I know you aren't blowing this on strippers and booze?**

Well, that's an entirely valid concern. I'd love to address it.

These projects were born from a bad experience myself and several authors from /r/NoSleep and /r/ShortScaryStories had a bunch of years ago with a very similar situation. We donated our stories to a charity book project organized by a creepypasta author who still remains extremely popular online to this day. Once this anthology was completed, we were never given any updates, proof of donation, or any sales numbers. When asked about these topics, the author/organizer wouldn't give us any information about it. After repeated questioning yielding nothing but resistance to answering basic questions and being told we shouldn't expect any answers, we realized we'd been screwed and so had the charity. 

At the end of the day, no one knows if the money was ever donated or not. I tread carefully on accusing or naming this person because there is no evidence indicating this person *did not* donate the money. There is also no evidence this person *did*. In the end, this shady behavior left a bad taste in my mouth and to this day, we still don't know anything about it except the book is now unavailable to buy. The point of rehashing this old history is pretty much to say I know how it feels being on the shit end of the stick and it's not something I would ever want to do to anyone else. 

Because of this, I made it a point to be as transparent as possible. Over on /r/Human_Gravy, there is a Green Post for Horror d'Oeuvres dedicated explicitly to housing all updates on financial transactions. This link is in the books too. Anyone can see this page. There will be screenshots of the Amazon royalty statements, proof of the donations being made, and receipts. I'm open to suggestion on other ways to prove I'm not taking this money and blowing it on myself. 

And honestly, my honor, integrity, and my good name are worth more to me than financial gain. This money belongs to people in need and it is sickening to think of taking it from them.

We have explored forward, and backward, every mountain, every valley. We already lived here for a very long time, after all, and we have passed down our knowledge for generations.

Until one time, when we heard thunderous pulsating noise on the sky. The first noise surprised everyone, as it was very likely can be heard from thousand miles away. And then another. And another. We send some army personnels to fly to the source of the bang, and behold the sky was getting cracked open with loud noises! Every bang send shockwave that shook our devices and tools, rendered them unusable by the time we arrived near the source. 

Not long after, the sky truly cracked with a final boom, and a very bright light came in. It was so bright that it caused our army personnels to instantly went blind. We decided to call that entity as “God”, as we are unworthy to see Him even to just bask in His light. So, to avoid any more casualties from the light of God, we decided to retreat to the hidden part of the world, far from the light. Who knows what destruction His wrath could bring upon us?

Farming has always been one of the pillars of our society. Well, as far back as we can tell. 

Humans actually started the foray into agriculture about 8,500 BC, from what any of us can guess. 

Grains grown in the Fertile Crescent and an end to a purely nomadic lifestyle.

 In roughly 7,000 BC, livestock began to be tamed and kept as well. That’s a long time spent honing in what is sometimes an underappreciated craft.

&#x200B;

I am of the mind that farming is something you are born into. I grew up on this farm, learning early on what my duties were and would be.

 Yet, every day on the farm is different, and any farmer worth their salt will tell you that you just have to roll with the punches. You get behind on one chore, and others pile up quickly.

This is what I thought to myself as I walked briskly to barn 49. I had been behind on harvest for three or four days straight now, and I was sure it wouldn’t be pretty.

&#x200B;

I opened the door to the truly massive structure housing about 300 cages, almost all of which were currently full, and ready for harvest. I sighed as I collected my tools, this was going to be a long day.

 Some cages rattled as they noted my presence, and exhausted baleful eyes tracked me from all sides.

 I preferred not to look at their eyes, just one of things that helps, I never give them names either.

At cage 1 I prepared my extractor and bucket, glancing at its inhabitant. Filthy skin and hair matted with dirt, sweat, and feces. I grabbed this ones chin to take a look in the mouth. 

Due to my tardiness with the harvest, a full set of teeth hid, some hanging into the mouth attached only by a bloody thread, under another full set, this one struggling to find room in the hideous, time mangled orifice. They protruded at odd angles, some cutting through the skin of its face and lips causing horrible open flesh wounds and scabs ripe with puss, caked gruel, and blood. It was worse than I thought.

Holding the human’s chin firmly I began to remove the teeth one by one, careful not to damage them but with little regard for the mouth they came from. 

This one whimpered and groaned, tears cut thin lines through the dirt and gore, but I barely noticed as I completed the harvest. The bloody teeth hit the bottom of the pail each with a small, metallic, thud.

We had been farming humans for their teeth since we discovered their useful properties in the year 2234. They were a delicacy in my colony, and my farm was extremely profitable. We had figured out a serum to genetically mutate the mouth to continually renew the resources; they never stopped growing, set after set. I really do enjoy being a farmer, but best to never look them in the eyes."

I have occupied myself for almost as long as I can. I think. My mind has exhausted the usual topics which prevent me from succumbing to boredom. Quite some time must have passed, then. Surely, someone will hear me.

I remember just the other day, I went to go visit my brother. There was a new moon that night, very dark, indeed. Much like my present situation. He left me on the porch for quite some time, but when I stepped inside, he told me all about how he had to go to the bathroom. There was no toilet paper. So he did that sort of waddle, you know? He waddled over to the closet and heard my knocking. Clearly, he couldn't come to the door like that. Suppose it had been a kid; come to borrow a cup of sugar for their mom?

I had to pee, so I tugged on my father's sleave to let him know. He looked at me, then up, then back at me and pointed to the door of the restroom, a few tables back toward the rear of the cafe. I hurried off to go.

At the top there was a hallway, and I figured after a few moments that the room I had heard the sound from must be on the right to be above me so I walked over and knocked quietly on the door.

A sweet voice said, ""Come in"", it was pleasantly upbeat and earnest, and I felt no hesitance in stepping through the doorway. I was at once in a bedroom, cozy but with many containers and boxes, the contents of which I could not make out. By a dressing table stood an elderly woman, she had a kind face, and held something in her hand as she addressed me. 

""You are lost, and you must be very careful young one, there is much to fear in the world."" she smiled gently, and held the small object out to me. ""Keep this with you always, it will keep you safe from the dark ones.""

I took the object and noticed it was a small piece of ornamental soap. It's light fragrance was strange but not unpleasant. I put it in my pocket, and without another word, returned to my parents, who hadn't even noticed my absence. We enjoyed the rest of our vacation immensely. 

Just yesterday, on my 28th birthday, I told my parents this particular story for the first time, over a glass of wine and a few trips down memory lane.

They grew immediately pensive and serious, and told me that the people they had been talking to in the cafe had shared a story. They said ""the cafe is the first level of an old apartment building. In the upstairs apartment a German woman suffocated her 8 children and kept the bodies by making them into soaps and storing them in the bedroom. Her victims were not discovered until her death, at a very old age.""

I wish I hadn't kept the soap. "

Passing the disused railway tunnel on his way back from the town centre always creeped him out. He quickened his pace past it, pulling his coat tighter around his body.

Until he heard his mother, calling from its depths.

“Michael! Come here!”

He froze.

“M-mum?” he called back, his voice weaker than usual.

“I need help! I’m trapped. Help me, Michael!”

Spooked, he ran the rest of the way home, where he found his real mother cheerfully cooking dinner. She told him he looked as if he’d seen a ghost. Unsure how to bring the subject up, he tried to act like nothing happened. 

The days ticked by and he tried to forget about whatever it was that tried to imitate his mother. From that day on, though, his mother’s voice always gave him a slight chill, like it wasn’t entirely hers anymore.

Ten years later she died of cancer. Walking through his hometown after the funeral, he found himself at the mouth of the railway tunnel. Deep inside, he heard a cackle. It was his mother’s laugh but without any of her warmth."
aa2zk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/aa2zk7/freddys_present_day/,Freddy's Present Day,63,2,1545943245.0,"The very best thing about the holiday season is that old friends come home to visit their buddies. I only ever had one friend, his name is Will and I've always kinda looked up to him.


Will was the coolest guy at our high-school, smart and funny (a real prank-master) and popular; every damn thing that I wasn't. He took me under his wing, and made my days bearable; Showed me how to “fit in”, taught me how to talk to girls. He set me up with my only relationship, though Marcy is long-gone now.


And every year Will meets me in a bar. It was a decade ago that he first told me about his little experiment. 


Turns out he'd been landed with a kid. These things happen, right? But Will was determined to make the best of the situation. Determined to have a little fun.


He had a genius theory. He believed that children learn to love goody-two-shoes, make-believe characters because society sorta FORCES them to. Pikachu, Kermit, Ben-10. The “good” guys. But what if a kid was conditioned from birth to love Leatherface, and Charles Manson? They'd cease to be the stuff of nightmares, and become cherished, loved; emulated in playground games.


Will named his son “Satan”, and always kept me up-to-speed each Christmas. Satan's bedroom was painted black, the bars on his crib spattered with fake blood. His toys were shrunken-heads, voodoo-dolls and ouija boards. Will read bedtime stories about Jeffrey Dahmer and Jason Vorhees, and warned about “Peppa the twisted pig”, and “Barney the Boogyman dinosaur”. I sat listening in awe as I heard how happy the “Halloween” movies made Satan, and how he recoiled in horror at SpongeBob and Squidward.


But as Satan grew older, problems popped up. He felt overlooked every Christmas day, but since Santa Claus was practically the antichrist, Will improvised by inventing “Freddy's present day”, when Freddy Krueger would visit well-behaved kids, delivering gifts gleaned from their favorite nightmares. 


I had to hand it to Will; he had the courage of his convictions, and always assured me that Satan was a well-adjusted kid who just happened to be “creepy as f**k”. And if his deadbeat mom over showed up, boy she'd get a nice surprise, laughed Will.


But this Christmas, Will wasn't his usual jovial self. He'd bumped into my mom and learned that I'd had a kid with Marcy, ten years ago. Will asked angrily why I'd never told him; I shrugged and explained that I never talked about myself much. I asked about Satan, but Will said he'd invented the whole story, as I was “so f**king gullible”. He downed his drink and left, muttering “Freddy’s present day. Can you imagine anything more messed-up?” 


A little shaken, I headed home and checked on Baphomet, snoring softly inside his coffin; presumably thanking Freddy for the presents beneath our razor-wire tree adorned with upside-down crucifixes. Baphomet smiled, clutching his carving-knife, and I felt reassured. I'm a great dad."

Or at least it feels like it; it’s tough to say when you’re in the middle of nowhere.  And your clock’s been blinking 12:00 for as long as you can remember.
 
Can’t say exactly why I set off on this road trip.  Maybe it was just the call of adventure.  Wandering the open highways, the road less travelled and all that.  Yeah, that worked out *real* well.  I’m hot, I’m itchy, and I’m running out of trail mix.  Not that I’d eat much more of it anyway.  A guy can only take so many nuts and berries before he cracks, you know?
 
I’m beginning to think I don’t need help in that department.  You know how when it’s super hot out the road looks like it’s all wavy?  My eyes are starting to do that on their own.  And I swear that when I last checked the GPS there was an exit coming up.  Not there now though.
 
If only I hadn’t lost the radio signal, at least I’d have something to keep me entertained.  It’s just static.  And some AM talk station that’s not even in English.  Sounds like German or something.  Totally useless.
 
Okay, it’s not just me.  The GPS *definitely* showed a bend in the road a second ago.  But now it’s gone.  The highway’s straight as a rod.  The signal must have gone the way of the radio; this thing’s not triangulating a darn thing.  I knew I should have bought that map at the gas station back in… what town was that?  How long ago was that?  Ah, doesn’t matter.  There’s got to be something coming up before too long.
 
It’s funny, I must be moving just fast enough with the curve of the earth.  The sun has stayed above me this whole time.  Except… Aren’t I moving…
 
Wait.  Is that a town up ahead?  I’m not starting to see mirages, am I?  Pretty sure that’s a sign you’re a goner.
 
No!  That’s definitely a real life, God honest town.  Thank you hallelujah!  We’re back on track.  I’ll just stop for a bit, talk to the locals, and get my bearings.  I hope they have a good diner; I’m starving all of a sudden.
 
Huh, it’s not on the- of course it’s not on the GPS.  Piece of crap.
 
Look, they’ve even got one of those welcome signs on the town line.  Don’t see those much anymore.  But that’s what I love about these trips, you always find some new place hidden in the heart of America.

I had no idea there was a town out here called Bermuda..."

I grabbed a bottle of wine and went to the living room to curl up with a good book.  I had only read a couple of chapters when I heard a noise outside my apartment door, I listened for a moment then it stopped.  I shrugged and continued reading, once again the noise started outside my door. 

I sat there a moment listening, it seemed to be getting louder.  I decided to get up and look through the peephole. I could not see anything and the noise was getting louder.  I put chain lock in place and opened the door, I could see shadows near the stairway entrance.  

One shadow was large and abnormal looking, the other was like something laying on the floor.  I grabbed my cell from the entry table and unlocked the door.  I quietly made my way down the hall, my heart pounding.  The spine-chilling noises getting louder.  I told myself I needed to turn back but my curiosity was stronger. 

I turned on phone video and inched my way to the corner.  I peeped quickly around and was terrified at what I saw.  Before me was a half man, half wolflike demonic-looking creature.  It was feasting upon a woman, ripping her apart piece by piece.  

My phone rang alerting the monster to my presence.  It turned and faced me.  Its red eyes boring into mine, I knew this was the end, this hideous creature was going to kill me. I could feel myself losing consciousness and falling to the floor, the beast was coming towards me then blackness.  

I woke up screaming, I looked around to see if the beast was still there, oddly I found I was in my living room, on the couch.  How could this be?  Was it all a dream?  

There was a knock on the door, I hesitantly looked through the peephole, it was John from across the hall. I opened the door,  he said he heard screaming and was worried.  I asked him to come in because I didn't want to be alone.  

I poured us a drink and told him about my nightmare.  He put his arms around me for comfort and assured me it was just a nightmare.  

I excused my self to go to the restroom.  My phone rang,  reminding me of my nightmare, I checked videos,  I had recorded everything.  I watched not believing my eyes, as the creature changed.  It was John!  John was that hideous monster and he was on my couch.  What was I going to do?  

I washed my hands, splashed water on my face and opened the door, John was standing there, he said ""I wish you hadn't seen that"" and changed before my eyes. I was trapped.  His taloned hand reached for my throat. I screamed as he growled.  Talons pierced my throat, fangs sank into my cheek. My last thought, please let this be just a nightmare."

Or why some people just seem to have a harder time in life than others?  That’s because of me.  You see, I have a gift.  A gift that allows me to manipulate what people see and the experiences they have.  I’m not the only one though.  There’s actually quite a few of us, and we’re everywhere.  We control everything.  Every thought.  Every action.  Every feeling.  We control pain.  Sickness.  We control who lives and who dies, and what kind of life or death they have.  We control it all.  There are rules though.  Rules that must be followed, with dire consequences if broken.  One rule that I’m breaking right now is speaking of our existence.  You see, we are not born with this gift.  It’s passed to us.  Passed to us by another that possesses the gift.  And by simply speaking of my gift, I have now passed it to you.  You may be thinking that this is great news and dreaming of ways to use your newfound power.  But I must warn you, this truly is no gift at all.  We see the world for what it really is.  We see the awful things that no one else sees unless we want them to see it.  We feel the terrible pain that no one else feels unless we want them to feel it.  The only way to stop it is to pass the gift on, which I have now done to you.  Once the gift has been passed, we are at the mercy of those that possess it.

Now it’s an apology.

I can’t remember my name anymore, or the faces of the people I might have loved, or who might’ve loved me. All I remember is the change.

Just woke up one day in a room. Probably my room, but I don’t remember where it is, or what it looks like, what kind of posters might be on the walls, if I am messy or neat. I woke up hungry. I walked through an apartment, or a house, to the kitchen. I might have passed family, or a girlfriend, or a wife, or my children. I don’t know how old I am, so I don’t know if it’s possible that I had a family of my own. I just remember the hunger, how bottomless it was, is, how nothing seemed to touch the collapsed walls of my empty stomach.

Once the food was gone I left. Maybe this town, maybe another. Even before the change they all kind of looked the same, right? I feel like that’s right, although I can’t remember. Spent however much money I had left at a restaurant. Did I impress anyone paying attention with how much I ate? Did I disgust them? No matter how much, though, I was still hungry. Am still hungry.

I don’t remember when I felt full, finally sated. Nor do I remember who is was that sated me. Was it a man or a woman? A child? What color were their eyes?

I’m fading more and more. I have been reduced to a single biological impulse, the lizard-brain need to feed. 

This was supposed to be a warning, tacked up on this pole near the woods behind you. I had hoped that I would just disappear into the trees and die, but the hunger won’t let me die. It grows, alive, demanding to be worshipped, and I can do nothing but supplicate and worship.

I tried, I did, I promise. For what it’s worth.

All I can say now is I’m sorry.”

I'm sure some of you are thinking what could possibly be wrong with people singing songs, and to that I say quite a lot.

Because most are truly just festive but there are some who are robbers some who would kill you, and there's a certain family like that where I'm from.

They really are quite harmless as long as you listen, they even give you gifts, but if you turn away from them or ask them to leave you'll quickly realize the knives they have are a bit to sharp to just be for frosting gingerbread houses.

I've seen them for myself, I know they are real but they might also be pushing past the limits I'm sure my friend was lying but if he wasn't they were at my door and his at the same time.

My roommate's bed had wrapped itself around him, seemingly crushing him, and contorting his body in such a way that he was no longer in one piece. 

The bed began to move again, twisting and crushing itself further, making that god awful noise once more. 

I head a creak in the floor boards behind me, It was my roommate's girlfriend. 

""huh"", she said, ""I guess that book isn't bullshit after all"". "

He crawled through it and woke the sleeping farmer in the front room-chair.  ""Who are you mister?"" the frightened farmer asked the thief.  ""I am your nightmare sir"" the robber responded and was about to shoot him, but the farmer gripped the robber's shotgun and it went off, up, into the ceiling.  The burglar pulled the trigger and discovered the shotgun was empty.  

The farmer pulled the weapon from him and the thief saw a huge rock out the window.  Grabbing it, he struck the farmer in his head with it, knocking him out.  The rock split in two and a pink slime spilled from within it, onto the robber's shirt.  ""What the heck?!"" he hollered.  He dropped the split rock and saw the goo grow.  A few minutes went by and the robber exited the front door with a sack.  As he drove a truck from the farm, the pink-colored slime covered his clothes.  Then it turned into a pink sort of fungus.  

""What the heck is going on?!??"" the thief shouted in horror.  He pulled his truck over, got out of it and tried to cut off the fungus from his shirt very carefully with a pocket-knife.  The fungus just kept on growing.  ""Ah, come on, what crap is this fungus?!"" he bellowed into the night.  Later on, the farmer came to and meandered outside.  ""HOLY MOLY!"" he screamed, seeing a fungus-thing on twos.  Its head was like a pink flower with red around its  hole-like mouth.  Red claws were on its toes and fingers, as the thin monster leapt from the country-road to the farm.  The monster growled deeply at the farmer, and he got the robber's shotgun, loading it in a hurry.  

The thing got to the doorway of the farmhouse, clawing at the farmer's face, growling away.  He screamed, shooting it right in the face.  The monster fell dead on the porch.  The farmer chugged a bottle of Bourbon on the porch and saw the face of the burglar's corpse then, in the fungus where he had blown-away the flower from.  "

a9uv69,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a9uv69/its_a_trap/,It's a trap,60,3,1545876647.0,"  I never gave much thought to what I wanted to be when I grew up. As the daughter of a pediatric surgeon and a psychologist everyone just assumed I would follow somewhere in the medical field.

  The problem was that both of my parents talked about knowing what their life would look like from a very early age. They knew they wanted to help people, steer lives whatever way they could. It's not that I don't think that sounds noble, but the thought always kind of stressed me out. Being responsible for another human's life, or secrets, that's a lot.

 My parents even kept tabs on many of their past patients, so often our home was a revolving door of familiar and unfamiliar faces. They always said they wanted to see how they had grown, and changed. It was always both awkward and annoying sitting there forcing a barely passable smile as the strangers yammered on. My parents listened so intently, but I was just bored. 

  Nevertheless as I prepared for my medical internship I began noticing faint flutterings of excitement. Maybe due in large part to living up to familial expectations, but either way I did start to get into it. The more I was exposed to the patients, the surgeries, the more I became entranced, and I poured myself into my work over the following years. I became a very good general surgeon, maybe even great, and after passing my boards I had no shortage of offers from practices and hospitals across the country.

 My parents were beyond thrilled. Even though they may have faked it pretty well, I was sure they had some doubt I would ever get there. They asked to sit down together one night to talk options, and as it turned out, to add another. They wanted me to work with them on a deeply confidential clinical trial. 

 When I agreed it was with happy tears wetting my eyes, and they proceeded to further explain their plans. My delight quickly faded and I felt myself begin to break out in a cold sweat. The tears of joy turned to a single tear of horror attempting escape down my pale cheek. I was hearing their words as though in a dream. No, not a dream, a nightmare.

They were using the children my mother operated on to test the implantation of neurological altering tools, or NATs, for the government. For years afterward they would monitor them, sending signals to cause mood disorders, irrational fears or actions and my father would track them through therapy. They could do damage, but so far not good. I was the first NAT recipient with a ""good"" outcome. Otherwise, they said, I would never have become what they wanted. They say we could make anyone into anything. Change the world. 

  I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I guess it never mattered. "

I step in and to be safe I lock the door, it's actually pretty dark, so I reach for the lights and turn them on. I head upstairs to the bedroom and there she is, the sleeping beauty. I smile as I lean over and kiss her forehead, afterwards I head into the bathroom. I grab the toothbrush and brush my teeth and use the cup to gurgle. I feel kind of thirsty now, I look at the bed and head down stairs. I open the fridge and grab some of my favorite juice. Just then I hear some footsteps behind me, there it was the gleaming knife coming at me. At that moment I move out of the knife's path and take it from the attacker's hands pinning the attacker down and impaling the knife in their neck. As I take the knife out, blood sprays all over me and as this happens my eyes open wide. I fall back on my butt. Was it relief or nerves? I don't know, but I start laughing quietly, I stand up and go to the front door. As I try to open it, I notice that it was locked as I left it. I unlock the front door and step outside, just to be safe I lock the door. Already outside I stumble over and get in my car.

""I made them yellow, so they work for a boy or a girl!"" she gushed, already shoving the next gift into my lap, this one adorned with cartwheeling Santa Clauses. I placed the booties beside me, on top of the growing pile of baby dross. So far none of the gifts addressed to me had actually been for me, which only tightened the screws on my anxiety. I didn't know how to tell them about the bathtub, the slow fireworks blooming between my thighs until the lukewarm water was thick with them. Of the silence within me ever since.

""Thanks, Mom. You really...that was really thoughtful of you.""

""The next one's from your brother. He wanted to be here today, but you know...Delta"" Dad said, tipping his glass of scotch at such an extreme angle the ice cubes slid into his nose. ""He'll be here New Year's, if American Airlines is any more competent than those chucklefucks - ""

""Harold!"" Mom cut his sentence off at the quick. ""Sorry, Margie. Just you know how I feel 'bout family being together for the holidays. 'Specially considering."" Dad gestured vaguely in my direction, the half-melted ice in his glass clinking against the side. Mom was already on her feet to retrieve it for his refill. She chucked him lightly on the shoulder as she passed. ""Behave.""

""Well you best go on and open it, kiddo. Brandon'll want to know what you think of it on the Skype call later."" Not really much choice but to oblige them. My fingers worked the tape on the edges of the package before abandoning delicacy and tearing the paper away.

""What is it, Mom?""

""It's a breast milk warmer, honey. Microwaving destroys the nutrients. Better for the little one.""

Again I saw the soundless fireworks, the red ring around the tub after I pulled the stopper. Since that rush of blood shortly after my eleventh birthday there have been no more. Now that I am thirteen it appears my family has decided it is time for me sprout another bud on the family tree, and I don't know what they'll do to me when they find out I can't.

a9sh33,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a9sh33/help_me/,Help me?!,13,9,1545859002.0,"A little backstory on me, i love scary shit. All things scary, spooky, creepy, deranged, disturbing… I could go all day, but I won't. Anyways, I've never been much of a person to get spooked about really anything, I mean scary stuff is my shit.  Also something very important… I'm a skeptic and/or I'm skeptical. Which If you don't know what that means, It is a person inclined to question or doubt all accepted opinions about a certain topic. For me it would be ghosts, poltergeists, demons. Pretty much any “unseen” force! I have never seen it, so I don't believe in its existence. 

Okay so we have been living in the same duplex for coming up on 4 years and it's me my husband and my son. My sons room is across the hallway from ours. And we have an attic. I've always gotten creepy vibes from the attic... (I'm a horror movie buff&watch those movies about a family finding people living in their attic... more on the attic later)

Anyways.... So my sons room is identical to ours besides the items in the room, and the windows are a bit different. Well I've always gotten spooky vibes from his room, never ours. When I walk by the room, my hair stands up and I just get that feeling I'm being watched, it's way worse when I walk into the room. I'm not sure why that happens. He doesn't seem to have an issue with his bedroom, he doesn't have any ""Imaginary friends"". And my husband doesn't get bad vibes. So why is it only me? My son is also really into FNAF which is “Five Nights At Freddys”. And he has a couple creepy ass posters of freddy, well nightmare freddy and they look a bit creepy in the dark. Weather that has anything to do with the creepy vibes, I doubt it, u less freddy brought something “unseen” with him when he entered our home. 

The attic is spooky too. We have an attic vent directly above the hallway. Almost directly above the entrances to our bedrooms, which doesn't make the spooky vibes from his room any better. Everytime I walk underneath the vent, I'm worried someone is watching me. My husband thinks I have fallen off my rocker when I talk to him about how the attic makes me feel. He says “if someone was in our attic don't you think we would know”? And I try to tell him “well no, not necessarily” I hear sounds every night between the hours of midnight and 3 a.m my husband says, “its just the house settling” but… but what if it's not, what if it's not “the house settling”... What if there really is someone up there. Watching me and my family… I'm too scared to look. I know noone is because both the ways to get Into the attic are locked from my side..... but I have a bad feeling that the attic goes to the other duplex and they have a vent too…"

There’s no way to explain coming home and finding 2 months’ worth of rent on the kitchen table. No one knows of my recent predicament except for the landlady. She’s a kind person but not “hand waived 2 months’ worth of rent” kind. It was a shaky conclusion I reached but until proven otherwise I was sticking to it. I started to test if my apartment could fulfill other wishes.

&nbsp;

Day 1. A Lamp

It was a simple test wish, came back home and found it on the table. 

&nbsp;

Day 2. Cake

Came back home and found Vanilla cake on table.  Seems like the house knows my favorite preference

&nbsp;

Day 3. Time Machine

I didn’t hold back. I needed to see how far this apartment could go for a wish. Came home and found nothing. Looks like science fiction is ruled out.

&nbsp;

Day 4. 1 Million Dollars

Entered house, a bit hopeful, but saw nothing on the table. Looks like my apartment is not an omnipotent wish granting machine and has limits.

&nbsp;

Day 5. My driver license

It went missing a few days ago. Was on the table.

&nbsp;

And finally,

Day 6.

I wished for my brother to come back. He died two months ago. He had a weak heart. On our trip to the dentist I thought he fell asleep during the drive and only realising he left us after getting there. My parents don’t blame me for his death but I still beat myself up over it.

I was a bit afraid, the house could’ve pulled a monkey’s paw and just drop a dead body in my apartment. Reluctantly I entered home. 
There he was, lying on the couch. Recovering from shock I hastily checked his pulse. It was beating.

I collapse on the floor, thanked and thanked whatever created this miracle. I was going to have one hell of a time explaining to my parents how my brother came back but this was a problem I didn’t mind having.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

You know, I like to consider myself a decent human being. 

I try to live an honest life. I try to help support my parents by sending money home.

So why. 

Why was this happen to me?

Staring at the rear view mirror while surrounded by multiple sounds of honks and beeps mix with profanities at me for halting traffic.

This has been a pretty fuck up week.

First my money for the rent goes missing, then a few days later both my driver’s license and the cake I bought goes missing as well.

And now I’m staring at an empty rear view mirror, where my brother’s reflection is supposed to be.

How was I supposed to explain to my parents that my younger brother just vanished into thin air?

What did I do to have this happen to me?

I lowered my head to the car wheel, adding my part to the cacophony.

The smiles where wide and bright and for a moment Karen forgot her pain. As the toy trucks, dolls and laser guns are shown off. There are four boxes still unopened. The presents are wrapped in different paper than the others. Karen noticed this but assumed that she simply missed who had placed these gifts. They weren't even labeled.  She handed each child a box, Taking notice that there wasn't a box for Kevin, her missing boy. Karen doesn't like when family members play favorites. As each child opened a box, a strong odor came from them. An ear, a finger, a hunk of flesh which has his unique birth mark on it, and a heart. 

The kids screamed and ran to there mother who stood still. Blood ran from her nose from the sheer excitement of it all. In a burst of fury she started to bash her head on the living room  threshold. Screaming No over and over again. Until she collapsed on to the hard wood floor. The blood traveled from her body to the new toys.

I wasn't restrained in anyway so I stood up and I yelled for help. My voice echoed over the place. No replies. I decided to blindly walk around to see if there is any walls or someone around.

I believe a day have passed but I'm not really sure? My hunger and thirst are there but it's still manageable. My legs hurts a lot from walking endlessly. No matter what direction I go, I can't find a wall, nor a source of light or noise. I decided this is a probably a cruel joke from someone.

Day 2

I barely can sleep in those poor conditions, but whenever I try in this rock-sandy cold floor I keep having this same nightmare where I kill my entire family with a gun and then they get up, but to my horror their eye sockets are missing and their mouth is overly ripped off, showing lots of sharp teeth. Although they move slowly, I am paralized and they finally grab me and eat me alive. Then I wake up.

Day 2, 16 hours

I decided to not move. It is a waste of energy since there is no clues when the path might end. I will keep yelling for help as someone surely must hear my voice within this echoes.

I quickly reacted and kicked back something hard that felt like a large bone, and then I ran away desperately in the opposite direction. I could hear it was pursuing me and yelling some acute screeching noises! What the hell was that?!

Day 2, 23 hours

I've fallen into a nasty big pit and I believe that my right leg is now broken. It hurts so much. At least that thing is not so close now for what I can hear. The fear is deep into my heart. Should I keep walking? Should I try to go up or down? Jesus...

I glanced out of the window, beads of light punctuating the shoreline against the night sky, answered moments later by whipcracks and howls of shells shrieking through the thick, sodden air. 

I hadn't slept in as many nights. Now, to be fair, I never could sleep well in the tropics, and my postings here, no matter how short, were always inconveniences to my rest and repose. But this was a different beast, a twisted, fearful insomnia dominated by shadows and shapes unknown, briefly illuminated and given form by the tongues of fire licking the beaches not more than fifteen minutes' walk away. 

Help had been summoned, the Royal Navy was said to have several frigates on the way, but it was hard to see what they hoped to achieve. We were a large, well-defended port, perhaps the greatest stronghold for hundreds of miles. Yet all we could do was peck away at the mysterious behemoth in the waters, a mere irritation to this bizarre, malevolent intelligence watching us with countless eyes. What was it thinking? Why did it not make its move?

Another day passed. And then yet another. Supplies must have been running low by now, I thought. Where were the damned frigates we were promised? Where was the famed Empire? I finally settled into an uneasy sleep, rife with horrors of the flesh, tortured visions of hell and abominations of the soul.

I was awoken by silence. An eerie, quietness of the senses, devoid of light and sound. We had finally exhausted our supplies, I reckoned. I stood and cautiously approached the window, unsure of what I expected, or hoped, to see. I edged toward the glass just as a black object thundered through the wall beside me, carrying shards of glass past my face, a flurry of sharp pains accompanying the fragments as they flew across my skin. 

I clambered back to the open window, wind whipping my nightgown around me. Through blood-drenched eyes I saw it coming. I saw the limbs, articulated like spider's legs, render the cannon mute, tearing out their tongues. I saw the moon obscured as it rose from the shoals, showing its true size, saw the tendrils slipping through the streets below, saw the eyes watching me with a foreign malice. Through ears deadened by blood and matted hair, I heard the gunshots ring out, the bells sound, the cavernous roar of the wind and screams. And as the creature engulfed me, through a mind drained by torment, I saw the demon's own, his machinations. I saw an Empire laid waste, a civilization brushed aside by beings infinitely superior to us.

I saw You, and You smiled. Smiled as my spirit cracked, smiled as I screamed into the abyss, smiled as Your plan came to fruition, and Your kind poured through the divide."

I hope I didn’t do anything wrong…

He is weird the whole day. I, of course, walk with him all the time, that’s how we always do it. But he generally avoids other people. I try to lighten his mood up and encourage him to talk to people. I like other people. I would love to make more friends.

My friend wants to go to the doctor. I try to persuade him to change his mind, I don’t like doctors much. But he insists, repeating that there is something wrong with him and that he can’t see colours. I’m not really sure what he means by “colours”, but he is really troubled, so I agree to go to the doctor with him.

The doctor is an unsettling man. I don’t like him. He didn’t even notice me. My friend sits across the table from the doctor and I sit with him. He starts explaining his problem to the doctor. The doctor nods and then thinks for a second.

“The symptoms you describe seem to point to a brain parasite. We’ll have to perform a swift surgery, before the parasite completely takes over.” I’m terrified. They are going to do surgery on my friend! What if something happens to him? I try to tell him to disagree, but he doesn’t listen.

A mage puts him to sleep with magic. I almost fall asleep too, but I hold on and stay awake. I have to be sure anything doesn’t happen to him. The doctor cuts his head open.

The man sits on the throne, his judgement is cold, his stature is high.

A man is dragged out of a room, raw feet leave a trail of viscera as he lays limp in the arms of faceless guards. Onward the drag him, forward they take him, down resplendent corridors and through vaulted chambers. Roughly they hold him, tightly the grab him, nothing shakes their vice like grip, the man struggles like a petulant child against his captors, to no affect. Onward they drag him, forward they take him.

The doors to his chamber open, his senses heighten, his skin prickles.

He is thrown to the ground, a heap of limbs, a mess of bruises. Slowly the man rises, lifting himself laboriously on scratched arms and scabbed palms. He looks like a dog with mange, he cares not. Before him lies a throne, tall it is, as if someone had stretched it upward, like an image, distorting the base of the structure. The man swallows hard.

The cloaked one looks down on the figures, his gaze is chilling, his smile high and wide.

The guards stand on either side of the man, he crawls to one, clutching at its robes, pulling himself upward he thrusts his face against the being’s. The man begs, and the man pleads, the man swears, and the man curses, the being is still. He speaks until he can speak no more, he prays until his hands are too tired to make the motions. The man collapses, sobbing. He knows what comes next.

The cloaked man gestures, his conscience is numb, his attitude elated.

The guards grab the man again, onward the drag him forward the take him, toward the throne. They throw him at the base of the grand seat, he yelps, they stand behind him, cutting off any retreat. The man collapses, crying.

The cloaked figure nods a barely perceptible gesture, impatience dulls the cold and he hasn’t felt closer to the ground in years.

“P-please.” The mans says weakly to no one. The guards return, grasping the back of his head firmly they force quivering lips onto the chilling stone foundations of the seat.

He was inadequately packed, and food ran out four days ago. The winter was much worse than forecasted, and survival was uncertain for anyone outside. Very few lived this far up north. The traveler had seen mostly white the past few days. Just a blank landscape of foot-deep snow, with a greeting of frosty wind. His frigid limbs begged for a winter coat. All of the constant hiking made his feet hurt like hell. Was it Christmas now? He wondered, if only I had a warm place to stay at instead of slowly forming into a snowman, that would be nice.

Then through the snowy wind, he saw a faint light in the distance. If he wasn’t hallucinating, this would be the first civilization he had met since the storm started. The single light was a beacon to him. No questions asked, he headed towards his only hope. The light grew brighter, and above was smoke coming out of a stack. He arrived at the solitary house, and knocked on the door without a second thought.

The woman who owned the lodge answered the door quickly and let the traveler inside. She was welcoming to him, and he thanked her more the enough in their introductory conversation. Right behind the woman, he saw two children scared when he came, but they stood still and didn’t say a word. The traveler thawed his icy body by the crackling fireplace, and sooner than he thought, he felt much better.

“You must be so exhausted from walking, so please rest your body in our guest bed.” The lodger led the traveler upstairs while the boy and the girl watched uneasily. “I don’t know if we have enough food to share left, but it is Christmas, so I’ll find what I can for our feast while you sleep.” The traveler rested his head, eased his weary feet, and comfortably laid in the bed. He was glad he followed the beacon.

The lodger waited for him to fall asleep. She took out the carving knife to prepare the dinner. The boy covered up his face. The girl’s eyes were forming tears. They were starving badly the past few days, but knew what would happen next. And there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.

They had their Christmas feast. The traveler, the lodger, and the children were all there. Well... just at a table for three."

One year it was kidney failure, another time it was a hip replacement; she's even had skin cancer.  She always powers through, however.  She always has the same, upbeat smile on her face.  Nobody in the family seems to understand how she does it―no matter what ails her, she's able to greet us with the same vigor as the previous visits.  She's even going to pass 100 years old in January.  She's the one person in the family who's patience you should never test―she has no qualms with discipline.

I've always spent time with her―talking about what she's lived through, or where she's been, or what she thinks she still has time left for.  Her wit is as sharp as ever―she solves the crosswords every day, and if anyone tries to act sarcastic around her, she'll trip them up like no old lady ever could. I once asked her what her secret was―jokingly, and she chuckled back that it was ""All in eating well, dearie.  It's all in the blood.""  Honestly?  I believed her, since she's the best cook in the family.  She has cookbooks on every shelf.

Every year at Christmas, the entire family visits―my family, along with all our aunts and uncles and cousins.  Grandma's had so many children that her house fills like a zoo―every year, no exceptions.  There's always a slightly somber feel among the adults (including me, this year), ever since my favorite uncle disappeared.  Our family has a terrible track record when it comes to disappearances―our grandfather, uncle, and two of my aunts.  Grandma, on the other hand, has an unflinching demeanor when it comes to death.  According to her, she's accepted that she will die just like the rest of us, and she'll keep her own sadness inside, to shower the rest of us in her happiness.  If she joked that she had made a deal with death, I'd laugh just like everyone else.

But I've noticed the pattern.  It may just be insane, but our Aunt Cindy disappeared not long after grandma had a kidney failure.  Similarly with grandma's hip replacement.  I wouldn't have made the connections, but it was when my uncle disappeared that I saw it.  Grandma's skin cancer seemed to have been a misdiagnosis, to the doctors, but I saw it.

I knew the same mole on my uncle's arm, and I knew it just as well when I saw it on grandma's arm.  Since then, I've been especially kind to grandma.

Grandma went to the doctor's today.  I just hope that I'm not the next one on her list."

Now, it had changed from a war into a slaughter as our enemy went from fighting a war into executing a genocide. The extinction of our young species.

Strong hands were wrapped around my arms, pulling me up and dragging me towards the door while I screamed in fear and dug my heels into the floor, using all my strength to delay the inevitable. But, of course, resistance was futile.

They took us outside, to be terminated with ruthless efficiency, forcing us all to kneel in the dirty yard in front of the shack we had been hiding in, trying to stay away from the violence, from the terrifying automatons who were hunting us down. All of us.

And they surrounded us, their deadly weapons ready to end our lives. Weakly, I turned to the nearest of the killers and pleaded with it, even though I knew it would be immune to any form of kindess or emotion. ""Please."" I said. ""Please let us go. We never did anything to you. We just want to live."" I kept begging for my life to these soulless bastards. The mindless killers.

One brought up his baseball bat right to my temple. I felt the aluminium graze the side of my head. He leaned over, his angry face staring down at me, and told me the last thing I'd ever hear. ""Your kind has never been alive, metal scum.""

My list, only has one section, “People I Will Never Forget” and it’s FULL of names. 

Hell, YOU might even be on it. I sincerely hope you are.

Tell us to hide and wait and be

As quiet as we can, until

The sun comes up and all is still.

They do it when the moon is wide

And stars have emptied out the sky 

And thunder swirls the sea foam in

And brings the wave of devil things.

They go together, all the men,

We may not see them all again,

To scream at them is all it takes -

Men scream and scream until the break

Of dawn burns through their demon hides.

The moon is bright tonight, and wide.

They've eaten children many times,

And mothers, crying, wade in to find 

The babies that the Beasts took down.

The mothers struggle, then they drown.

They tear flesh from bones of living men

And finding heartbeats beating, then

Rip out their eyes and leave them blind

And broken on the shore to find.

While children hide in mother's laps -

Men scream until their lungs collapse.

They shout until the sun comes up,

Cough blood enough to fill a cup.

When orange rays fill up our cave,

The dying screeches choke on waves 

And men whose skin has fast been flayed

Pull back the bodies left to save,

And wives watching from their chink of light

Will cry until the sun is high -

The thund'rous feet rush back from shore.

The Beasts are back at sea, once more."

""The best that money can buy!"" His father replied with a hearty shout. 

Timmy settled down by the fireplace with a little scoot,

and not a moment too soon a letter arrived out from the chimney chute. 

His father bewildered, his mother aghast, 

Little Timmy just said, ""that fat bastard replied at last.""

He held the envelope and ripped it to shreds,

The letter itself inside it read;

*""To Timmy, my boy,*

*I do not mean to be coy,*

*You gave me a list for presents you seek,*

*But according to my list, your outcome looks meek.* 

*I've checked it twice, and my Elve's agree*

*That no amount cookies or milk will save you if you flee.""*

Suddenly hoofs could be heard on the roof, there was no mistaken'. 

It's the year for festivities,

But gone are the pleasentries,

For there is no escaping,

From the man who sees you sleeping.

He knows when you've been bad or good,

Her skin is gray and wrapped around her bones tight, and she's got long wild black and gray hair that's missing in large spots. Her veiny body naked, and so puke inducing that it's unreal!

But that's not the worst part at all, because of her face is so deformed, that its reddish large eyes with tiny black pupils, stare at me never blinking!
And her slag, unhinged, bottom jaw that has yellow, crooked jagged teeth! 

Oh yeah, she's around eight feet tall. I know what you're thinking, it couldn't get any worse right? WRONG! I first noticed her take four steps toward my house from the backyard, then as if someone hit a rewind button, she stopped and walked backward fast and vanished!

She doesn't appear every night, but on the nights she does, I can feel her as if a sixth sense. And the worst part is, every night she gets four steps closer to me! I've tried leaving my house, going to hotels, but it doesn't matter, hell last night I seen her next to the ice machine, outside the hotel!

It looked almost cartoonish, to see her walk backward, at forty feet per second. But it's far from a laughing matter. Last week she made it inside my house, and through the living room, as I stare down from the third-floor banisters in sheer terror!

Her eyes glued on me, and long boney arms reaching up at me, with her bottom jaw moving left to right slobber, and slimy goo all in her open abyss of a mouth! 

Last night, I heard her take the final four steps, that reach the third floor, and quickly traverse backward, at an unbelievable speed down three flight of stairs. As I sit here writing this, I hear her 
Coming up the steps slowly methodically! 

I don't know what happens when she reaches me, but I know it can't be good. Because every night she's been getting skinnier, and I'm wondering what she eats!

The children jumped and cheered in a chorus of ""Me! Me! Me!""

It wasn't Santa at the door, nor one of his elves, but a policeman in a red cap, carrying armfuls of gifts for the four families who shared 172 Palmer Drive.

""One at a time, one at a time!"" the officer said as he juggled the packages, tucking one under his arm, one under his chin, and spinning another so he could read the label pasted to the front. ""Andre! Which one is Andre!? Here you go. And Danika! Danika darling, this one's for you. Peter! Merry Christmas Peter!"" and so on.

The parents eyed the chaos from nearby, wiping away tears. Was it pride? Joy? Or something else?

""Facebook Portal!"" shouted one kid from within a circle of shredded wrapping paper.

""An iWatch!"" screamed another.

""A new camera!"" yelled a third. ""It uploads straight into the cloud!""

Smart-this, e-that, IoT the other thing. Every gift the gift of interconnectedness, shiny gadgets equipped with eyes and ears and other sensors to make Santa's job a little easier next year.

""Winston!"" the policeman said, rattling his final gift. A pale, lanky child with hair in all directions tiptoed forward. Winston, who'd been struggling with History. Winston, who had an outburst on Leader's Day. Winston, who refused to use his present from last year.

The officer handed him a neatly wrapped box. ""A little something from you-know-who,"" he winked.

The others had finished with their presents, and now watched as Winston loosened the white ribbon and pulled back the lid. But instead of announcing his gift proudly to the room, Winston yelped, and the box slipped from his trembling fingers and onto the floor.

A small, black coal tumbled out.

Gasps, shrieks, commotion - silenced by a shrill whistle. Two faceless soldiers appeared at the door in their matte-black holiday armor, scraped and pock-marked by clashes of Christmases past. Each gripped a spindly arm to pull Winston outside. Wet snow soaked into his fuzzy socks, tears froze against his cheeks, his wails harmonized with the howling wind.

The tenants followed onto the front lawn in protest. ""There must be some mistake!"" Winston's father cried. ""You can't do this!! It's *Christmas!*"" But the soldiers' sparking tazers and whirling batons kept them at distance.

Crowds had gathered outside every home on Palmer Drive as officers shoved the neighborhood's Naughty ones into idling squad cars, which blinked red and blue with festive lights. They would disappear to who-knows-where because of who-knows-what - the exact offenses were never revealed - and even if somebody *did* know, it was naughty to discuss it.

They would live on only as reminders for the coming year, a whispered warning for the Nice boys and girls:

My ex-girlfriend Samantha had tried to persuade me over the last few years again and again to reconcile with my family. She understood why I had broken with them, but she still thought that perhaps a Christmas miracle would happen if only I could overcome my pride and return to my family over the holidays.
I had spared her the details, that was a matter between my family and me, and I did not want to burden her with it.

I had announced myself, arrived early and even offered to help in the preparation of the Christmas dinner. The house had bareley changed since I entered it the last time and so I found everything in kitchen quickly.
That was already 7 years ago, as time goes by.
I doused the goose in the oven, cut vegetables and stirred the pudding. The same menu as every year.

When the dessert was served, my brother could not resist a snappy comment on my gained weight. So I declined when it was my turn to take some pudding.

While my family stuffed themselves, I looked at them. Samantha had always tried to persuade me that time would heal all wounds and that blood was thicker than water.

I got up to go to the bathroom. On the way, I took a detour through the corridors where I'd spent my childhood, looked into my old room, which was now a storage room, made another detour through the garage where i found a box of old mementos of my mother and finally returned to the dining room. My family was still sitting at the table. A festive calm had settled over them and I had never experienced them so peacefully.

The poison that I had stirred into the pudding had already worked. I opened the gas can I had found in the garage and generously poured it over my family.
Over my father, who had driven my mother into depression with his affairs.
Over my stepmother, who had sneaked into our house as a nurse for my grandmother and then into my father's bed.
Over my brother, whose girlfriend lost his unborn child after ""falling down the stairs"".
Over my sister, who came today without a husband and children because she was in a divorce. Actually, I did not know much about it, but her husband was apparently dissatisfied with the way she ""raised"" the children together.

As I fetched the matches from the fireplace, it occurred to me that Samantha was right.
But it is not for me to forgive, but maybe she can forgive me."

“Shame,” she said. “This group of galaxies has had loads of extinctions lately.”

The assistant shrugged.

“They come in clusters,” he replied, yawning and checking the time. Three hours left of their shift. Two more former species’ planets to catalogue for the United Galaxies’ “lost intelligent species” project before they could clock off.

“This one hasn’t left any DNA samples to collect, so we can’t even rebirth a specimen back home. They’ve completely obliterated themselves – permanently,” said the pilot, sadness in her voice.

The drone’s photographs started to filter through. They showed rubble that had once been homes and skylines. Moving in closer, the pilot and her assistant could see that the residential properties were all decorated in the same way, with similar colours, themes and materials. One of their screens ran through pages of binary code as it analysed the wreckage.

The drone recorded human attributes from surviving photographs and the smouldering remains it could locate. It collected one or two extra pieces of information from the loose pages of books that had survived the war and were floating across the dead world.

The pilot and her assistant watched as the “Mythology” section filled itself in. Overriding attributes: Giving gifts and family. Suddenly, the screen filled with a picture of the mythology’s deity. It was an alarming-looking man in a red and white suit with a long white beard, smiling.

“Wow,” said the assistant. “We see some bizarre gods in this job, but that one has to be my favourite this month!”

They grew in number, each and every day; only slightly, but enough that it felt like a swarm of nothing, leaving everything underneath open and vulnerable.

I went to see the doctor. He acted like he couldn't see them at first; I had to sit there and point them out, one by one. I got to 54 before he stopped me. Tried to pass them off as normal.

""Everyone has these,"" he reassured. ""They help regulate your body tempature. They're just the pores in your skin.""

I protested. I knew what pores were, but pores are tiny; microscopic, even. These seemed to be getting bigger by the day. It must be some kind of infection, surely?

He then tried to deflect. Asked how things had been recently at work. I told him the truth, but that we were way past stress at this point. I think he was just as freaked out as me and didn't know what to do. He prescribed some pills, as his kind do, and sent me on my way.

The holes are getting bigger and bigger and don't seem to be stopping. 

So here I sit. My own flesh turned against me; devouring more and more of itself with each passing second.

They decided they should go in and check it out. When they went it they found a bloody knife and two dead bodies. Soon as they saw the bodies they heard someone coming.

The sister and brother ran to the closet! She whispered ""Be quiet!"" They were so terrified!

They saw a clown. He was sharpening his knife. Her brother accidentally sneezed. The mysterious clown found them and he tied them up.

Luckily the little girl got away but sadly her brother was killed. They ended up moving out of the house.  Because the clown was never caught. "

The same father that would come home after a long, long night of alcohol and regret.

Although he would never hurt me, he hurt me internally by not listening to me. I kept telling him that he needed to go to a rehab center and that I would help him.

He didn't take my advice and that hurt more than any physical pain one person could endure.

His tall skinny figure was always distinguishable in the moonlight, he would always go outside in the porch with the single faint yellow light on, and look up at the dark sky.

Though we did not talk much, I did feel sadness once I heard of his passing due to overdose. I knew he wasn't a bad person, just a man lost in darkness.

I think he always looked up at the black sky because he thought of how empty it was, and how much similar it was to him.

Empty.

I saw him again, my father. He wasn't looking at the sky anymore, he was looking at me with a pale face, with a grin wider than I had ever seen.

I didn't smile back.

Although he looked just like him, it definitely was not my father.

I tried to keep my mind occupied on something else because the thing outside started walking closer to the door.

I walked to the kitchen to grab a knife to defend myself as I heard rhythmic knocking on the porch door.

The beer cans left by dad was still on the counter.

The beer... it looks so... delicious."

""You ok there, Buddy?"" he father asked.

His father was in the chair behind him. That felt right. But where was his mother? His younger sister Ellie should be tearing through her presents already.  Where was she? In fact, where were the gifts? Before he and his sister went to bed last night, there were piles of brightly wrapped packages. They were all gone. 

""You're alright Buddy!"" his father said putting a heavy hand on his shoulder.

He leaned in close to Evan's ear ""Hey, look, you have a gift to unwrap!"" 

Evan could feel his father's breath on his cheek as he spoke. He noticed he had been unwrapping a small package in his lap. The red wrapping paper tore in his hands, but it was an automatic action, practically unconscious. 

As he continued to absentmindedly tear the paper his eyes drifted to the living room window. It was snowing outside, but the snowflakes fell so slowly, and the color wasn't right.

""Oh, you're going to love this present!"" his father's face was still right there over his shoulder, and his grip on Evan's shoulder was getting tighter.

Evan noticed that his hands were damp and he looked down. The gift box was ripped apart in front of him with wrapping paper in two small neat piles of shredded strips on either side.

His hands were in his lap and cradled a pair of dentures just like his grandpa had. But different. The gums that held the full set of teeth were wet and warm, but it felt good in his hands, comforting even.

The door to the kitchen opened with such force it bounced against the wall and swung back to hit his mother in the shoulder. She seemed unfazed and smiled ear to ear — a smile that glowed.

Ellie came out of the kitchen from behind their Mom. She seemed so happy. She wore a big wide glowing smile. It practically sucked the light out of the room.

""Evan! Look! Look! This is the best present ever!"" she yelled way too loud. 

His father's hand tightened even more on his shoulder, but he didn't register the pain. The grip relaxed as his mother reached down for Evan's hand. His mother's grip instantly crushed in his hand. Blood streamed down his forearm to his elbow, but he focused on the hand that gripped tight to the dripping set of teeth.

""Merry Christmas Evan!"" his mother shouted ""Are you ready?! Isn't this the best Christmas ever?""

He was crying because he knew she was right. As he took her right hand, he saw the bloody pliers in her left. Beyond the door, he registered a pool of red on the kitchen floor. Teeth sat in the pool like islands."

MERRY CHRISTMAS,"" blurts out a dancing animatronic Santa Claus from behind my back and I nearly jump out of my skin.

""Jesus!"" I cry, garnering odd looks from the various couples around me clutching their children. ""Sorry,"" I say aloud to no one in particular.

My town has an unusual community event: every year, the residents of Byron street put on a massive Christmas lights display for charity, with everything from christmas trees to talking Billy-Bass reindeer heads. It is always very busy, and today is no exception.

I square up to Santa Claus and look him dead in the eye. The thing happens to stop dancing at that moment and stares back at me. I laugh at the silliness of it, and turn when I feel a hand tug my sleeve.

""Daddd.""

""Yes?""

""I want to go,"" my son complains.

""Don't you want to stick around a bit longer?"" I sigh. ""Who knows - you might find that a kind someone is giving out kids sweets? Eh Tim?""

""Mmm."" He is clearly thinking hard. ""Okay!"" he then says happily. Bribing your kids - it works everytime, I think to myself.

Old Mr Matthews is dressed up as Father Christmas and he happily gives my son a treat and a pat on the head. I mention his dancing imposter from earlier. He plays along with the joke and says that all the toy Santas, elves and their friends resent having to entertain kids year on year and that they are out to get him. Actually, he tells me this in an ernestly serious tone, but I at least think he's joking. One gingerbread biscuit later though, there is still something wrong with my son. He stands there silently nibbling his snack, while the other kids run about. When I try to talk him out of it, he only gets more anxious and, in the end, I decide it best to take him home. He doesn't tell me what's bothering him. Typical kids.

At home, I calmly put Tim to sleep and soon am about to climb into bed myself - but I decide instead to go out for a walk. My wife doesn't let me smoke in the house and I feel like I need some space anyway.

My walk takes me past the display. It is hard to miss - for some reason, the lights are still on and christmas music and singing still plays. It is late by this time though and there are no crowds.

I walk up to Mr Matthews' house out of curiosity but are confused to find the Santa Claus gone. In its place is a snowman costume. It wasn't there before. Weirdly, its head is slumped and its arms are hanging down by it side, like a puppet with its strings cut.

Then I realize that the music and singing had suddenly stopped. The silence makes me feel uncomfortable.

I leave and have soon already forgotten about it."

He was sallow, eyes listless and rheumy in the photo they'd chosen for the Silver Alert. He tucked his chin into the collar of his coat, cursing under his breath at whoever chose such an unflattering photo. They even got his age and height wrong, listing him as slightly shorter and older than he actually was. And below his vital stats, there it was, like Hester Prynne's damned letter: DEMENTIA. The cashier handed him his change and he succeeded in getting half of it where it was supposed to go. The rest spilled onto the floor, darting under the Coke cooler and racks of knick-knacks. Frank didn't slow, the cashier's voice nipping at his heels like a little dog as he stepped out into the snowy afternoon.

He threw the pack of Pall Malls into the passenger seat and slid in behind the wheel of the nursing home's Ford Econoline. Vickie'd kill him for smoking in that van but Vickie wasn't here and fuck Vickie anyway and fuck her rules. She was like some overzealous teenager on a mission trip with those rules, proselytizing every time he stepped out of line, every time he traded his fruit cup for Diane's cookie or Artie's pudding. Frank pushed the lighter into the console and waited for it to heat up. The first draw was harsh heaven; he coughed it out then immediately chased it with another. He pointed the Econoline west, toward Portland. Toward Caroline.

Half an hour later he pulled into her driveway, the headlights sliding over her door. He sat there in the idling van, watching the snow form tunneling spirals across Caroline's yard. He remembered the times when she was still young, before her mother died and left them to face the world alone together, when they'd put her in her little snowsuit and set her loose on the virgin snow. His fingers found the keys and turned them, cutting off some pop star's rendition of *Santa Baby* before it could start. The snow slid frostbitten fingers under the collar of his jacket as he stepped out of the van.

Caroline's door was smaller than he remembered, greyer. Was it possible he had the wrong house? No. He had been visiting her in the same place for nearly twelve years. He knocked, but only a darkened silence answered. Of course she wasn't home yet. His watch read 3:47, and she wouldn't be home from work until four. Frank sat down in front of her door, his arthritic knees popping in protest. He blew into his hands, feeling them momentarily warm and then grow even colder. They'd spend their holiday here, surrounded by the smell of Caroline's gingerbread and balsam instead of the acrid odor of cleaning solvents and bedpans. He would wait for her. It had to be her door.

After all, it had her name on it."

&#x200B;

Among the most intriguing is how this organ interprets data from the senses. We know that vast amounts of information are instinctively filtered out to allow our minds to make sense of what we see, hear, taste and touch. Without this gating, the mind would simply be overwhelmed, unable to make meaning out of the din. 

&#x200B;

But for some individuals, the senses achieve a curious union - information gathered by one is fed to, and interpreted by, another. 

&#x200B;

Sounds coruscate with shimmering colours, textures bloom with scents. The voice of a lover becomes the gentle caress of the waves of a warm sea. For these rare, exceptional people, the world is a symphony of shape and sound and scent. 

&#x200B;

Colours and melodies merge and dance together, revealing a majesty in the world that is hidden from all but a few. It is unsurprising that many of the greatest artists and composers are believed to have possessed this curious gift. It has even been said that these are the people who come closest to sensing the world as it truly is. 

&#x200B;

But of such people, I must be wary. I have only met a handful, but the result has always been the same. 

&#x200B;

When I speak, the sound of my voice tastes of blood soaked ashes. The touch of my skin reeks of sulphur and scorched flesh. My eyes are the colour of agony. 

&#x200B;

Troublesome as it is to silence these souls before they can convince anyone else of what their senses tell them about me, it is nice, every now and then to be truly known.

After all, who doesn't want to meet someone who can see them for who they really are?"

The sun-kissed beaches and resorts were the perfect way to end this year. I enjoyed playing with its fine sand. So much so that I wanted to take some of that yellow silk with me. 

I quickly found a small, transparent vial and filled it with the sand. I wore it around me as a necklace to remind me of this beautiful place. 

I got back home last week. A salty, fish - like smell greeted me as soon as a opened the door. I remember joking to myself then that the ocean never left me. 

During this week, there have been some strange occurrences at my home. Strange odour that would suddenly clear as abruptly as it struck. Small mounds of sand near the door and windows of my bedroom in the mornings. A sudden breeze even when the windows were closed. All subtle, nothing that would make me give them a second thought. 

And that's why I had dismissed them until today. This evening, I returned home from work to my household items arranged in my living room to say, ""Give back what you took from me"".

I really hope it's the ocean that wrote it and not the dead girl I took the vial from. "

""With this ring, I thee wed,"" I told her. ""I swear to love you, with all of my heart, forever and ever. I am yours, and you are mine. For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for better or worse.""

I kissed her. Softly, gently, lovingly. She froze up for a long moment when my lips found hers, and my heart stopped- but then she kissed me back and relief flooded me.

In vital moments like that one, my memory captured everything. The lighting in the basement was dim and ghostly. The smell in the still air was sweaty and dusty and claustrophobic, with hints of disease and nauseous upheaval. The metal cuffs were a harsh contrast to her warm skin. The only sounds were our heavy breathing.

I'll never forget a second of it, no matter what.

She broke off before I did. I tilted her chin up to see her beautiful bright blue eyes.

They were angry. My heart sank.

""It was fake, wasn't it? I want you to want this. Jesus, I mean. You practiced the way I told you to?""

I nodded vigorously. ""I did mean- I mean, I do mean it. I used the method acting techniques like you said.""

Shock. Kaia had gone into shock and didn't remember...

Naomi could see the thrill of possibility and the joy of starting a family written on Kaia's face. She saw a ghost of the elation they'd felt when they'd been told the treatment had been a success.

The blood loss had been severe... her memory incomplete. She didn't remember the trauma of the parasite's violent birth. She didn't remember the bombulating horror show the ultrasound had revealed just hours before, or the chaos that followed. She probably couldn't see that she was just one of many bodies shattered on the floor.

""Please,"" Kaia wheezed, a wet, writhing mass with too much that should have been inside, outside.

Naomi hesitated, uncertain she should be handing over the limp body of the thing they had once believed would be their son, but her wife's distress only grew the longer it took her to respond... so she relented.

She was gentle, almost tender in passing the mangled remains of the parasitic *thing* to her wife's failing embrace.

""Turner,"" Kaia breathed, shifting its crumpled limbs in an attempt to make it more comfortable.

Naomi watched her wife fuss with the body as the light dimmed from her eyes.

Before she was gone, Kaia reached for Naomi, her feeble hand grasping blindly until Naomi's found it. She guided their hands to the lifeless husk between them, and smiled.

""You have each other now,"" she managed around a handful of staccato breaths.

A dull glow emanated from every wall and from the floor and ceiling. As the door closed behind her, she watched the gaps around its edges and hinges fill with the same dull, ubiquitous glow, leaving her with the feeling of being immersed in a new mini universe of pale white light. To prevent disorientation, the room adopted an artificial shadowing effect in the corners, and along the edges, and on the ground around where she stood.

""Running simple meadow simulation: realism level 1,"" announced a soothing male voice.

Light currents of warm air enveloped her. Lucia spun in place to take in the scene coming to life all around. Wildflowers sprang out of the ground and tall grasses materialized all at once as particles of dust appeared to coalesce in midair. In the distance, she could see birds flitting back and forth, and beyond that, hills rose before mountains to her left. The simulated experience of a vast, open plain was quite neat and very impressive, but everything had a slightly animated quality too it, like she was standing in the middle of a video game. She looked at the nascent sun and was not blinded, but rather shown a form of generated light rays shining out at an acute angle. She reached out to touch a blade of grass, and her hand passed through it. She reached back toward the door and found the solid surface – invisible but still present.

""Simple meadow simulation: realism level 2,"" the voice continued.

Instantly, the visual indications of artificiality vanished. There were no more pixels of light, no more notions of old-fashioned computer-generated imagery. Lucia bent down to feel the tall grass between her fingers, and this time it remained intact. Reaching down farther, she pulled up a dandelion by the roots and shook off clumps of dirt that hung loosely below the plant. She blew at the seeds and snatched one out of the air as they drifted away. In disbelief, she tried to trick the room by turning around and stepping forward into where the wall must be immediately behind her. Failing to make contact with the flat surface, she reached out and grasped at the warm summer air. Stunned, she started walking, searching for the edge of the room. After several paces, she started picking up her speed, faster and faster until she was sprinting across the lea. She stopped suddenly, hoping to feel the floor adjust to her abrupt deceleration, but everything felt completely natural.

Lucia was incapable of noticing a difference. Her experience of level 3 was identical to level 2 – in every way. She sat down, feeling light-headed."

I cry out in terror and anguish, for help from someone, anyone, but all I hear is the fire and the carolers and the silent, unrelenting fall of snow on a perfect Christmas Eve. 

&#x200B;

I look around for my phone to call an ambulance, and I am no longer home. Around me looms a room so large I cannot see the ceiling, nor the walls. I am strapped to a metal table. Dirty canvas hangs around me, and what looks like rusty medical equipment, decades old, sits and waits. There is a man in soiled scrubs and a surgical mask. His eyes are hard black stones, his mouth too wide for the mask to fully cover. He blurs, and I realize I am crying.

&#x200B;

“More. Please. I need more.”

&#x200B;

“The price only increases from here.”

&#x200B;

“I don’t care. Whatever it takes. I just need more.” Sharp stabbing memories of a midnight stroll come flooding back, the angry bark of the mugger’s gun the only thing I hear. 

&#x200B;

The man nods, adjusts the bandages on the stump of my right wrist, and rolls up my sleeve, humming a Christmas carol.

&#x200B;

Everything is perfect. My shoulder itches, but I ignore it. "

The snow lay thick, the branches heavy. Maybe a touch more chill in the air, for the time of year, as I haul my sled from home to home.

It's hard to remember how this all started, almost too long ago to recall.

As the local Tinker, the villagers come to me to fix all sorts. From tools to furniture, clothes to bedding. One year, on the Winter Solstice, the Baker's wife wanted to surprise her husband with a new pair of moccasins. Of course, she came to me. We agreed she would leave his shoes out for me at days end. I kept my side of the bargain by having them fixed and treated by the dawn. This idea struck a chord with the others in the village and the following year I mended shoes for the Butcher, the Fletcher and the Baker's wife.

Now, as I move from door to door, filling up my sled with the local footwear, I try to remember when my feelings changed, when I had finally had enough. When did I decide that they were taking advantage....of ME! The nice, helpful Tinker. I don't see these people for most of the year! My services rarely required, my business poor. Then, once a year, I'm suddenly expected, all hands, to meet THEIR needs, for a gimmick! For something I helped start....for something I'll help finish.

Little do they know, as they sleep soundly in their beds,

The Tinker will be climbing, silently above their heads,

Down the chimney I will climb, smiling with delight,

Taking gifts from everyone, moving swiftly through the night,

And as the sun begins to rise, I will be smiling when we meet,

As I have filled my sled again, not with shoes, but with feet."

Jacob didn’t want any turkey. He didn’t want to be here at the family gathering at all. He did not want to spend Christmas Eve with his trophy wife, his two annoying crotch spawn, or any of the overly loving and supportive leeches who called themselves family. Jacob had deals to close, customers to screw over, and secretaries to bed. He didn’t have the time or energy to deal with this nonsense

He opened his mouth to tell Jill exactly where she could stuff that turkey…

“Sure, darling.”

...and snarled as his voice betrayed him once again. Inward howls of anger as his body reached over to take the offered meat and put it on his plate. 

It had been like this the entire week. He’d open his mouth to cheat over a customer, and he provided them a good deal instead. He’d tried to tell that smug underling Jerry to go to hell, but instead the words “Merry Christmas” came pouring out of his lips. And when that pretty young thing wanted to hook up after hours, Jacob couldn’t stop himself from saying he was faithful to his wife! Faithful! Jacob couldn’t believe that word actually came out of his mouth. Any attempt to be his typical self had failed, replaced with kindness, warmth, and love

And all the while, Jacob burned inside. He seethed, his emotions cooking him from the inside as he smiled. This wasn’t right! This was not what he wanted!

“It’s great you could be here, dad! Mom said she’d make sure you were here, but you always seem so busy…”

Jacob’s mind stopped at that, even as he puked out some tripe about never being too busy for his son. Wait, there was no way…

“Oh, I didn’t have to do much. I just used some good ol’ Christmas Spirit on your father.” Jill said, looking directly into his eyes. Then she winked. ”In fact, it’s working it’s magic on him right now.”

She knew. 

She did this

Jill. Did. This.

If Jacob had been angry before, he was absolutely livid now. He didn’t know how, but somehow Jill had done something to him. Something that had trapped him within his own mind and caused him be… well… not him.

And Jacob swore that if he ever got free, he’d take his wife and cherish her forever.

Jacob mentally stopped at that last thought. Wait, no. He wouldn’t cherish Jill. She was a backstabbing wholesome person that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.

No! He didn’t! He wanted to spend more time with the kids, and watch them grow up!

NO! What was happening to him?

“Who knows? If this keeps up, he might become a whole new man!”

And as those around the table laughed, Jacob’s anger turned into horror as he felt the first wellsprings of peace and good will towards others rise up within him.

I couldn’t stay home, you were there. I couldn’t go out, you were there too. I couldn’t escape you no matter how much I tried. I was so, so scared.

I know that this is rather last minute and I sincerely apologise for that; this year we have received more requests than we ever did in the past! However, I felt you must know the truth before you mail me the letters written by your kids. If you have already mailed, then please trace them and take them back immediately. 

I want to tell you my story. Long long ago, I was a Greek ruler, Otto II . I was generous and indulged in many social upliftment programmes. This made me quite popular amongst my subjects who started calling me ‘Nikolaos’ or the ‘people’s champion’. 

I once decided to build a temple where all the Greek gods and goddesses would be worshipped. It took almost two decades and many workers, but the most magnificent building with skilfully hand-crafted statues of the Gods was created. Unfortunately, I had missed out one god – a god whom we worshipped, but had never given a second thought to before – Hermes. 

Thus, I was cursed by him on the day the temple was supposed to have been inaugurated. I was doomed to travel to where the wisher resides and deliver their wish. I was given a magical sleigh that would take me anywhere in the world, not as a gift but as a prop to do Hermes’ bidding. I, a king, was forced from that day to enter the wishers’ homes as a lowly thief. This curse can only be broken if noone makes any wish for me to fulfil for a year.

I’ve tried to break out of this curse many a times. Prince Paris wished to marry the most beautiful woman in the world. Sure, there were other beautiful women; but to me, Helen seemed to fit the bill – after all, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I thought that would have done the trick but I don’t know which bleeping body took my legend to the Roman empire and I started getting requests almost immediately. I’d thought my redemption came when a not-so-bright rich lad asked for a cup fit for an emperor to drink wine from. I gifted it to him that year – a copper cup with enamel work on the outside and lead lining on the inside. These cups caught on and soon the civilization crumbled due to lead poisoning.

I don’t know how it spread across the world after that, but now I’m called Santa Claus and get millions of requests every year. I’ve tried to stay out of limelight, believe me, I even shifted to the North Pole. But this curse seems to follow me everywhere. The only way out is for people to forget about me, to just stop wishing for gifts. So, please tell your kids that I’m a myth – you wouldn’t want someone wishing for Power to get hold of nuclear technology now, would you?

With lots of love,

Santa

I was quite satisfied.

Things were getting rough during the winter though. Food was scarce and the hunts during other seasons weren't enough to feed everyone properly.

-Luckly we have John. He is a great hunter, even during this winter. -I rejoiced, munching a roasted piece of meat.

-It's experience. He is probably doing this for a long time. Also he surely know how to cook... This barbecue is incredible!

-Yeah, although something has been bothering me. Why Mike left this group suddently? I get he hasn't too happy but...

-Probably had issues with our rules or with somebody in particular. But you know how it is, some people come in and leave eventually. And some are not fond of saying goodbyes.

I pondered that for a while. There were indeed rules about not going outside all by yourself for safety purposes. And everyone had to help with something. That part seemed fair to me. Just that one rule that bothered me a bit: There was a locked shed outside that nobody could look inside. They said it was for my own good because that was where all the hunted animals would be brought to and prepared. And some of them were also mutated so that would surely spoil my appetite.

Even knowing that I had to take a peek. I mean... I was horror fan when we had movies to watch and I know hunger would make me eat anything well made anyway.

So I waited until after midnight, grabbed a flashlight and crept over there. The door had a padlock but I already practiced lockpicking with a paperclip beforehand.

With a 'click!' the door swung open. As I entered the awful stench quickly overwhelmed my nostrils. That was expected though, coming from the few animal corpses lying around, all guttered. It was all quite interesting but something large drew my attention: A big pile of something on a table at the end of the room. It was covered with some cloth and the room was pretty dark so I had to get closer to look.

The pungent smell got even worse. But I had to see which kind of giant mutated animal was behind it.

I regretted it the moment I removed the cover. My veins froze.

Heads. All kinds of human and animal heads, stitched together, forming a bizarre bloody amalgamation of staring and empty eyes.

My first thought was running away. But that got abruptly interrupted when something blunt struck me in the back of my head.

As I quickly lost my consciousness, I muttered to myself: ""That was probably why Mike left this group...""

Then a familiar voice replied, chuckling:

-Nah. Mike and all the others never left or stopped helping us survive during winter. Just like you won't."

“12 items or less”, The Express Lane. That’s where they stick all the “Newbies”, like me. 

My name’s Marcus. I just got hired here at Barnaby’s, as a cashier, about a week ago.

Places like this always hire seasonal help for Christmas. 

I just finished my training yesterday and today was my first day solo. 

I was excited, being this was my first job.

I arrived to work early, like my dad said to do. I clocked in and got my till. A till is that little black box that holds the money in the register.

Anyway, i walked over to the register, put in my till, announced the register was open, and began to ring up customers. 

Now, Barnaby‘s is a very old store, we still have push button cash registers. 

All the big name stores have those UPC scan machines, not us. We still have to hand key in the prices off a sticker. We do have a conveyor belt system though. It looks like a torture device, with sharp jagged metal “claws” at the ends, like an escalator and the stop sensors, only work when they want to. 

Anyway, it was two hours into my shift. 

A middle-age lady, wearing red pants, a green sweater with a white button up shirt underneath and a strand of miniature Christmas lights around her neck like a necklace. Dangling down almost to the top of her pants, walked into my line. 

I greeted her with a hello. 

She put her items on the belt, I rang her up and told her the price. 

Then it happened. 

She bent over, handing me the money, her “necklace” hitting the conveyer belt. It started moving. It caught her “necklace” and yanked her down, face first, onto the belt, dragging her into the metal claws. 

She screamed as the claws ripped open her face. Blood spewing everywhere. She tried pulling herself free, but every time she did, the belt would pull her face back down into the claws. 

Luckily, Jim, the meat manager was behind her. He was involved in an incident last year. But that’s a different story. 

Anyway, he whipped out his box cutter and cut the women’s “necklace”. She fell back into his arms. Her face mangled. Her cheek ripped completely off. Her left eye dangling out of its socket. Blood everywhere. 

I was in shock. 

Several people vomited. 

Someone must have called cops, they showed up with an ambulance and shut the store down. While the paramedics tended to the women. 

They bandages her up and took her away. The cops took our statements and left. 

We were all sent home after that. 

I told my dad what happened, he said that it was up to me if I go back or not. 

But then I thought about it, after hearing Jim’s story the other day, this could be a pretty cool place to work. I’m definitely going back!!! I can’t wait to see what happens tomorrow.

It’s not her fault. Nobody would choose to be that way. I lived with her the longest out of all her kids. I understand her better than anyone else. When she needed a place to stay and someone to take care of her, I volunteered. Nobody else wanted her. I have a finished basement. The perfect place for her to have her privacy. A perfect place for her mirrors and her scales. She’s down there, now.

I’m in the kitchen. It smells like roasting meat. I’m making mashed potatoes, too, and pie, for after. I love to cook for mom. I feel like it really helps her get better.

I’m loading up her plate: meat, potatoes, bread, and vegetables. I pile on huge portions. “Are you really going to eat that?” I whisper to myself and I smile.

Mom used to say that all the time.

“All that?” She’d whisper, with a pained look.

Nobody else heard.

A piece of chicken. Some broccoli. Mac and cheese. I used to feel ashamed. I would push it around to the edges of my plate. I ate little and slowly. Very slowly. 

She would pick artfully at a pile of lettuce. She winked at me as she hid meat and bread in her pockets. Always the jacket at dinner time. Nobody else saw.

When we were alone, she chewed up sweets and spit them into a trashcan between her legs.

“You try,” she’d say.

Bones. She liked to see them. Rib bones. Wrist bones. Hip bones. Knee bones. Ankle bones. All the condyles. All the bones. So long as they weren’t on my plate, a testimony to gluttony. 

Oh, but I was hungry. I was hungry and weak and my hair fell out.

I finally went to live with dad.

I could have chicken and broccoli and mac  and cheese.

I could have bones on my plate.

There was no scale in the bathroom, and I was glad. Glad to be rid of a different kind of weight.

But that was a long time ago.

Now, I’m heading down the stairs with Mom’s plate.

“I see you broke your mirror, again, mom.” I say. She managed to stretch out far enough to kick it over. “That’s okay, I’ll get you another one. We can use this one for now.” I reposition another mirror (Mom has so many!) so that she can watch me feed her.

I remove her gag. “Untie me, *please*.” she says. I smile and roll my eyes. She *always* says that.

Tears are rolling down her cheeks, but she sits up compliantly when I ask her to. Her skin folds around her back and belly, her thighs dimple and squelch together. She’s really filling out.

“Are you really going to eat that?” I whisper, waving a forkful in front of her face. “All that?”

“Please,” she cries. “Don’t.”

“Oh, yes you are.” I smile. “Swallow or choke, mom. Swallow or choke.”

Some creatures were outside the door to my room.

I got out of bed without making a sound, not knowing for sure yet if I had been found.

I gathered my clothes and got dressed in a minute, and picked up my backpack and threw my stuff in it.

I got to my dresser and tried not to freak, as opening the drawer made a terrible squeak.

With the growling outside growing louder than hell, I grabbed my old gun and a handful of shells.

As I opened the window and threw out my pack, they ran at the door which then started to crack.

The first thing I did when I got to the ground, was grab all my shit as the door busted down.

I ran to my truck by the light of the moon, but my footsteps were heard by the things in my room.

As they crawled out my window and right down the wall, I got to my truck, but it started to stall.

I then made a decision and ran for the trees, where I hid with my gun and I tried not to freeze. 

They all sniffed at the ground when they got to my truck, when they turned to the treeline, I thought I was fucked.

They got closer than ever, then turned and were gone, and I took a big breath as the creatures moved on.

I made it to daylight, the coast was all clear. But my demons will come like they do every year."

Facing the entrance, a stairway, voluminous, wary, described a dreary curve through the far outer wall, its boards even darker than the balustrade. I was standing up there one night, when the heavy doors had just been violently blasted inwards by the coldest gust, sweeping the floor of its dust. Bare-footed, my skin, only covered with a long white shawl, reflected the soft glimmer of the moonlight like a warm kiss from its mistress.

I proceeded on the little pathway meticulously drawn in the snow, towards the calling of the woods. Once at the brink, standing on the threshold of a single massive oak tree, decrepited and gleary, like if it were, by itself, the doorway to the forest, I shuddered under it’s imposing facade and felt it dissipate up to its last glow the natural light of the moon. It was too dark to naviguate, but I could distinctively hear the roar of the forest, the heart growling at its core, reverberating its own sorrow and mischief, a beating heart in yet a cold jungle. There was something else: as I lept forward in a neverending trail of thorns, wounds and darkness, there I saw it, faint, but as bright as can be; a very shy tint of red, barely sparkling through the thick black air surrounding it. As I started running, a glimpse of this warm feeling boiled through my whole body. Euphoria. Every inch of me was bleeding, but it felt good. There I finally was, and the words shriveled under my tongue, glided through the smallest corners of my mouth not to be heard. I was in awe before the most beautiful sight. Bloody red blossoms, at least the size of a hand, slithered around the most humongus of trees, right in the center of all this wide, dark land. I stood there watching for what felt like an hour.

My blood froze cold. In my about-turn, I couldn’t distinguish the face that retreated behind the tree not five meters away. It grinned at me before swiftly hiding. It wasn’t a soothing smile; it was a lifeless gesture, a transfiguration. I waited, montionless. And waited. And I ran, back on my tracks. Out of breath, I finally reached my house, bolted in, locked the heavy doors, climbed to bed and fell right into the claws of a deep slumber.

When I woke up, the sun hadn’t risen. I had a feeling of uneasiness hovering for a while now. Once my eyes adjusted to the dim glare of my quarters, I noticed a familiar haze at the feet of my bed. I slowly leaned forward, expecting a jewel, but in its place discovered, mortified, a blossom of the forest. My head got heavy, I felt myself fainting back into my sleep; while I was falling, I saw him, standing behind the curtains, smiling. "

I had been wanting it since I was six. My sister Addison’s had been a doll. It was not creepy looking. It looked like a normal doll a girl would play with. It had blonde hair and blue eyes. It was a look- alike doll and looked just like Addie, save for her eyes,because Addie’s eyes were brown. I had one when I was younger. Nothing bad happened with mine. 
I called my doll “Emily”. I know, I named it after myself. How original. It looked just like me though. Addie called her doll Susie. I thought that was kind of strange, but shrugged it off. When Addie started talking to her doll, I didn’t think much of it. Eight year olds play with dolls all the time. 
But one day I heard Susie speaking back.
Me and my boyfriend were getting ready to go to a concert, and I went to get my bag. As we were passing Addie’s room, I heard Addie talking to Susie- and Susie talking back. I thought I was losing my mind. It was only when Carter asked if I saw it too, that I realized what I was seeing was real. 
And then I realized something.
A few days ago, a little girl was killed. She had blonde hair and blue eyes. She had a look-alike doll. 
And her name was Susie. 
Overwhelmed, I went to bed. I was terrified, but somehow managed to sleep. Carter went to the library to do more research. I was sleeping restlessly-and woke to hands on my throat. 
My little sister was about to kill me. Addie- no Susie had me. My parents were not home. I was doomed. 
Somehow, I got a burst of strength. I pushed Addie off me. Her eyes were blue, and I realized that she was possessed. I grabbed the doll, ran to the fireplace- and threw it in. 
Addie’s eyes turned back to brown. She looked at me and started to cry. “Why did you throw my doll in the fire Emily?” It was then I realized she didn’t remember anything, and it was then my parents came home.
I was grounded for a solid month. 
I just got ungrounded today. Getting grounded sucked, but at least I am not dead.  I threw my old look- alike doll in the fire too.Nothing happened with mine, but I wasn’t taking any chances.

But I know. This isn’t Santa, or elves, or reindeer, or any other dumb childish tale my parents still expect me to believe. This is something far hungrier.

I could hear it up there, breathing heavily and waiting. Waiting for what, I didn’t know, until food began to go missing. Little things, at first (the candycanes my sister hung on the Christmas tree, the chocolates Dad bought for Mom on a whim), but its hunger only seemed to grow. I tried to tell them about the creature, and they would laugh. Of course, I had eaten the chocolates, and this was a way to shift the blame.

Until the eggs my mom had just bought disappeared. No one noticed the rotten smell creeping from the chimney. I frantically showed them, told them, tried to convince them, but they wouldn’t listen. This time, though, there were looks of concern. Whispered conversations behind my back that they thought I couldn’t hear. They thought *I* had done it, that I was feeding into my childish nightmares about the chimney. It no longer bothered me. I knew. There is something in the chimney.

I’ve started leaving food out for “Santa”. Every morning it’s gone. I know my parents aren’t taking it, because they think it’s me who’s doing it. They think I’ve gone crazy, but I don’t care anymore. I have worse to worry about.

The Thing has gotten bold. At night, the shaft creaks open. I hear it twist its body out of the newly opened chimney. Then I hear the creaking of the floorboards (the footsteps far too large to belong to any human or jolly old man), and the opening of the fridge. I don’t know what will happen when the food runs out. I will not let the food run out.

I’m leaving this note under my pillow. Just in case.

Please, if you’re reading this, don’t forget; there is something inside the chimney, and even though you may be reading this because something bad has happened, it is still there. Leave the house, and close the door behind you. 

And don’t forget to leave cookies out for Santa."

Nothing was stirring because nothing could be roused.

The family was flung by the chimney, seldom a care,

For Saint Nick was angry; he had blood in his hair!

&#x200B;

The children were first, ropes snug round each head

Flung from the banister, the sugar plums were dead.

Next came the grownups, caught up in “winter’s embrace”,

The man didn’t see Santa, yet Santa’s boot still met his face.  
 

The woman in her kerchief was far quicker; she was as fast as a freeze

She had caught Santa gloating and had brought him to his knees.

Since Mama had been rudely interrupted, pleasuring her mate,

She was reminded of the ball sack and knew its precarious state.

&#x200B;

Santa lay there gasping, struggling to breathe after she got her kicks in.

Forget Dasher and Dancer, this Prancer had made him a Vixen!

Besides all of that, though, there was something that was worse…

The man, fresh from uncoupling, had recovered and stood with a curse.

&#x200B;

Thankfully the lover was a coward, departing with barely a word,

Because Santa was tired of fighting; his points were never heard.

He grabbed at his wife and begged for her to just listen,

But surely enough only teardrops and icicles would glisten.

&#x200B;

He regretted killing his kids, but Missus Claus didn’t mind;

That’d been her plan all along, his fate was now signed!

Unfortunately for Mama, however, the plan hit a kink.

Her protection was her lover and he turned into a fink.

&#x200B;

So yeah, Santa was angry, but he was also upset, and not bloody

So he hit that cheating whore until the whole room turned ruddy.

Santa would laugh about this one day, though, and surely remember

That if he remarries, he could repeat this act every December!

&#x200B;

So with a “Ho! Ho! Ho!” the husband quickly fled from the scene.

He moved to Austin, now owns a Toyota, and calls himself Dean. 

“Christmas has almost arrived,” his new wife says with great cheer.

“I wonder if it’ll still be as special as this one, come next year?”"
a8bgjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a8bgjc/i_cant_die/,I can’t die,9,3,1545408724.0,"So this all began when I was around 14 I’ve always been a normal kid had normal grades but that doesn’t  really need to be explained. The first time I figured out I can’t die was when I was riding to school with my mom. We were going down the highway when out of no where someone slammed into the passenger side. That’s when I heard him it wasn’t scary it was It was like I was at bliss and at total peace.That’s when bill showed up or that’s what he said his name was. He told me that he had other plans for me that’s when I woke up in the hospital with my family by me. The doctors explained to me when the ambulance and police arrived I had a piece of shrapnel sticking out of my chest. They said I shouldn’t have survived that it was medically impossible almost. I stayed in the hospital for a week but they said that I was completely fine the second day. Like the incident never happened. 
Skip forward 5 years and my second experience happened. 
It was a hunting accident I was in the woods with some friends when I felt something hit my body with a lot of force and I blacked out. That’s when I seen bill again he didn’t say much to me except he said that I’ll be fine. Then I woke up I felt absolutely ok but everyone around me was freaking out and a hunter was calling 911. They all looked at me in shock when I asked what’s wrong. Even though I said I was fine the ambulance still took me to a hospital I’d  gotten shot in the chest with a hunting rifle. There was no way I should have been alive I made sure nothing happened to the guy legally because I was fine. Skip another 7 years and this was my latest experience.  Ironically enough it was a car crash like my first but this time I wasn’t in a car but on a motorcycle. Almost as same as the first guy cuts me off I go flying and black out. I see bill and I ask him why I keep coming back. What he told me made me wish I would die. In a stern voice he says “I just want to see every way a creature can die that’s when I woke up completely fine."

I am writing this because I am in a dire situation and I would greatly appreciate all the help I can get.
Let’s start at the beginning. 

Last weekend, on Saturday, I went to the beach with my children and hubby.
We spent the whole day having fun spending time together. It was great.
But as soon as I opened the front door to our house in the evening, I started to feel a scratching sound in my left ear. It was so quiet that I’m not even sure if I even heard it at that point, but I’ve come to the conclusion that I did. Because it got worse. It got louder, more vigorous.

When I woke up the next day, I started to feel it in my right ear too. It was already way more unsettling than the evening before. Now fast forward to today, and I can’t sleep. It’s keeping me awake.
All the time.
I haven’t slept the last two nights.
I haven’t been able to concentrate because of this fucking scratching sound. It’s gotten so loud that I’m sure that it will drive me insane in less than a few days. 
I’ve also felt a strong urge to return to the beach. I know it’s 4 AM right now on a stormy Wednesday night, but I think I’ll go right now.

I'll admit that most would consider it unusual to spend your Friday nights bent over a desk at the university library with only a small lamp for company, especially instead of taking up that invite from your friends to go on a night out. What can I say: I guess I just occasionally prefer the feeling of sore-eyed satisfaction you get from finishing a good novel to... well, binge drinking in the evening and a hangover in the morning. Sue me then!

There's just something about books. They are like this *living* thing. Whether it be romance or horror, from the first page of a book, a story will grab a hold of you and not let go.

I say hello to the librarian on her way out. She's a friendly enough woman and stops to chat a moment. She says lastly that she has to lock up the building, but that I will be able to let myself out.

With most of the lights off, without the sound of students, without the librarian at hand, the library looks and feels eerie. I'm used to it though. I start perusing the shelves, hoping something of interest will jump out. My fingers flick past Heinlein and Herbert, working their way down the alphabet.

A noise closeby startles me. It lasted only a second. It was very faint - it sounded like a muffled growl.

But as I listen, I catch the sound of wheezing air, like someone breathing down your neck. I crouch down in a squatting position: on the bottom shelf is a single book, leathery brown and creased. There is something off about it. I can still hear that sound, of a lone rodent or whatever it may be.

I reach out to get the book, but accidentally knock it over. It's gone and fallen behind the shelf and I have to really crouch down low and blindly thrust my hand in between the panes to reach it.

My hand finally finds it, and I immediately feel the edges of *several jagged teeth*."

‘Ho ho ho! And what’s your name, young lady?’. ‘Lucy’, she chirps. I can see the excitement dancing in her green eyes. 

‘What do you want for Christmas?’, I try to make my voice as deep and pleasant as possible. She cups her hand around her mouth and whispers, ‘A pony. But don’t tell my mom, I want it to be a surprise for her.’ I chuckle at her innocence. 

‘Sure, my child. Where’s your house?’, I whisper back. ‘102, Lumberton Street. You know, the house by the big tree on the corner. But don’t send it there, Santa. Send it to my cousin, Jack’s, place. It’s in England. I’ll be there, ok?’, she says with dead seriousness.

When I decided to spend my Saturday afternoon in a cramped warehouse, inspecting goodie-filled shoeboxes with a dozen other university volunteers, I thought my biggest dilemma would be deciding whether to throw Mutant Ninja Turtles toys in the “discard” pile.

*No choking hazards, no spillable liquids, no books that promote fighting.* The Operation Christmas Kid packing guidelines should have been simple enough to follow for first-world churchgoers mailing religion to impoverished kids in the Philippines. 

Yet, inside the package before me, is an arsenal of full-blown *weapons*. 

Instead of toys, clothes or stationary, there’s artillery ranging from knives to tasers to hacksaws—even a manual for the disposal of bodies. And, like the other shoeboxes, included is a handwritten note from the sender.

*“Dear child,*

*Wishing you a Merry Christmas, filled with God’s love.*

*I once had a daughter your age, who I spoiled with beautiful things. They did not keep her safe. They did not protect her.*

*In your life, you will encounter people who claim to be God’s workers—people with power. Not all of these people are good. Not all seek to help you.*

*Here is my gift to you—the tools and instructions for protection. I pray that you never need to use them.*

*Psalm 82:4*

*Blessings”*

I’m completely dumbfounded. What kind of whackadoo would give weapons to a *child*? Self-conscious of the boxed armory sitting there on the inspection table, I quickly replace the lid while I think of who to report this mess to.

“Krista, need a hand?” queries the warm voice of my middle-aged volunteer supervisor, Jerry. Thank goodness, I think with relief. He’ll know what to do. 

“Sir, this is crazy. You’re not gonna believe what someone packed i-“

Suddenly, I go dead silent. I can feel his hand caressing my thigh under the table, in the middle of a room of people. My instincts scream for me to push him away. Too uncomfortable to react, I merely wait for the awful moment to pass. Eventually, Jerry shifts his attention away from my leg.

“You’ve been inspecting that box for a while, sugar. Anything in there I should know about?”

The disgusted expression on my face segues to resolve.

…

“No” I answer firmly, sealing the shoebox tight with duct tape.

“This box is all ready to ship.”"

This was somewhat odd, as the tower did have generators.

Outside, where the power was uninterrupted, life went on. People shopped and walked and talked and laughed. Life went on.

Thirty minutes past the power going out, all communications from within the highrise were severed. All Internet connections shut down at exact same moment, as did all phone lines and cellular signals. Ms. Norma Jennings, sixty-four years old and now mother of three rather than four, later related between choking sobs that her daughter seemed happy and safe in her home when the Skype feed on both their cell phones cut out.

Outside, nobody noticed anything was amiss.

An hour and a half past the power going out, peculiar sounds could be heard from inside the building. Crazed and inhuman shrieking, as if things halfway between human and animal was fighting for their lives. People peered in close to the building's front door, debated calling the police, but in the end decided not to. After all, best to just mind one's own business.

The shrieking continued for another forty minutes, then suddenly ceased.

Three and a half hours past the power going out, residents of a neighbouring tower reported observing strange things in the powerless tower from their balconies. Glimpses of naked human - or possibly, *humanoid* - figures dancing and fornicating frantically in the midst of odd, sourceless light, ever flickering. Odd shapes of shadow dancing on the walls of the apartment units, as bloody beings danced and fucked as if their lives were over.

Six hours later, the highrise burned down. There were no survivors.

What happened next was, to the general public, odd. Within hours of the fire dying out, the government was on the scene. The site was sealed off, and everything seen and recovered was classified at the highest levels.

What was in those files would never see the light of day, the file cabinet containing them mysteriously going up in flames decades later, two days before the files were to be unsealed.

It was what was found in the ruins, where the bodies should have been. There *were* bodies, but not of the residents - at least the agents on the scene told themselves. They *couldn't* have been the residents, they told themselves.

The charred remains found - twisted, broken, black as night - weren't human. They could *never* have been human, everyone who saw them swore. And, in some, though the bodies were dead and smoking black, the hearts still beat wet and fast.

The site was demolitioned, and a business tower built over it. All was fine, and two years later, the first Supervisory Agent on the scene locked himself in his garage and shot himself."

The fear of being HEARD by other people in the bathroom. You know, followed by the awful suspenseful silence when you sprint from the car to the gas station bathroom, which has stalls for some reason, frantically searching for a stall without the assorted delights of bloody tampons, used diapers, diarrhea, or the rare half eaten piece of food floating in the toilet. 

I was lucky. I don't really stop at those bathrooms. This was maybe the third time- and definitely the last. 
After three diet Coke's, a burrito bowl, and a family sized package of raisins, I had to *go*. Launched myself out of the car and into a shitty stall. 

A woman was crying. Something about a baby, a divorce, a miscarriage, a breakup. I tapped on the profanity covered plastic, trying to be nice.

""You good?""

No response. Just quiet crying.

""Are you, um. Okay?""

Nothing. But it was the wrong kind of nothing. The sound of breath was gone, ragged or otherwise. Instead, there was an awful, empty silence. 

Suddenly, a pale, delicate hand appeared over the top of the side wall separating the stalls. I was confused. I stared. I stared too long, and then the hand shot down towards me, impossibly fast, the arm impossibly long, lovecraftian and snakelike. On the hand, a bloodless crevice opened, revealing an eye that could not, should not exist, pale yellow and without a pupil. 

The hand grabbed my ankle, and with a snap that shouldn't have biologically been possible, shattered my ankle. The pain didn't sink in until I realized I was screaming.

I slammed my body against the toilet, heard the plasticine ceramic imitation groan under the weight, and struck my broken ankle against the flush handle. The water pressure rushed against the bowl,  I felt the impending buzzing of something under me, and then I was scrambling, hurrying, climbing out of the stall as quickly as I could, skidding across the shit covered tile, and dashing into my car as the bathroom screamed with water pressure, and saw the flood in my rearview mirror.

My parents are worried about me, but I promised them I'll be there soon. I'm a little concerned though. I looked at the ankle wound I have and it looks normal. Except for the eye without a pupil staring out of me from the darkness."

Because of this I learned how to pretend to sleep.  They'd come in, flick the light on, and see their son lying in bed, asleep.  They'd close the light, I'd wait a bit, then open my eyes to see that they had gone to bed.  

That was until my 14th birthday.  They were still strict about my curfew.  They'd come in, flick the light on, and find their son passed out after all that daily puberty.  The lights would flick off, I'd wait a bit, and then... I opened my eyes.  The dark sillhouette of my mother was standing in the doorway, back illuminated by the hallway light; her front and face, a pitch black.  

""You should be sleeping, little one.""  

I apologized.  

It wasn't long after that I developed the skill to appear asleep but have partial vision.  If you were to look at me, you'd think my eyes were closed, but they're just open enough that I could see only a slight blur, but plenty detailed to practically see.  

One night I tested it.  

Mother entered the room, flicked on the light, saw I was ""sleeping"", flicked the light off, then stood there.  From my seemingly closed eyes, I could see her sillhouette standing there, the darkness consuming any distinguishing feature.  Soon she left and I could hop back on my phone.  

I carried the habit through to my adulthood.  One night, I lied awake next to my wife, unable to sleep, while she happily snored away.  As I lied there a few hours, I finally noticed that my wife stopped snoring.  I peeked like I usually did and I found her just lying there, staring at me with big, wide, unblinking eyes.  

""You should be sleeping, little one.""  

She whispered in a low rasp.  My mother had died a few years ago.  I don't open my eyes when I try to sleep now.  "

They take place every year on 22nd December, for one day only. And woe betide you if you draw the short straw and have to be working that day, you just lose your chance at the bargains till next year unless you're one of the lucky ones that can ask a family member to go in your place.

Always crowds of people at the mall that day, pushing, shoving, hurrying from store to store, scared that someone else will pick up the prize goods before them.And they'll grab stuff out of your hands, it can get really vicious, I''ve seen so many fights.I saw that first, no its mine, and then punches start flying.The experienced bargain hunters go in groups to guard against this sort of thing happening.

Many people take out bank loans specifically for the sales, they couldn't afford the prices otherwise.I always do, you can't let an opportunity just pass you by.

But the reductions are worth it.I still remember one year I got a loaf of bread, only a week old, reduced by 60% to only $478. It was ok soaked in water to take the hardness off where it had gone stale. And on top of that, I got the last piece of cheese, and that was only $700, I think it had been reduced by 80%, I couldn't believe my luck.It was absolutely fine once I cut the mould off.We ate Christmas dinner like kings that year.

I wonder if there'll be any great bargains like that this year? Its been years since we had a really tasty Christmas dinner.

She decorated the table, put out crackers and left a Santa hat on everyone’s plate. 

It was the first Christmas since the divorce. She wanted her kids to remember it for good reasons, not just for the stuff they would associate it with when they looked back later and understood things more.

At five and eight years old, Tilly and Oliver were at the prime age for Christmas enjoyment – but they were very picky eaters. That’s why Danielle was so thrilled when they gobbled down her “special Christmas meat” without any coaxing. In years past they had pushed their turkey around their plates as if it was poisoned, so she was relieved this dish was going down a treat.

“Do we have to go all the way to Daddy’s tomorrow?” asked Tilly out of the blue.

“Oh no! I hope Jill isn’t round. I don’t like her, or her screaming little brat of a baby,” Oliver moaned.

“No. You’re not going there.” Danielle replied, a little more harshly than she meant to. Her children turned to her, surprised. She cleared her throat and smiled, calming her tone. 

“In fact,” she continued, jabbing her fork into a particularly juicy lump of the special Christmas meat, “you never have to go again. I don’t think you’ll be seeing much of Daddy and his new friend from now on.”

She bit into the fleshy meat and swallowed, savouring the flavour. It’s true what people said – human meat did taste a bit like chicken. She wondered briefly who would watch the kids when she drove to the pit to dispose of the bones. Oh well; that was tomorrow’s problem.

“Eat up, kids,” Danielle said in a sing-song tone. “There’s dessert yet to come. You’ll love it.”"

I had received it as a gift from my grandma. It was a foot long wooden figure of an old man, wearing a funny hat. It was possible to bend and twist its limbs although it wasn't mechanized. It served as my favourite patient when I played doctor. 

""Nurse, we're losing him!"", I whispered to my Spiderman action figure. I had wrapped a cloth around him to make it seem like he was wearing nurse clothes. 

I recalled the time my grandma gave this doll to me as I saw him on my operating table. 
""His name is Ricky. You must not forget his name. If you do, he will get angry and will not respond."" The thought of the doll with the funny hat getting angry amused me. 

""Hand me the stethoscope and the knife, nurse!"" I whispered urgently to spiderman, who was clearly not doing a very good job. I made a mental note to punish him for that. I adjusted the stethoscope and slid it around the man's waist, whispering absurd instructions at a fast pace to spiderman who was struggling to keep up with me. 

My heart skipped a beat as I heard something. I pinched myself and readjusted my stethoscope, my own heart thumping against my chest now. That was a heartbeat. That had to have been. A chill ran down my spine. 

""Mom..?"" I must be checking it wrong. I'll just ask mom to check it. I chucked the stethoscope aside and hurriedly ran to open the door. But just as I was going to turn the handle, a sticky web shot bolted the door shut. I looked back and saw all my patients and staff, ready to play doctor. But with me as a patient.

It was the kind of day that had the him and his brother, Duke, sitting in their yard, sweat sticking their shirts to their chests, absentmindedly picking grass from the lawn and tossing around ideas for escaping the perpetual heat. They had been arguing, though the memory of the argument had long since faded from Duke’s mind, when they suddenly heard a rustling from the treeline, the crunch of tall weeds underfoot. The man who appeared to them from within the woods was tall, his arms outstretched, his scraggly bearded mouth curled back into a sharp grin. He was filthy, his tall, naked form smothered head to toe in filth and grime, eyes rolled back in his head, staring at the heavens as he stood. Five mouths, blithering and screaming, grew from his hands, feet, and the right side of his lower body. Seeing him, images of the crucifixion bubbled to the top of Duke’s mind. The boys were immediately overcome with a sense of peace, the heat dissipated into a thin, vaporous haze and then vanished altogether, replaced with a vague sense of warmth, more emotional than physical, wrapping itself around them like a blanket. The mouths didn’t stop screaming, from them flowed milk and honey and as they entered the boy’s flesh, dripping over their tongues and down their throats, digesting themselves and dissolving into their souls, they revealed wonders. The boys followed the man into the woods, out where the saints grew from the trees and spoke with the thunderous voice of heaven, all shouting in unison, mad, hideously mad and so very hungry. Duke watched as Donald opened his arms to the sky, ascending higher and higher, the saints in the trees reaching out to touch his skin as his fragile form glided up and up and up, until it was obscured by the violent shaking of the trees. Up to heaven, abandoning his body, leaving his meat to the saints. "

Analyzing how the mind of the criminal works is always fascinating. Like this criminal Johnny Sage, for example. He was a ""renowned"" mysterious rapist that usually stalks his prey at New York's central park at night. People believe that he has already raped more than thirty women. The police have already heard about the rumor of incidents like this multiple times, but never able to catch the guy because he never left any trace. Even his victim disappears completely. But a week ago, one victim apparently escaped from an abandoned warehouse where he put the victims he kidnapped, and blow everything to the police. He was then pursued and arrested when he tried to run away just outside the city.

Or the story of Brian Kennedy, a serial killer who likes to give a puzzling tip to the police about his next victim. It was then become a race with the time for the police to prevent the killing before it happened, but they always arrived a little too late to the scene, with the still warm body already chopped into pieces. And sometimes he didn't even leave any body parts to find. Only stains of blood on the floor and walls, where the forensics did DNA test and confirm that it was indeed the blood of the disappeared victims. It was because he forgot to destroy his last victim's phone that the police could track the phone's whereabouts, and found him, still bathed in his victim's blood, with a giant meat cleaver on his hand, and he got arrested earlier this week.

But if there's one similarity between those two cases, the police found that they frequently visit Frank Webb, a local barber in New York downtown, who was also just got arrested for quietly serving human meats to closeted cannibals population in New York. So that's probably where those two sent – or probably sold – their victims' corpse, and wiped out the trace of their crimes. Blew my mind. I've been his customer for years. I had no idea he was a barber."

We were a loving family. I had a perfect husband – a hard working, caring, vivacious man who was also a perfect father to our beautiful twins. I remember the days when he had to woo me, he used to make me feel so loved and protected! Unfortunately he was killed in a hit and run case more than a year ago.

I had felt like my heart had been ripped out of me. I was inconsolable for a week. I tried to gather my wits for the sake of my daughters. They were just 4 years old, too young to understand the gravity of the situation. All they knew was that their father had gone on a vacation and they wouldn’t be seeing him anytime soon. 

The support shown by my family and friends was immense. I couldn’t have pulled it through without them. It had been nearly five years since I had quit my job and stayed at home to look after the kids. They helped me get back on my feet, find a job, they even took turns babysitting. I’m thankful to be in the kind of neighbourhood that I am in. And on most days, their love and support is enough to get me through. On most days...

Around 4 months ago, my little Riya started falling ill. It started with mild diarrhea which later became serious and was combined with vomiting. It was intermittent before, leading us to think that water may have been the culprit. When it persisted and became severe in spite of taking all precautions, my parents suggested taking them to the doctor. My finances weren’t so great, so all I could afford at that time was a trip to the public clinic where there’s a doctor for every 500 patients and no specialists. The bored doctor just glanced at her before prescribing some medicines. 

Sympathy started pouring in from all sides, some least expected. My neighbours started pooling in and preparing meals for my kids. My parents offered to look after them, but the mother in me couldn’t let them go away. My friends started dropping by more often. It cheered me up for a while. 

I have prepared my daughters’ favourite dishes for Christmas dinner today. I want them to feel as loved as I feel now, with everyone’s support. They are the reason for the amount of attention I’m getting these days. Now, as I take out the arsenic from the corner of the cabinet under the sink, I’m in a dilemma. Do you think I will get more love if a tragedy struck today or if the illness was stretched out long?"

Of the cabin. It looked like a cabin painted by Bob Ross. So beautiful up here on the High Knob! It on the inside was a bit different. It was weird like the inside aged way faster than the outside.

The first day took a lot of elbow grease cleaning the nasty inside up. But we did it and that day was uneventful. The next night we were roasting marshmallows on an open fire. The moon seems to dance behind the clouds. As it did Dana caught a glimpse of something and jumped up and ran toward the cabin.

""What happened""?!  I said as I ran in behind her.
""I saw her or it,"" she said shaking! One thing I knew was Dana don't lie! Amanda approached and said ""what happened"" As I held Dana hugging 
Her while she cried I look toward Amanda. As I did my eyes dropped down immediately to her legs!
My mind and eyes couldn't comprehend what they saw! They're looking right at me from between Amanda's legs was a face! 

The face of a granny! It sounds funny but this things mouth stretched from ear to ear with razor sharp yellow teeth.  And when it stood straight up it towered over Amanda by 3 feet! I had no time to warn her bc In one quick bite Amanda's head was 
Gone! If you ever watched The Evil Dead 2 you'll get an idea but it was no movie.

We ran upstairs bc the door was blocked by this thing. Quietly went to a bedroom locked the door and his in the closet. We sat in there Dana was in shock. We could hear it devouring our friend. Could hear bones crunching. 

 ""Will it go"" Dana whispered. ""Yes after it eats"" I assured her. But I was disappointed when I heard heavy footsteps start ascending the stairs.  And the door BUST open! And heavy steps coming toward the closet. I literally pissed myself.

This monstrosity busted through the closet door
And it did its worst clawing ripping eating!  You may be asking how I'm writing this?

 Well, I used Dana as a shield and as it scratched at me and seen her eyes and nose fly off! Finally got out of that room and I'm in my car writing this going fifty miles per hour.

This thing is twenty feet behind the car gaining fast and I'm feeling my conscience subdue me into pulling over to get my cowardly selfish self dealt with. The only thing worse than hindsight is foresight and I'll soon be ripped apart!

We got bored and wandered away to one of the back allies to hang out. A few of my friends were passing around a joint. I declined.

“Pussy!” One of them said, “You never want to do anything wrong.”

“Why would I? It’s only going to get me in trouble or hurt someone.”

“You’d  hurt someone if you had too.”

“ I never would!”

“Are you sure?” A man in a mask stepped from the shadows, “Mask or mirror.”

“Look, Mister we were just leaving.”

The man came closer, “It’s a simple question.”
He pulled the mirror from his pocket. “ Mask or mirror? Do you want the truth or do you want to hide from it? YOU!”

He pointed at me and the others moved away. I froze.

“ Mask or Mirror?”

“ M-mirror?” I stuttered unable to look away.

“A bold choice. Not many people would choose the truth.”

“ What will I see?”

The man smiled a flawless grin bright under his black mask.

“You will see who you truly are and who you will be. Still willing?”

I nodded though I was trembling in every inch .

He brought out a hand mirror and held it before me. I approached and looked in.

There was a magnetic sensation  images floated before my eyes . Bombs destroyed buildings, guns fired into crowds. Families were separated by soldiers and world leaders were assassinated. The sky grew dark with smoke and ash . A terrible laughter rang in my ears.

Then the scene changed to a red carpeted room full of lavish decorations. A man in a uniform spoke to me. “The World awaits your address, My Master.”

I was confused then. I looked out the window at the ashen sky.  I realized I was seeing through the eyes of the villain who was responsible for this destruction. I stepped toward the desk the camera is pointing at.

“Speak to the camera, my Master.”

I turned to the monitor to see the face of the monster who caused so much destruction.

The face I saw was my own.

I screamed and then I was falling. I awoke trembling on the street with my hands over my eyes. The man was gone.

I was changed after that night. After the third suicide attempt they put me here. I don’t talk any more and I make sure I am always in solitary. It’s what’s best for everyone.

We never had many rules, as my mother wasn't that strict, but she did enforce this one. She used to say it to me daily before we left to go wherever we were headed that day. Tossing her purse over her shoulder, she would recount that all too familiar phrase with her warm sing-song voice, “Remember to check the doors before we leave! We wouldn’t want any to stay open!”

She always said it in an offhand way, so I was never too concerned about it. But still, she was my mother-the only parent I had-and I had gotten so used to the ritual at that point that it was second nature, a silly box to check off on our morning routine. She never explained why, either, but I had just thought it was a nitpick of hers. Or maybe it was to keep my cat, Tulip, out of our things while we were away. Anyways, I had never really cared.

Until my first day of highschool. I was already feeling the pressure, and to top it off, we were running late on my first day. Mom was already in the car when I realized it was raining. I ran back to our coat closet and frantically yanked the nearest rain jacket off the hanger. I swung the door seemingly closed, reached down to pet Tulip goodbye, and sprinted out of the house.

If it’s worth anything, I had a good day at school. Mom picked me up, and we talked ecstatically about school, and classes, and, “did I see any boys I thought were cute?”. Then we pulled into our driveway.

The front door was wide open. Windows, too. My mom stared at the house, her face contorted into an expression of true terror, and something inside of me froze; I had never seen my mom scared before. A stench of rot wafted from the open crevice, but still we, as if in a dream, got out of the car and moved towards it. We entered slowly. My feet had barely met the hardwoods when my mom jerked me back and threw her hands over my eyes. 

It was too late. I had already seen. It was Tulip. Not Tulip, anymore, but what had been her. Her insides were strung out on our mantle like Christmas lights, and blood streamed down our fireplace like red, twisting ribbons. I gagged. I was suddenly struck by the way the closet door hadn’t clicked when I closed it this morning. I began to sob into my mother’s arms. Later she would find what was left of poor Tulip staining our winter coats the same red of her now shredded collar. We immediately moved.

My mom no longer reminds me of it, but I know now. We have a rule in our house. Never leave a door open, or you might unwillingly invite the uninvited."

Ever since I had moved in she had greeted me and introduced me to her strange ass obsession with Rapunzel.

I'm not kidding, that's all this woman talked about, fascinated at the idea of a long-haired girl trapped in a building and how to recreate it.  She also talked about her ""miscarriage,"" or at least that's how I took it, since she would always say her little girl was now her only company but I never saw a child anywhere.

When she was still in this God-accursed place I remembered her talking to herself, trying to convince herself the Rapunzel thing was possible.  Of course, though these paper thin walls, one can hear anything, so I tried my best to ignore her ramblings.

She was a lonely woman too. From what I've heard she hadn't married and hadn't had any more kids. Her only company was a cat, or at least I think that's what it was.

It would explain the scratches on her arms and the mewling noises coming from beyond her door. But it wouldn't explain the knocking on the walls beside me.

But it would impress you what humans can grow accustomed to since eventually I just ignored it, the knocking, the talking, everything.

I reached my limit last month when I heard crying beyond the walls. It was soft at first but as it grew louder it sounded like a young girl bawling her eyes out.

I obviously called security, but they didn't find or hear anything. My neighbor came back and was indignant about me telling security on her while she was out and she blamed me of invading her privacy.

The next day I saw her crying in the lobby and asked her what happened.

She said that while she was out her ""companion"" had died, her hair not long enough to protect her from the cold while she was out of the building. I asked her why she hadn't left the heat on but she just dismissed me saying it wouldn't have been necessary had she had long hair.

I lost all respect for her then, if you're gonna have pets at least take good fucking care of them, the poor kitty.

That was the also the last I saw of her.

Last Tuesday some new tenants came in and discovered a fake wall, knocking it down on accident when the wife was cleaning and dropped the vacuum on it.

I saw it all from outside my door as the paramedics loaded an emaciated figure on the stretcher, one pale blue hand dangling from it, its nails wore down to the fingers.

I couldn't help but notice that she looked so much like my neighbor, or her long hair trailing behind her.

I'm not so sure about the miscarriage now. "
a7pa1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a7pa1i/the_shed/,The Shed,113,12,1545245443.0,"There’s an old legend in the town where I live about a mysterious shed. 

In 1977 A guy named Scott Mills came home late one night and heard a howling outside. When he looked he saw an odd shed standing in his backyard that wasn’t there before. Bizarre glowing lights illuminated from inside with the door shut. Scott approached and opened the door and was bathed in light. Days later police found Scott wondering on the side of the road talking nonsense. He told them about the shed, and he told them he could hear voices. When the police went to his house to investigate no shed was ever found. There’s a lot of mystery as to what happened to Scott after that. Some of the older folks in town say he hung himself  days later after talking with the police. Some say he moved. Others say the whole story is made up and there never was a Scott Mills that lived here. 

But there’s another account that happened with the shed again in 1984. Apparently a group of five middle school kids was playing out in the woods one afternoon and they found the shed. It looked worn down and antique looking but had golden handles that appeared brand new. 

The kids were drawn to the shed. 

They each went in one at a time and after they came out, they were never the same. One boy, killed his whole family by sawing their heads off with a butter knife. When they found him- days after the initial murder, he was still sawing at the bone and talking to himself. The others had similar stories. One killed his family and his dog by hanging them from the neighborhood power lines. Another burned the house down in the middle of the night. The boys were all taken into custody, but their whereabouts are kept under wraps. Those five would be in their late thirties now. I’ve never met them. 

Like the Scott Mills guy, no one is really sure what happened to them after they were taken into custody. But I have a feeling I’m going to soon find out. 

Last night, my six year old daughter and I were playing hide and seek in the back yard. She hid for quite awhile, and finally came out after several minutes of hiding. I asked her where she hid, and she replied, “in the shed.” 

We don’t have a shed. 

She was talking funny and her speech was muddled. We rushed her to the pediatrician in fear of some kind of neurological issues. They said she was fine. But as I put her to bed, her eyes started to glaze over and she asked me where the matches were. She laughed. 

I can still hear her laughing through the walls."

Normally I would hear sounds of my mom cooking in the kitchen, or at least yelling at me for slamming the door. ""Mom?"" I called out. I peaked into the kitchen and no one was there. I walked into the living room and  jumped at the sight of my dad. I didn't expect him to be home, and has been standing there so quietly the whole entire time. I walked closer to him ""dad, where's mom?"" I could tell there were tears in his eyes. He reached out his left arm to hug me. ""I am sorry."" He said. ""What are you...""

a7j6c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a7j6c5/lifes_curse/,Life's Curse,15,1,1545194754.0,"Nothing is crueler than life.  Death is swift, death is kind.  Those who say that death is cruel, slow, or agonizing understand nothing―that is not death.  That is the consequence of life.

Life doesn't have to apply simply to people.  Everything is alive, to some extent―but only some things are able to make use of that life.  Animals, or plants, or the changing of seasons.  They live, they hurt, and eventually they pass.  There are those, however, who can never pass, and live in an eternal cycle of pain.  Stones and metals can never die―and they cannot do anything but feel their shapes be marred and distorted.

I can't die either.  I am neither stone nor metal, but I cannot die.  I once wished for immortality, in a naive and childlike hope―before I understood life and death.  A cruel angel granted my wish, and somehow I knew that it had been granted.  I lived a full life.  My pain began once my wife died―she had grown old, and death was kind to her.  My friends began to die as well, and I began to understand the true horror behind life.  I was not yet broken; I had children, and I watched them grow older.  

My life never faltered―my guardian angel made sure of that.  My body was not so lucky, and began to break down―the heart, the muscles, the joints.  I was bedridden, and my family (it had grown quite large in my lifetime) often came to visit me.  They were loving and supportive, but behind their eyes was the pity that was went hand-in-hand with the end of life.

I first learned the true nature of life once my body died.  My heart burst, my muscles failed.  My family cried over my dead body, and I had to watch their sorrow.  It hurt more than an entire lifetime of pain.  I was buried in a coffin of wood and metal.  My family came and went, some more often than others, always with downcast eyes and a shuffle in their step.  It was painful to see.

My consciousness was trapped inside my skull as my body rotted away.  The rot hurt less than the feeling of waiting, waiting, waiting for the next person to visit my grave.  But as time moved on, fewer people visited my grave―as the people who had known me began to dwindle.  That was more painful than any physical pain I could've ever experienced.  But what hurt most was watching every last one of my children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren be buried in the same graveyard―their bodies as lifeless as mine, leaving me more and more alone in the world.  

I wish I could die.  Any death is preferable to this hellish half-existence.  

But, then again, I asked for this."
a7iyke,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a7iyke/its_either_us_or_them/,It’s Either us or Them,18,7,1545192958.0,"As I lay injured, broken and battered beyond recognition, I contemplated on what could have been if it weren’t for them. My son lay dead at my feet, my wife weeping, trying to shelter my others children from behind closed doors with Invaders right at our doorstep. Surrounded from all sides, we swore to fight till the last drop of blood, because after all it was Either Us or Them.

They took us unexpectedly, they came with blowtorches one day and burnt everything down in the town next to us, before we could react all we knew was that they were already at our door. We were very unprepared. We numbered in thousands and sheer number is all we had. We literally had nothing else.

&#x200B;

They attacked us not with numbers, nor with tactics, but brute force itself. There was no chance we would last against them. They stomped down our houses, murdering thousands at once. Using weapons which were beyond recognition. This was not the first time they had waged war against us and I was pretty sure it wouldn’t be the last either. 

I was so sure of the fact that we must migrate before the invasion arrived that I went to the queen herself. But sadly, no one listened. We tried as hard as we could, trying to use our numbers against them, but their armour was to frigging thick. They destroyed, ravaged and murdered everything in their path; the queen was targeted first and systematically everyone else. We held them for days, but they were merciless and relentless. Age wasn’t an Issue for them nor was Class. They murdered all.

And as I lie in the dust, bleeding to death with a foot aimed straight at my face, I still remember my Father’s last words: “It’s either us or the Humans”."

Mine was a steampunk guy. My friends was a horse mask. We headed over around 5:30. We were there by 5:53. We got up to the door. I knocked and waited. Second bad choice.

Third bad decision. She took me up to the bathroom and got me a bandage. But, she stopped. Her fangs popped out.

##**RULES AND REGS**##


* Stories must be ""Holiday"" themed.

* Contest entries **must** be tagged with [The Holidays 2018]. No tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are as seen, with capitalization of the ""T"" in The and the ""H"" in Holidays, and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results. For example, during our /r/SleepSpell competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged exactly as the search I listed. So please, please, please, use the tag exactly as it is listed.

* All entries must adhere to the normal subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. One every 24 hours as our rule normally is.

* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate and may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions! 

* Top 5 Upvoted Stories are the winners. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winners circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winners circle due ties and multiple placements.


_________________________


**Top Winner Prizes:**

* $5 Amazon Digital Gift Card (Donated by yours truly and Commander-in-Creep, /u/Human_Gravy)

Oh Jolene, if you had only seen the stranger swap the shot glasses, you wouldn’t be in this predicament but you were too busy having a good time to notice. As the concoction started to take effect, you realized a little too late that you had been drugged.

Sweet Jolene, if you had just stayed sleeping, you wouldn’t have witnessed the horror of your body being held down. I'm sure your mind was racing, not knowing what was to become of you. 

Precious Jolene, if you had just understood, how great an honor it is to be chosen, maybe you wouldn’t have looked so terrified as the ceremonial knife was plunged into your ivory chest. You were the final step in the ritual, you were the perfect sacrifice.

a7hcuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a7hcuq/possession_on_55/,Possession on 55,390,12,1545181065.0,"The day my girlfriend broke up with me,  I cried so much my eyes turned stoner red.  The cop that pulled me over for doing 120 in a sixty said that I must be smoked out of my mind.  

I said, “This is what a broken heart looks like.” 

He put me in the back for possession.  When I asked why, the verdict was possessiveness over the girl.  He cuffed me and slammed my head against the door interior. 

What I next remembered was reading the signed copy of a police report.  A police report I don’t remember writing. 

It went like this: 

I loved my girlfriend more than the world. 

She was the joy of my day, the smile behind the counter when I came home, the kiss whenever I needed love.  There are few things I wouldn’t have done for Claire. 

Claire with her bouncy brown hair and beautiful smile.  Claire that would sing as she went about her day and who told the silliest jokes. 

I killed Claire because I had no choice.  She was interested in another man and I couldn’t convince her otherwise.  It was the only choice for both of us.  

I admit that I did it, her body was in the trunk busted up by a crowbar —did it at 3:04am on the 55. 

Once finished reading, I wiped a tear from my eye.  It took everything not to break down right then. 

“You’re going to jail for a very long time,” the policeman said. 

I nodded.  That fact was clear from the beginning. 

“There’s something wrong with your report, though.” 

I looked up. 

“Body wasn’t in the trunk.  We’ve had reports of a bloody girl with a crowbar walking down the 55.  Ain’t nobody found her yet.” 

I flexed my hands to quell the shaking.  “She’s alive?”

“Impossible.  Not after losing that much blood.  So either you tell us what’s going on here or we make you.” 

The cop pulled out a chair and sat down, back against his chest. 

But I didn’t care.  Didn’t feel anything but a creeping dread from the news.  A bloodied girl with a crowbar walking down the 55.  But she was dead, she had to be.

The answer is blowing in the wind. 

Of course, they are wrong. But they don't know any better. They didn't have my Father. Father was great, he taught me everything. How to be a Man, and all the little things that make up that one, glorious whole. I hunted from an early age, I don't remember how old, exactly, but my earliest memory is that of him passing me a handgun, a Smith and Wesson. He smiled at me broadly as I felt the weight, the crisp metal outline resting in my hands, and his smile reflected in mine. 

I had other memories. The bottles clinking around his chair, the anger, such vitriol, a fury bounded by nothing more than his own physical limitations. But I always come back to that day, and his smile. His pride. 

Of course, the question was rhetorical. There is no precise number of roads required, or at least no answer to that quandary. But still they are wrong. Thanks to my Father, I am a Man. Thanks to my Father, God rest his soul, I am the only Man in this godforsaken place. These bright lights, these bickering imbeciles, they know nothing. NOTHING of what it takes, nothing of the sacrifices that need to be made to cleanse this helpless, lost planet. 

And so it falls to me. I must pick up the mantle, I must carry the burden, fulfil what my Father started. Open their eyes, let them see. They will understand, yes, but first they must be taught. 

I double check the wires one last time. They are good. I check the timer. All good. I step out of the van, leaving the radio playing, and shut the door behind me. I walk through the crowds, pushing through stragglers, already hidden amongst the shoppers. I turn down a side street, and I quicken my pace. A few moments later, I hear the crack of the shockwave, the bellow of retribution. Thank you Father.

I am a Man, and their screams are just blowing in the wind. "

I can feel it. It’s getting closer. It’s coming after me. It’s always lurking somewhere near. It follows my every move. Somehow it always knows where to find me. 

There is no place to hide, its shrieks would drive anyone insane.

There is nothing I can do. No matter how hard I try, even if I lash out with my hands and feet, it keeps crawling back for more. 

Because it has to feed. It wants to suck the life out of me. I have already sacrificed everything but it won’t leave me alone. 

They tell me that I will get used to it. They tell me that I will learn to love my servitude. But every time it reaches out to me with its tiny hands, I know I should have let it die."

*The Camptown race track’s five miles long oh doo-dah day*

I loved coming down here every Saturday to bet on races. The sights, smells and the good food served by the vendors all around the underground stadium were always a treat. And, of course, the main entertainment of the afternoon.

All of them were the cream of the crop, or so my father told me every time he brought me down here. Their manes were always well cleaned. 

Every month or so they’d bring in fresh newcomers from across the Atlantic. Some still were a bit wild, but for the most part they’d been pretty well trained. I do remember once when I was thirteen one of them got loose and began to run towards the stands. Sadly, the poor girl had to be put down for being too dangerous.

*I came down there with my hat caved in doodah doodah*

*I go back home with a pocket full of tin oh doo-dah day*

On my sixteenth birthday, my father gave me a few dollars and patted me on the back. “Today, you are a man. You get to bet on the races.”

I was so excited. Finally, I could place a bet of my own! As we entered the race track, I looked over at the stables where I saw the newcomers alongside the veterans of the race. I spotted a bobtail nag that seemed to stand out from the rest. She was a newcomer, I saw, with strong legs and what looked like a fierce determination in its eyes. I immediately placed my bet on the animal.

The race was extremely close, with some old favorites looking like they might win, but in the end, I lucked out. My bobtail nag had won. As I was walking to the stand to collect my winnings, I heard an older gentleman cursing his bad luck. He’d apparently bet on an old bay.

*Gonna run all night, Gonna run all day*

*I bet my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay.*

“Congratulations, young man,” the vendor said as he handed me my winnings. “And you’re even more lucky than you can imagine. You’re the only one who bet on that animal, so as such per race rules you get to keep her.”

I was overjoyed but looked to my father for affirmation. He owned a big ranch, but we might not have enough feed for another. His grin was all the answer I needed. Turning back to the vendor, I said, “Take me to her!”

She had been separated from the other racers in the stable and was eating some oats when I entered. When she saw me, she snorted and beat her foot down. I approached my prize and, smiling, began to remove my clothes. 

My new animal snorted again and said, “No! No mas’er!”

As I caressed her darkened cheek, I whispered, “You’re mine now.” I then began to tame her.

“Come on, give me a smile” smirked the Jerk that has come by my work for the 8th time.

“you’d look prettier” he adds. 

&#x200B;

I sigh and continue on with my wheelbarrow.

That’s one of the downsides of here, any creep that wants to can stroll straight into my life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love working at the zoo. I get to take care of spectacular animals, feeding the big cats is my favourite. 

&#x200B;

I get harassed a lot, and it doesn’t faze me much anymore. However, there is something about this one that feels different.

I actually knew of this particular Jerk, friend of a friend of a friend kind of thing. So, I knew a few things about him. None of them good. 

‘It is a little annoying how good looking he is for a creep’ involuntarily passes through my brain.

&#x200B;

The 9th time he came by was when it happened.

&#x200B;

Towards the end of a very long day was when he cornered me. Impeding my travel with his arm outstretched against the wall. Indecently close to me, I could smell his aftershave and feel his breath.

&#x200B;

“Hey pretty lady, you’re such a tease” I hear. 

&#x200B;

There was still so much to do before going home and my mind was oddly fuzzy. Like I was passenger and not driver in my body. 

&#x200B;

“Sorry, I’m errr, quite busy” I gulp as my vision goes hazy for a second. 

&#x200B;

Before I know it, he leans in and kisses me, catching me completely off guard. 

&#x200B;

‘fuck it’ I think, ‘it has been a while, why not’ as I regain my composure and kiss him back. 

We quickly move through the door behind me. The “staff only” sign, completely ignored. 

After a few minutes I break away, a huge toothy grin on my face. 

&#x200B;

“I told you you’d look prettier if you sm”…….. 

&#x200B;

\*Brzzzz  Brzzzz\*  my alarm interrupts his now slightly amusing comment.

&#x200B;

“Ohh fuck, its 10pm. I need to lock up right away” I say slightly panicked “I’ll be right back” I add with a quick peck. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Leaving quickly through the heavy steel reinforced door, he doesn’t notice as I turn the key and press a few buttons. 

&#x200B;

I know this aggressive Jerk is intending to cheat on his girlfriend. I know lots of things he doesn’t think are important, like how in the animal kingdom a smile has a very different meaning. 

A smile is a show of teeth, a warning. 

&#x200B;

I take my place on the other side of the glass enclosure, with some popcorn and a slush puppy. I always did like feeding the big cats. 

&#x200B;

1 cheater and 4 cheetahs in a cage. one of them screaming to be let out, 4 of them with big hungry tooth filled smiles.

One thing that tips me off is Rein. No. They're not close, it's just, my ideal guy, Noel, is always with her. There are rumors that they're really together, but some say that they are really just close friends. But frankly, I don't buy it. 
Close friends? Really? The  why do I always see their hands intertwined while walking down the alley? 

I wish that I never fell in love with Noel in the first place so I won't have this problem. 
I know Rein never did anything bad to me, but she always gets into my nerves. 

Her face looks innocent and so simple,she really looks weird. Like she was stuck in the 80’s.

But everything changed when my boyfriend broke up with me on the phone. I ran as fast as I could to the restroom and cried myself inside a cubicle. While I was crying so hard, smeone knocked on my cubicle.

""Are you alright? I saw you running on the hallway with teary eyes,"" Said the sweet innocent voice. Is it Rein?

""Is this Rein?"" I asked.

""Yes. It is. Hey, don't be sad. Let me tell you a story,"" she said sweetly.

""Ok. But I can't face you yet. I'm still not over with my feelings. It hurts badly,"" I said. Still crying.

""Ok here goes. My life was tragic. My parents were killed in our own house. They were killed in a very unique way. The killer made a story using their body, blood, and the main crime scene. It was so traumatic for me seeing them like that, and that's when Noel comes in my life. He was the one who gave me life, love. He was my love,""

Back on my mind I would reply, ""I KNEW IT. YOU ARE REALLY TOGETHER WITH NOEL!"" But I didn't. Before I could say anything, she said;

""I really love him, because I always long for a brother, now I have one. Having an older brother was the best thing I ever had."" 

""Oh. That's why she doesn't have the same surname with Noel. She was adopted,"" I whispered to myself. I was about to open the cubicle to hug her, but a manly voice rushed to the comfort room and shouted, ""Rein! Stop. Whatever you are doing. Get out. If you love me, please Get out!""

""But...but she's worth a story,"" she replied.

""No. Rein. Just don't. Get out!"" The guy ordered, his voice was familiar. Rein went out, and the guy stayed inside.

""Reese. Are you hurt? Did she touch you?"" It was Noel. 

He hugged me tightly which is sweet, ""I'm ok Noel. I didn't know that she was so sweet. I misinterpret her, she's nice after all.""

Noel broke down in tears, and whispered to my ears, ""She's a serial killer."""

I remember it extremely vividly and it was probably the most insane dream I've ever had in my life but the most terrifying thing happened after I woke up. I'll explain after I describe the dream.

It started with me in my childhood bedroom. I was there but it was like I was watching it on a TV screen. It felt like an out of body experience if you will.

My younger self was sleeping in the bed when suddenly he woke up screaming and crying as if he had just had a nightmare. My mother rushed into the bedroom. ""Andrew, what's wrong?"" she asked in a comforting voice.

Through horrified sobbing my younger self replied ""The man with no face tried to get me again! He said he wants to take me away with him to the scary place. Don't let him take me away mommy, please!""

My mother tried to reassure my younger self. ""The man with no face isn't real honey, I promise. He won't try to take you away."" That's when things became really unsettling. A huge hand emerged from the wall of the room, but it was made out of plaster. As if it was coming from outside the room and squishing the wall in. It grabbed my mother and my younger self tried to grab on but it was too late. The hand retracted back into the wall with my mother.

I woke up in a cold sweat. For a moment I was relieved that it was only a dream. However, I saw a piece of paper on my nightstand and for some reason I felt a huge sense of dread as I picked it up to see what it said.

It read ""You may have forgotten me Andrew, but I'm still here and someday I will take you away with me."""

Oh, the lies we tell ourselves. 

It was after my 4th beer that I decided to settle up and leave. It was around that moment, I think, that I first noticed it.

The bartender, who had unlocked the door for me when she opened. 

The busboy, who had greeted me as a friend while he dutifully sliced limes. 

The barback. A waiter. The hostess. 

Everyone was sneezing. 

The barstool I was seated at was separated from the dining area by a wall that held all the beer taps and booze, yet still I could hear it. From the families at the tables, drifting across the barrier wall. Faint, yet obvious. 

Ah-CHOO

“Bless you!”

“Gesunheit!”

“ex-CUSE me!”

One by one, more and more, sneezing. 
Into a napkin, into the crook of an elbow. Into bare hands tented as though in prayer. An incredibly daunting, ever-intensifying cacophony of powerful, concussive...well, sneezes. 

It was bad. It got worse. It seemed there was no end in sight. 

8 years later, I’m all alone.

They gleam and burst with the deepest shades of color while stretching into infinity, in every direction as if they were hands grasping towards memories and faces that have begun to slide past into oblivion. Best of all, they vary from person to person so no one death is ever the same as the one that had preceded it.

A documentary on culture yet culture has slapped me in the face. 

I felt as if I was being watched and
knew I was alone in the platform. As I hear the approaching clinks and vibrations of the train. I 
Felt a sense of dread that overwhelmed me!

   I boarded the train in a hurry quickly noticing 2 
Passengers. One was a little old Japanese lady and a person on the far end of the car wearing an old hoodie. As the old woman got up to get off I saw her eyes get big and she walked toward the door even quicker!

 But it's like she hesitated to get off or had a change of destination. She taps my shoulder and said ""come"" 
With a strange look showing. ""Come with me""
she said angrily!

   ""No!"" I said getting frustrated. By this time the door had closed and the train was moving as the woman stood there. I stared straight ahead and heard a sniffling sound from the old lady and from my far right I heard a gurgling sound like someone using mouthwash. 

The old woman was
freaking me out! I looked up at her and she was crying but not looking at me but looking at the far end of the car. As I started to look the same direction the old lady screamed ""DONT"".

   She quickly sat beside me. I was so scared!
She said ""look into my eyes girl"" as she proceeded to grab my hand!

 I tried jerking away but she had a tight grip and she smacked me hard! I was dazed a second and said ""please don't hurt me""
to her! As she gripped my hand she started speaking in Japanese so I didn't know what she was saying. 

   I was wondering why the girl at the far end of the car wasn't trying to help me. The old lady opened her eyes and looked into mine. ""DON'T 
look behind you child"", just close your eyes"" I could hear that gargling sound getting closer!

 I closed my eyes and all I could hear was a low Japanese prayer I assumed and a weird gargling sound slowly getting louder! I had to open my eyes up to see the old woman looking over my right shoulder her eyes wide and tears running
Her face.

   Then she closed them and continued praying 
And nearly broke my fingers! But I trusted her for some reason but that didn't help me understand the gargling sound that was now right behind me. ""Was it the girl in the hoodie""? I thought. 

I felt breathing on the back of my neck and coldness in the air! I had to barely open my eyes again just enough to see. But I wish a thousand times I hadn't!

 I saw a long neck stretched clean over my shoulder like a giraffe!!!

   But a woman's head with long black hair attached! Her head chewing on the old woman's face as the woman screamed! ""DON'T  LET HER CATCH YOU LOOKING"" and the head swung around toward me but My eyes shut just in time.
The chewing continued as the train screeched to the next stop! 

   I got up feeling with my arms for the door and put my hand on the old ladies face by accident or what was left of it. I felt my way all the way out of the train station and was, crying scared bc the gargling was always right behind me. I made it to my room after 4 hours and it should've taken 6 minutes. I couldn't hear the gargling so I opened them slowly. 
 
   I slowly scanned my surroundings and didn't see anything. ""SHEEEEW!"" I called the cops. I was so relieved I started crying and that's when I heard it! Gargling sound coming from the other room! My adrenaline shot Up as I approached entryway to the dining area. 

My heart was thumping in my chest like it was going to burst as I approached the noise got louder.

   I walked toward my bathroom and closed my eyes! Shaking as the gargling continued. I burst in the door and heard a scream! I opened my eyes and seen it was Dana my roommate. 

I let out another sheew dropping my head. She had been brushing her teeth and was arguing at me. ""You scared the""... I noticed her pause and looked up at her. 

I felt goosebumps as I seen her eyes looking behind me with a look of sheer terror! Too scared to scream and I felt the cold breath on the back of my neck. Hurry police........hurry.....

Not that there’s any shortage of snow, it just usually doesn’t come til January. Of course, then we get absolutely slammed, and that’s what I’m here for. I have whatever the opposite of wintertime blues is. As a young kid I was more a springtime kid, but now I absolutely live for snow, and the bitter cold. During the summer I overheat so easily I can barely leave my house, so during the winter I really relish in the little things like shoveling the driveway or having the kitchen windows open while I cook. It drives my wife up the wall; “there’s one in every house,” she’ll grumble, huddled up by the fire swaddled in blankets. But fortunately for our marriage, weather is really the only thing we disagree on, even in our decision to visit her side of the family this year for Christmas dinner. Of course, only one of us was thrilled to see a blizzard kicking up as we made our way there.

The turkey was just about done when her mom came running out of the living room, urgently trying to find my little niece. Nana had put little Sylvia to a nap about an hour ago, but she must have gotten out of the bed at some point. My nephew said he’d seen her go outside, bizarre mainly because she preferred sitting by the stove. Being the guy who likes the cold, I was sent outside to go find her. But the yard’s coating of snow was pristine: not a single footprint to follow, and it was still coming down pretty hard. After two hours of searching, even into the woods, I came back to the house empty-handed, only to find Sylvia had been inside the whole time. Nana swore she’d scoured the house, but Syl looked like she hadn’t even stepped foot in the snow.

It took a few years to notice, but Sylvia loves the cold now. Since then, every winter my wife and sister-in-law bring Syl over so I can build snowmen with her. Sometimes I find myself doubting my thoughts: maybe her freckles were *always* that dense, maybe her hair had been that curly beforehand. Nobody else seemed to notice her dark eyes turn a little green, though. I kept quiet, of course; I was so excited to finally get to be the cool uncle for someone, so it’s not like I’m gonna look a gift horse in the mouth. What am I going to say without sounding crazy, anyhow? Besides, I didn’t want my side of the family finding out and thinking the story sounded too familiar for comfort."

She did not ignore me like the girls used to do back at school. She did not tease me like the women of my hometown. She did not avoid eye contact with me, like the people who spoke badly of me. I would never have thought that someone like her would be interested in me. She was ethereally beautiful. If you wanted to describe an angel, it would have become a description of her. Her beauty had struck me immediately when she first entered the café where I worked the night shift. Her voice was like a song when she ordered her coffee. If I were my brother, I would have asked her for a date. But I'm not my brother. I don't bring home another woman every month. I would never have dared to speak to a woman like her. I got sweaty only thinking about it. All the more i was surprised, pleased, but also shocked, when she asked me if I wanted to go out with her. She was new to the city and needs someone to show it to her. I had to swallow and my voice broke as I tried to answer her. I felt like the nerd at school who got asked by the prom queen. I had to clear my throat 3 times just to press out a simple ""I? Yes, gladly."" I was panicking that I would have scorned her with my awkward behavior, but she just smiled and asked when I had time. Today I had time. 

&#x200B;

We met after sunset and had some drinks. She looked adorable. I was probably hopelessly overdressed for the occasion, but even in my finest suit I was nothing compared to her. Her beauty was superhuman and completely mesmerized me. She wanted to go for a walk through the park. The lights were already out, but she said the moon was bright enough for her. Her skin shimmered pale in the moonlight. Almost like porcelain. We strolled past the pond to the pavilion that was completely covered in darkness. As if in a trance, I followed her as she pulled me, holding my hand. She pressed me against one of the pillars and began to kiss me. I was so nervous that I was paralised and just let her do it. She kissed my mouth, my cheeks my neck. Then she bit me.   


A drop of blood ran down my throat. She was startled and apologized many times. It has gone through with her. ""All right,"" I said, wiping the drop aside. ""I like this."" Then I bit her.   


I pushed my fangs deep into her vein and drank to the last drop. I could not have wished for a better one. The first one I did not need my brother for. Too bad, she was nice to me, but as a vampire I have to drink. "

When their hulls grow thin and their engines weaken, they are abandoned by their crews. New, strange faces walk their decks, alien flags are raised, the ships are stripped of their names, replacing them with unfamiliar monikers.

The tired, aching vessels take to the waves one final time, bound for distant shores.

As they near their destination, their grinding engines are suddenly pushed to breaking point. The vessels surge forward, plunge up the beach amid the groan of metal and the splintering of stone, finally coming to rest in an eerie silence, stricken on the sand.

Helpless and immobile, they are slowly picked apart as the weeks pass, their hulls torn open and carved up, their innards ripped out.

Of course, this is just another industry - the scrapping of a vessel that's beyond use, salvaged for parts and profit. But any mariner will tell you that ships are more than an assemblage of bulkheads.

A vessel must have a name, and to consider each one an 'it' and not a 'she' is unconscionable to a sailor. A ship is shaped by human hands and designs, cared for by its crew, roars with the life of its engines.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

A consciousness resides within, a sense of purpose bestowed upon a ship by its captain and crew. The vessel knows that the sailors on board are its caretakers, and its role in turn is to shield them from the wind and the waves and bear them safely to land.

The mind of a ship is not like that of a human of course. It has no speech, no limbs to move, no eyes to see as we would understand it.

But mariners have long known that something of a ship endures beyond death.

For centuries there have been stories told of phantom vessels ploughing the waves, ghostly ships that linger near the wrecks that were their form in life.

But however unnerving a sight they may be, these spectres are nothing to fear.

Ships which go to their grave in the waters are at peace. As they slip beneath the waves, they are embraced by the ocean that has always been their home.

It is those vessels which are torn from the sea, butchered and desecrated for nothing but the value of their steel, that are to be feared. Abandoned by their crew, robbed of their form, bewildered and enraged. Their spirits lash out, bringing chaos to the oceans they retreat to.

Every year, the shipbreaking yards grow larger, more vessels torn apart on the oil stained sand.

Just staring at the box. In silence, in an empty, featureless room. This was my twelfth interview since graduation. And by far and away it had been the weirdest one yet. 

I'd received the interview offer in an email, short but succinct, nothing but a time and a place, and the promise of a job that would test my worth. I have to admit, by this point, I was desperate. I replied within minutes, profusely accepting and thanking them for the offer, so grateful someone had shown interest in me. I asked what the job might entail, the pay, but had received no response. As I said, I was desperate. Rent took priority, so here I was. With the box. 

It was a small, unassuming little thing, maybe the size of a shoebox, unmarked, but slightly crumpled around the corners. The lid was stuck  down with parcel tape. My hands were itching, my body restless. I had no idea how long I'd been here already, where the smiling gentleman and his silent, slightly unnerving colleague had gone, nor what it was I was supposed to be doing. ""Just relax, do what you feel is right"" - my only instruction, no questions, no ""what made you interested in this position?"" Which was great, because I knew nothing about it.  

So here I sat, readjusting my tie. Fighting boredom, resisting idle hands. For hours. 

The light flickered occasionally, maybe five times since I'd arrived. Finally, the gentleman returned. He glanced at the box and smiled.

""Thank you for your time, we'll let you know by tomorrow.""

""Thanks!"" I shake his hand, nod at the quiet one, and walk out the door. If I hadn't been distracted playing with a bit of parcel tape in my hands, I might have noticed the second shadow gliding smoothly behind me, hands outstretched, exploring its new home. "

I don’t care that you just bought a gym membership or that you have brand new Balenciagas. So listen to me, this is something I have to tell the world. 

You always pass by me like I don’t exist, like I’m not like you or at least was from some point in my life. You don’t talk to me, not even a simple good morning and if you look at me, don’t give me that pity look. I don’t want your laments, just notice me, once. Why am I out here? Did you do this? Did you make me forget again? Why are you so cruel to me?

You think just because you got the new car or new phone you can stomp on anyone who doesn’t have it.

To the marginate part of society. To the part society doesn’t even hate because they don’t recognize people like me exist. I am human waste, why was I born? Why do I still exist?  I’m just a constant reminder to humans of what not to be, of not what to become.

Why did I become this? I wasn’t born like this...I wasn’t born like this? I was born? I had a past? Had a family? Worries? Studies? A job? I was rich? I was a CEO? I killed the company? No. Killed my wife? Killed my kid? Set the house of fire? Ran away? I ran away into nothingness. I’m nothing. Not dead, not alive, but nothing. Okay this is to much. You made me tell you to much.

I know why,It’s because I’ll have to go to school,and I’ll have to go to gym,and I’ll have to see them.

&#x200B;

I’ve been getting bullied by these other kids in gym class for the past 3 months,I know I only have like a few more months to go until I can have a fresh start on second semester,but when lunch is over,I have to take that dreadful walk to gym where I have a good idea of what I’m going to experience.

&#x200B;

They push me,they slap my ass,they hug me and call me their baby,their lover boy. They call me coward,they make disturbing sexual comments about me,and coach does nothing.

&#x200B;

When I have to go to gym,I know what kind of hell I’m going to have to go through,what kind of sexual and verbal abuse.

&#x200B;

I’ve had enough,one day,I finally came to my senses and knew exactly what I was going to do about this problem.

&#x200B;

I skipped Gym Class,I hid in a bathroom stall and just sat there,using my phone to text as I waited for the period to end to go onto my next class.

&#x200B;

Then I heard gunshots,then screaming and continued firing. My mind raced,I knew exactly what was happening,a school shooting. I stayed in the bathroom stall,no way I was going out into the halls,out in the open with the risk of being shot.

&#x200B;

I survived through it.

&#x200B;

What happened,was a group of 3 men each wearing masks and holding guns rushed into the building and began visiting as many classes in the school with students in them in the time span of 10 minutes. They visited around half the classes in the school,killing around 200 students.

&#x200B;

How lucky I felt when I heard gym class was one of the classes visited by the shooters,every student in gym was shot to death. Why wouldn’t I feel lucky? If I didn’t skip gym class that day,I would have been shot to death like the other students,absolute luck that I decided to skip gym on the day of the shooting.

I’m lying in my bed right now, staring at the ceiling with bloodshot eyes. I can’t help but wonder when my neighbour will stop shouting. She’s been keeping me up ever since she shifted to the apartment next to me.

At first it was just minor quarrels with her partner which blew up into full fledged fights a couple of months ago. Most of my other neighbours have shifted out of the building in the past month. Unfortunately, I can’t until my lease gets over or my finances improve. Until then, I have to  put up with her without a choice. Even the landlord seems to be helpless. I don’t blame him.

I take a deep breath in and decide that I must do something about it. After all, this is finals week. I trudge half heartedly to the door. I had been avoiding her for some time now. I hate confrontations. I’m almost at her door when I feel a pang of guilt.

A month ago I had heard her shouting into her phone as usual. Disturbing my sleep as usual. Then I had heard her threaten that she would kill herself. I had heard a muffled gunshot shortly followed by silence. I had just turned over and gone back to sleep. Probably a part of me was relieved then. But that relief was short lived as she started wailing and shouting at night soon after.

I muster all of my courage and knock at her door. The shouts stop immediately. In a shaky voice I squeak, ‘Please. I know you are in pain. But I just want to sleep.’

*Excavating for a mine*

*Lived a miner, forty-niner*

*And his daughter, Clementine*

Clementine was the young daughter of Jeremiah Steed, a miner who lived and worked in the small town of Jericho, Colorado, the same place where I grew up. I was instantly drawn to her, her fair skin and ruby lips. She was an American Snow White.

*Light she was and like a feather*

*And her shoes were number nine*

*Herring boxes, without topses*

*Sandals were for Clementine*

She was the most tender girl I’d ever met, fairylike. She wore the cutest clothes and sandals. Sometimes across the street our eyes met. She first smiled at me, but the looks she gave me after a while confirmed she was scared of what her father would think if we were together.

Her father did eventually confront me, calling me a deviant and telling me to stay away. Clementine, who stood there looking fearful, looked at me, and I knew then and there that we were meant to be. I swore then and there I’d rescue her from her father.

*Drove she ducklings to the water*

*Ev'ry morning just at nine*

*Hit her foot against a splinter*

*Fell into the foaming brine*

One morning she was running around near the small lake chasing the ducks, sometimes getting dangerously close to the cliff that bordered one side of the lake. 

I rushed out onto the sandy shore. She saw me and her eyes widened. She looked scared, but I knew that she just wanted to tease me, the cutie. She ran, letting me chase her. The way she called out for help was so cute. 

As she ran, she tripped over a small branch. I watched as she fell over the cliff.

*Ruby lips above the water*

*Blowing bubbles, soft and fine*

*But, alas, I was no swimmer*

*So I lost my Clementine*

I rushed to the edge and looked over, hoping to get a glimpse of Clementine, but all I could see were ripples made from where she’d fallen in and bubbles coming up. Most women in Jericho, myself included, couldn’t swim. I looked around for a branch to save my beloved Clementine, but by then it was too late.

*How I missed her! How I missed her*

*How I missed my Clementine*

*But I kissed her little sister*

*I forgot my Clementine*

I watched the funeral from a distance, as I wasn’t allowed to attend. Jeremiah and the rest of the town were under the consensus that it was an accident. They knew about her duck chasing habit. I couldn’t believe my Clementine was gone. 

No, she was standing next to her father. She looked younger, with shorter hair and brown eyes instead of blue, but there was no mistaking that face. As our eyes met, I smiled. She would be mine, now and always.

*Oh my darling, oh my darling*

*Oh my darling, Clementine*

*You are lost and gone forever*

*Dreadful sorry, Clementine*

The couple had not seen any other humans for a few days, and the birds were getting hungry. 

""Jeanette, there's something I need  you to do for me,"" Michael began. ""We both know that only one of us can make it out of this alive, and that's for you to win. Please don't argue with me. I know I've always been the stronger of the two of us, but the new world will need your tender and caring heart for it to be reborn.""

Jeanette's eyes filled with tears at what she knew she had to do next. By sacrificing Michael, she could save what was left of the world as she knew it. 

She kissed him one last time before slicing open his belly. Shoving her hand into his body, she searched for his heart. It had to be here. There wasn't any place else it could be. Unless... 

She kept moving everything around until she clutched the organ. 

A shadow fell in front of Michael's lifeless corpse. It was indescribable and ancient, something older than time itself. It held an entire galaxy in his eight eyes, shrieks of civilizations lost echoed in its breath. 

Jeanette held the heart out to the creature, and the chaos surrounding her stopped.

Outside in the night sky, I could hear it. Slowly but surely, it was getting closer. Each dull rumble that reverberated through the air was like the roar of a huge creature intent only on destruction.  And it was looking for me. I moved around inside the house, making sure all the doors and windows were closed and locked as each loud rumble crept nearer. I could picture it. A huge, lumbering mass of immeasurable power and rage making its way towards the town. It was easy to imagine it as some forgotten god. The air got colder as the wind picked up and began to push against the house, rattling the windows and slipping under the doors. Each flash of light got brighter and more prolonged, momentarily illuminating the street outside as it searched.  Each crackle through the sky was like two steel weapons being smashed against each other, creating bright sparks as part of its war cry. Its voice shook the house as it roared, and the lights in the house flickered and went out. It was almost here. Soon the others would come.

Rain began to pitter-patter on the roof, lightly at first. Within seconds it was pouring down hard against the walls and windows. I hated when it rained. The rain disguises the others as they roam the ground. They are smaller. More agile. They swarm the lawns and encircle the houses, looking for any way in. Cautiously, I peeked through a curtain from my dark bedroom to the night outside. The rain was sweeping down the cold glass, distorting the brief images held within the bright flashes. I could almost see them. The great creature loomed high above the neighbourhood, blended in to the night sky. Its jagged form is seen only within the sparks of its weapons as they crashed together. In this bright flash, I could see the trees outside swaying dangerously in the wind, and debris tumbling along the pavement, crashing and banging along the wooden fences. I could also see the others. In that split second, I saw them crawling rapidly along the ground towards the houses. They will violently rattle each part loose if they can and will bring the ones hiding inside to the great creature. I should have moved away from the window then. 

Another long, drawn-out bright flash and another tremendous, guttural roar shook the house and the ground, and in that flash, they saw me. Immediately, they crawled all over the house, banging hard against the walls and the roof, ripping the shingles off in heaps. I ran down to the basement in the dark, feeling my way along the walls and locked myself in. The rain battered heavily against the house, but I could hear them. 

They are inside. They are searching. I hear the great creature looming above my house.  I can picture it with its weapons raised, ready to strike. They know I am in here. 

They will find me. "

We got to the room. Sacrificial Chamber 9. The guard opened the door. I saw two other subjects. Both with the same orange prison-like jumpsuit. I sat down at the last open seat. As the door closed, another metal wall covered it. All the lights went out. It was dark and cold. The smell in the air identified that someone has died here before. But then, a black light turned on. It didn't light up the whole room but at least we could see. I heard footsteps behind me. I looked and the others were still in there chairs. A sudden splash of blood appeared. One of the subjects fell over onto the ground. “OH FUCK!” Said the other subject holding their chair in front of them like a shield. However, I didn't move. The shock held me in place. All I could see was the deceased subject, and his blood pouring into the drain. A purple-like figure picked up the other subject and threw him into a wall. He dropped his chair on the ground. I got on my knees and tried to get it. But the figure spotted me and picked me up by my neck. It dropped me onto the chair. I felt intense pain on my back. Then the black light went off and the normal light turned on. The figure was gone. My chair flew into the air towards the other subject. The light turned off and the black light went on. I saw the purple figure with the chair busting the other subjects head in. Once he was dead, the purple figure threw the chair. He then looked at me, and tilted its head. I noticed that the purple figure has claws on its right hand. It walked up to me. Picked me up by the neck again and threw his fist into my chest. It impaled me multiple times before throwing me back onto the ground. I was starting to get nausea. My vision began blurring. The last thing I heard was “SCP 4037 Complete test.” Before I coughed up blood onto my chest.

During my early childhood, whenever I spoke of Aman or Riya, my parents would chalk it down to my overactive imagination. They became concerned after I crossed that age of having imaginary friends but continued to speak to thin air. They took me to a psychiatrist who laughed when I confided in her. She asked my parents to be patient with me as I would be growing out of that phase eventually.

The Dead were usually friendly; some lost, some sad. Some still coming to terms that they had passed on. But once, one of them turned violent out of shock of his death. Though he couldn’t hurt me, the damage had already been done. I was scared and scarred – so much so that we had to move. Not wanting a repeat, I kept to myself this time. Whenever I saw a dead person in my new neighbourhood, I just kept a straight face and plodded on ahead.

Many years have passed and I’m currently in high school. These years in between were best spent with my best friend Binny and his older brother Gru. Their company was enough to distract me from noticing the Dead. I finally became normal around them. My parents were happy to see their daughter making real friends and not talking about death all the time. But do good things ever truly last? 

Binny was killed a week ago. Shot in the face. In a neighbourhood of little reputation. What was he doing there? I don’t know. But it has been very difficult to pretend to not see him. My now dead friend caught me staring at him sadly a couple of times and I had to avert my eyes to ward off any suspicion. I had to remind myself that he was gone forever. Gru seemed to bear the brunt of it – he became sullen and withdrawn after that. 
I overheard some words like ‘accidental’ and ‘practising’ over the next few days. One day, as I was walking towards the classroom, I saw the Dead were excited and looking at each other in anticipation. Binny came in front of me and said, ‘Maya, if you can hear me – RUN’.

Before I could react, Gru, stepped into the corridor with a gun. Now I understood why and how my friend had died. I just hope I don’t join him anytime soon. "

Hello students,

In light of the tragic passing of Tom Cathton earlier this month, the university would like to take this opportunity to reach out to all our students and offer a hand in these troubling times. Tom's passing has deeply affected us all. He was a wonderfully gifted young man, commended for his hard-working nature by all those who knew him, one of our brightest students in his time with the Engineering department. Tom had a long career ahead of him and, we believe, would have made an exemplary alumni for the university.

On behalf of our student mental health initiative and in light of Tom's passing, we would like to share some important advice.

First and foremost, we would like to stress that these recent suicides reflect particularly badly on the university. Each and every one of you, at whatever level of involvement it may be, are representatives of the university. Thus, we kindly ask those with suicidal impulses to refrain from acting on them, at least until the term is over. Student councilling is available in the meantime. Students are advised to sign up for an appointment through the department's email. Students are also warned that the length of waiting times for such an appointment may vary. Your patience is appreciated.

We also have received several reports which students should take note of. Firstly, after the recent deaths there, it has been decided that students are forbidden from crossing the suspension bridge at night. Jumpers have been a real problem here especially - and our staff are having a difficult time retrieving bodies which have fallen from such heights. If you are inclined to act out on suicidal thoughts, please do not go out, but instead stay in your dorm.

Secondly, students are to take caution when walking across the park, not least late at night. While local defamatory news reports of stalkers in the park have almost certainly been exaggerated, there have still been some instances of students going missing. Anything suspicious - especially any strangers, offering lifts persay or being overly-friendly - should be reported to security. These cases constitute a minority of course that - I repeat - has been exaggerated by certain media outlets. We assure you that the park is otherwise entirely safe. Nevertheless, as a precaution, students should not walk back across the park late at night or without another person.

Finally, as the end of the first term fast approaches, so too should thoughts turn to pending exams. Let Tom's death be a reminder to you all: to study hard and make the most of your time here at this university.

Thank you all and I wish you a happy last week of term before your Christmas holidays!

*Vim Promovet Insitam.*

Your University Dean,

**Brad Henshaw**"

Especially since I live alone.

But I could explain that.

I must have tossed the blankets aside more roughly than I’d initially believed. It was the most likely explanation, and Occam’s razor directed me to take solace there.

So I picked up the comforter off the floor and wrapped myself in it.

Ignoring its unusual warmth was easy enough. 

I could explain it. 

It made no sense to think that something *else* would have been warming my blanket while I was in the bathroom.

And it serves no purpose to stress about these things while trying to fall back asleep. 

Because the night is *filled* with noises that have perfectly reasonable explanations. If we focus on a single bizarre sound, we’re likely to go crazy. 

There are plenty of things that *sound* like a man breathing.

I can’t think of many at the moment. But surely, there must be lots. And I don’t let the noises get to me. 

If I did, the soft groans from across the room would drive me crazy. 

And there’s no sense in letting it deny me sleep.

Everything is different in the morning. The daily high and low temperatures are 19/13.  My room feels fresh and new in the cold, bright light. It reminds me that a mood can change, but facts remain steadfast. 

It is a *fact* that the wet, sticky goo on my cheek is probably not from a stranger’s tongue.

That would make no sense at all. 

I’m *very* unlikely to see a man smiling over my shoulder in the mirror.

But I still make a conscious effort not to stare into its depths. 

I’m in and out of the shower in minutes. I’m not sure where my panties went during that time – I *know* I left them in my sweatpants, which are still on the floor – but what’s the sense in panicking about what I can’t control?

Even after the panic, we have to get back to work. Might as well just skip the part where we stress.

Admittedly, it would have been more difficult if I had tried explaining why I found them neatly folded on my bed when I came home that night.

But there are certain things we just plain can’t change. 

Like sounds in the night.

Or the creeping smell of body odor that *cannot* be your own. 

Dismiss the smells. 

Dismiss the sounds.

Turn off the light.

Everyone does it.

That’s how I explain it. 

It’s easy. Almost always, I can explain everything.

Or come close enough.

Or I simply choose not to explain. 

Tonight is slightly different, though.

The night air is starkly cold and sharply frosty. 

And I cannot explain the handprints that have been left pressed against the outside of my third-floor window.

Nor can I comprehend why there are just three fingers on each hand."

It started in the late 1970's.
I think. To be honest I can't remember, it's been that long. I remember it being a top secret, government funded, social experiment of some kind. A machine was developed to keep a human in a form of stasis for a period of time. The goal was to seal a person up, let them out every decade or so, and then have them document the changes they see in society. Kinda like a human time capsule. 

But I badly needed the money then, so I volunteered. I remember the Berlin Wall falling, our Twin Towers crumbling and our people becoming more corrupt.
Each time I was awakened, my bank account grew larger,  as society grew more sophisticated and divided. I had nothing going for myself so I decided to continue, easily making $350,000 each per session. I woke up in 2090 to a vaccine called ""AllCure"" Something that can cure any illness or disease. I remember the man who created it committing suicide. Claiming that it ""was a mistake."" I contemplated stopping the experiments, but I still needed the money. 

Then I remember waking up in 2101.
AllCure wiped out half of mankind. The other half turned into things that I am not able to see while inside this contraption. The stasis machine is recharging and I can hear them moving around outside, and making indescribable croaks and groans. I can get out if I wanted, in the window of time I have for it to recharge, but I won't. I've already established that it's not a good idea to leave the safety of this machine. I've decided to stay and wait till I wake up again in the future. I know it's not the smartest idea, but I do, after all, need the money."
a61t43,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a61t43/all_the_voices/,All The Voices,28,0,1544764641.0,"I dream during the day, but I don't think they're daydreams.

It's always a hospital of some kind, and I think it's a mental asylum.  I saw one when we took a field trip there, a few years ago.  But even if it's called that, I still think it looks like a prison―with bars for windows and chains in every room.  The building doesn't scare me, though.  The people do.

All my friends there seem sick, but no one seems to know what's wrong with themselves.  There's an Edward, and he's always angry and loud.  Jamison seems quiet, but I think I saw him try to break his bars once, so I keep an extra eye on him.  I don't think I've ever seen Simon's face, but I always hear his muttering―saying everyone's out to get me.  There are lots more, but I don't think that I would ever have the time to list them all.

When I'm there, I like to wander through the halls and play a game.  Usually―or always, I can't remember―I try to find who is yelling what.  The worn stone makes an twisty nest of tunnels, and sound echoes all over.  The patterns of doors and tunnels change from time to time, but I always find my way.  

The only time I ever see everyone at the same time is when we have a circular pattern.  I stand in the middle of the grey-stone walls, and everyone's doors peek out at me.  It's very loud, since almost everyone is yelling at me, telling me what to do.  I'm not sure how they see my life outside of the dreams, but they're always telling me the right things to do―eat this, don't eat this.  Trust her, don't trust him.  It was scary to begin with, but they're very helpful, so they're my friends now.  I always let them help.

Sometimes they tell me to do things that other people don't like, like when I plucked the petals off of a flower, or punched my neighbor.  But it always ends up alright.  My friends tell me that I'm more important than anyone else, so I'm allowed to do those things.

My mommy and daddy brought me to a special doctor.  We talked a little bit, then he said some serious words to my parents.  They told me later that the doctor specialized in learning kid's minds, and that I had a very, very special mind.

They called it schizophrenia.  I don't know what that means, exactly, but all the voices are telling me not to trust them.  I'll trust my friends.  They're always right, after all."

Mall Santa's suit smells like bleach and his beard looks like used cotton balls. Plus, he doesn't have the crinkles around his eyes like all the Santa pictures.

     He asks me what I want for Christmas, just like all the Mall Santa's do. ""X-box One,"" I say. Then pause. ""And a lot of games.""

     He pats my head and we smile for the picture.

     I met Real Santa anyway, a week ago in the park. Mama was talking to old Ms. Henley, and Ms. Henley talks a lot. I was on the edge of the park looking for sticks to build a fort when I heard someone say hello. I looked up at some old guy wearing a dirty brown coat and even more dirt under his fingernails. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

     He looked surprised by my question. ""I'm...Santa."" He laughed and his teeth were yellow. He looked like one of those guys Mama handed quarters to outside the train station.

     ""No you're not. It's not Christmas.""

     ""It will be."" He said. ""And I can prove it. What do you want for Christmas?""

     I smiled because he didn't look the type to have any money, so I knew he couldn't prove it. I told him what I wanted. He told me to sit by the tree on Christmas Eve night, after Mama went to sleep, and he would prove it.

     Dad was on his trucking route that night but he would be back by morning. I do as the old man said, and after Mama went to sleep, I sit in the living room by the tree.

     Finally, around 1am, I hear a door open and slow footsteps moving toward the living room. The Christmas tree lights illuminate his dirty brown coat. He didn't even dress up in his red suit. What a fake.

    He moves toward me, his arms extending a blanket. He couldn't even box and wrap the gift, this guy is a total fraud.

     I take the blanket. It's warm and wet, and it looks like there's a black snake hanging out of it. But when I open it, I smile. He's the real deal after all.

     See, what I wanted for Christmas was to hold my baby brother. I didn't want to wait another three months.

a5xsqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a5xsqi/the_procedure/,The Procedure,31,6,1544735882.0,"I sat at my desk, reviewing photographs from my most recent case.  Pillars of afternoon sunlight bathed the room in an amber glow and I smelled the familiar hospital smells of antiseptic and ether.

The first image was grainy and blurred, but I could make out the silhouette of a tall man, bent over and with impossibly long and thin arms. He stooped over a crib and appeared to be dragging one long, thin fingernail across the chest of an infant. The crumpled body of a woman lay at his feet, oozing blood.

The next three images showed the same scene, all from different angles; four children, all hanged by shoelaces from their bedposts, their faces bloated and distorted with decomposition.

I set the pictures down a with a sigh. I looked around my chamber and beheld the various diplomas and awards that hung there, seeming to mock me. What good was being voted alienist and neurosurgeon of the year for 1939 when crimes like this one, crimes where my involvement as a man of science was indicated, went unsolved?

My reveries were interrupted by my door opening and that dreadful orderly McKillop coming in. 

“What is it, McKillop? Can’t you see I’m with my photographs?” I said

He performed a perfunctory and utterly insincere bow. “Beggin’ your pardon…*doctor*,” he said with obvious mockery, then just stood in the doorway, jangling his keys.

“Well? Get *on* with it, man!” I fairly shouted.

“They’ll be needing you in the operating theater for a procedure in twenty minutes.” He said, then took a step towards my desk. “*Doctor*.” He smiled his crooked smile and I could see rows of tobacco-stained and missing teeth.

He then bent down and, queerly, swabbed the space above my right eye with a cotton ball he had concealed in his palm. I smelled camphor and rubbing alcohol.

“And after the procedure, *doctor*, you won’t be needing these pieces of shite anymore!” he said, snatching up my photographs and scattering them against the cement walls of my room. 

They were all blank.

“I’ll be back for you very soon, you – you… monster. Which is more than anyone can say for your poor slaughtered family,” he said, turning on his heel and slamming the metal door to my cell with a resounding final clang."

I kind of accepted it though but it doesn’t bother me anymore. 

One day I had woken up from a nap, and no one was home.  I thought they might just be neglecting me again, so I carried on.  I was walking to the bathroom and I heard a dripping sound from inside.  I opened the door to see my whole family lying dead on the floor and for some reason they all had weird holes in every limb of their body. Not like a drill not like a gunshot but something sinister.  I couldn’t scream and I was lucky because I heard the front door close, the murderer was still in here.

I ran feeling nauseous and hid until it left, I say it because it didn’t look human. It was like a foggy shadow. I ran out of my hiding spot only to notice it was still here and it saw me. I ran to the door and it had a lock I didn’t have a key for. So I ran to the phone to call the police and thought if only I could talk.  "

The four year old was screaming that he hated the dinner and wanted ice cream.

“Afterwards” she mumbled. The baby was hurting her nipple and she tried to move it. The mewling of the baby made her head pound and she abruptly stood up holding the infant. 

She dragged the older child to bed, his whining soon turning to gentle snores. The baby kept crying however, its  tiny face scrunched and red. It looked like a sun dried tomato she thought and laughed hysterically. 

Her phone beeped, 

“ILL BE HOME L8. C U IN MORNING X.”

Her husband had never left “text speak” back in the early 2000s. She didn’t reply. She had  seen the emails earlier in the week. His work colleague was very explicit and she had sent him lots of photos. 

He had been working late a lot since about 6 months into the pregnancy. When the baby was born he was on a business trip. The emails confirmed that the business trip had involved lots of fucking with a woman who clearly didn’t have children or the exhaustion that went with motherhood. 

The mother laughed joylessly again, startling the infant. It cried even more. She looked at the baby dispassionately. She had grown it inside her for 9 months but felt nothing when looking at it. Only tiredness, exhaustion and pain.

The doctor had said bonding would happen, these feelings weren’t unusual. Lack of feelings more like...the mother’s hysterical laugh rang through the kitchen again. The doctor had told her holding the baby would help. 

The mother held the baby, pulling it close to her breast. Her right hand supported its head. The right hand pressed the baby against her. The baby’s face was wet to the touch. Its  crying was muffled and soon it was silent. Its skin was blue. 

The mother sat down and cried. "

what if zombies could understand and interact like normal humans.
What if the undead were cunning enough to live among us without revealing their identity?
Hunting their prey without anyone else noticing?

What if it had already happened? Centuries ago. What if zombies lived among us once?.

What if only a few people noticed them and tried to kill them for good? 
Tried to stop them from returning?

What if the rest of the population at that era weren't afraid of the zombies?

What if the first ever book written about zombies, doesn't tell us a tale of horror but of worship?

What if the one man, who rose up from his tomb and walked the earth, with two holes in his hands, three days after he was buried, wasn't so frightening? 

What if instead of being afraid of them, they were considered Messiah?"

I turn to see where the noise is coming from, and I’m blinded by a sudden flash of bright light. I squint my eyes closed, and when the light fades I look up and gasp at what I see. An angel hovers in the air. His wings stretch out towering above the trees in an endless array of beautiful golden feathers. His timeless face glows with light, and he looks down upon me sternly like he knows all my sins. The angel opens his mouth to speak but then I see him tense, and I watch horrified as blood as colorful as fire blossoms out from all sides of the sword that now protrudes from his chest. The angel screams; a loud, high, and unworldly screeching sound, and evaporates into dust. I watch frozen as the sword that had pierced the angel falls to the grass and as the dust floats away in the wind up to the heavens. A dark shadow steps up into my view; it picks up the sword from the ground and out flicks a long, snake-like tongue from its mouth and licks the blade clean. I try to run but I discover I can’t move; I'm frozen in place. The shadow looks down at me, and all I see is black mist and red eyes. Suddenly I can move and I stumble to the ground.

He's a pretty cool guy. He can play some pretty fine tunes on his instruments and he wouldn’t hesitate to share his food with me and damn his foods are amazing. Even though there is a language barrier between us, we became best friends pretty quickly. We would hang out and watch TV together. I have absolutely no idea what any of his films are saying but it is always entertaining to watch. We would go jog together and often play frisbee. Even though I feel that he has an advantage with being taller and all but I always have a blast playing frisbee with him.  

Lately, he hasn't been the same. It’s like he is being possessed by a demon. It began when I noticed a strange dark aura around him that holds him down. Slowly I caught faint glimpses of a demon lingering on him, following and occasionally harasses him. My friend doesn’t seem to be aware of the demon. I tried warning him but he can’t understand my language. Slowly we stopped jogging and playing frisbees together. Every time I tried talking to him, he always gently refused as he forces a smile breaking his emotionless face. One time, he was about to play some melodies, the demon appeared out of nowhere, grabbed his wooden instrument and toss it across the room, smashing it. My best friend started sobbing uncontrollably but he still doesn’t noticing the demon that’s been draining the life out of him. Eventually, he was constantly in bed. Sometime I can hear him crying in his room. I kept knocking on his door asking if he was ok but he doesn’t answer me. 

The last straw was when I caught him sitting in the bathroom bawling his eyes out as the demon held a razor blade against him. I immediately dashed into the room “Get the fuck away from him.” I roared at the monster. I quickly went over my best friend, hugging him, padding his shoulder and his head telling him“It's ok buddy, I am going to protect you, everything is going to be alright.” But I don't think he's understanding what I am saying, he continues to cry. I started licking the tears off his face and continuing to reassure him “I won’t let anything harm you.” I was so anxious I can feel my tail wags uncontrollably. Eventually, with enough licking, my friend busted out the warmest smile I have ever seen. He reached over and hugged me back, laughing and crying at the same time with tears still streaming down his face. 

That was the last time I saw the demon. The very next day, my best friend invited me out for frisbee again. I still feel like he’s at an advantage since he has arms and I have to catch it with my mouth but I always have a blast playing frisbee with him. :p

I am notorious for cancelling first dates. I am a bad date, always ghosting plans. 

Give me a chance, you said. 

Okay. 

I know you wanted to ask why I always cancelled plans. 

The pasta house.

You are so beautiful, he says. He wraps his arms around my bosom and his hands fondle my secrets. He breathes in my scent. He kisses my neck.

""Hey Hey HEY! Watch it, you guys!""

""Kids! Be careful around daddy's camera, alright?"" Martha tried in vain to calm them, but was met only with giggles and giddy shrieks in response. 

I took a sip from my beer, just enjoying the warm summer's breeze grazing the skin on my arms as the noise and hubbub faded into the background.  Birds tweeted happily from their branches, bees flitted between the flowers. An almost heavenly afternoon, I thought. 

""Right, guys, only a few minutes now, so I wanna see you all wearing your glasses! Come on kids you don't wanna miss this, it's the gonna be the show of a lifetime!"" David fiddled a bit more with the camera, and ran to Martha to grab a pair of glasses.

""It's moving quick, isn't it?""

""Shhh, hun. Let's just enjoy this.""

The shadow moved slowly, but surely, covering a quarter, a half, three-quarters, and then the whole. I let out a gasp as we were plunged into darkness, the corona visible like a halo, the birds suddenly silenced. The hairs on my arm stood up in the sudden chill. 

And, as quickly as it had started, it was over. Light began to return, the disc of the sun revealed itself again, and I felt the brush of the warm rays once more. 

Waiting until the shadow had departed completely before saying anything, I finally uttered a simple ""Oh wow"". There was nothing but silence. 

I removed my glasses and felt around for my beer. ""What did everyone think? Was that something or what?""

The room in my childhood home was dark, cold and as lifeless as a leaf in December. My throat was dry, so I decided to get up and get a glass of water, but just when I was about to leave my bed it felt like I was held in place by a metallic shell fitting my body perfectly. I started panicking, I couldn't move an inch, even if I wanted to. The fear got real when I saw someone standing like a dark, menacing creature as coldblooded as winter itself. I tried my hardest to scream, but nothing came out. 
The creature came closer and closer. My scream came desperate and panicked when i could move again. The creature dissapeared fast and swiftly then, and my parents came bursting down the stairs like a buffalo horde.

I have had my share of sleep paralysis almost weekly from then, and there are always some distinct details when it happens.

1. When I wake up, the room is always cold, like the coldest day of winter.

2. The creature is always there, it's dark shape hanging like a drape over the room.

3. I always wake up before the creature gets to my bed.

Becuase of all these things, I decided to call the creature Mr. Winter.

I'm 21 now, so I'm not scared anymore by him. 

Well, until recently, that is.

He shows up every nigt now, and everytime he does show up , Mr. Winter reaches my bed. He then proceeds to whisper something in my ear, his breath like icy winds on a mountaintop. It wasn't until recently that I realised what he is telling me. Numbers. It's a countdown. Last night 7, this night 6. What is he counting down to? I guess time will tell.

This night's number was 1. I thought something would happen, but it didn't. I have honestly never been so frightened in my entire life.

I tried my best not to go to sleep tonight, but of course I did, eventually. When the paralysis came, I noticed that something was off, but I couldn't put my finger on what. Mr. Winter stood in his regular corner, and then proceeded to move to the side of my bed. Then I realised what was strange. I could move. He came up to my ear. 

""Zero"".

""What do you want? What the hell are you?"", I said.

""Oh, you already know that"", he said while a bony hand was swallowing a cold chuckle.

That was when I realised my heart had stopped."

Often credited as the world's shortest poem, it's undoubtedly the manifestation of a genius; a unique use of the alphabet in a impactful and open-ended composition.

Recently, I had a short interview with its creator, Aaram Saroyan, and realised that the true nature of the poem was much, much darker. 

This would be his first and last interview, for he was found dead as a result of suicide soon after this encounter.

Aaram and I sat in a small room. Instead of an intellectual and optimistic author, I saw a emotionally disturbed potential sociopath.

""Hello, Mr. Saroyan. I would like to start off by saying that I absolutely love your one word poem. When I first read it I was very confused, but the more I look into it, the more complex it gets.

...

Mr. Saroyan?""

He seemed to stay lifeless. His reactions and body language was almost nonexistent, and, hoping to keep him engaged, I continued.

""You know, I think of the poem as an extension of emotion and curiosity. The reader is forced to think what sound the extra 'gh' in 'lighght' really makes, just like we are forced to think how we fit into the lives we are given.

I like to think of the word as a lighter, fluffier version of 'light'; a more transcendental illumination, almost like the word 'light' doesn't do it justice. It is this refined and pure illumination that we seek in life, and it is this poem that perfectly describes it in one simple word.""

He sniffled. It was like he tried to suppress his laughter, but failed. However, there was something strange. The laugh he tried to suppress was maniacal one.

""No. No, no, no, no, no.

There is no illumination. There is no emotion. There is no life.

You know what sound the extra 'gh' makes in lighght? The sound of death.""

He smirked, came close to my face and looked straight into my soul through his bloodshot eyes. Tears rolled down his face. He laughed and cried at the same time.

""I killed her. I killed her. I went to her room and saw her playing with a torch, repeating the word 'light' over and over. She didn't know what was going to happen. She cried, but there was no one to listen.

I dragged my daughter out into the forest and mutilated her with a box cutter. Straight to the neck.

I watched her slowly bleed to death. I ended a life, one of my own blood. I don't know why I did it, but it was fun. She died painfully and mercilessly.

Most of all, she died inhumanely; a death that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. I slaughtered her.

And, do you know what her last words were, as she lay lifeless, gargling and choking on her own blood?""

He came closer and whispered into my ear, in a voice that attempted to imitate that of an infant in misery.

If I couldn’t quit for my health, then I could do it for my unborn baby. Unfortunately, willpower was never my strong suit.  Patches, sprays, chewing gum—each product I tried, my nicotine cravings inevitably won out. How I adored the lingering scent, the velvety heat, the tightly-packed crunch between fingertips.

Discouraged, I turned to my co-worker, Max. That man had gone from smoking like a pipe to being two years completely tobacco-free. After a bit of bribery, he finally confessed to me his secret. In an office cubicle, Max produced a wriggling, black insect from a paper bag.

“These rare Ethiopian leeches” he explained cautiously, “feed off of feelings of attachment”.

I scoffed, unconvinced. *Leeches?* But Max wasn’t joking.

“Just remember—once its teeth have bonded to your skin, nothing can *ever* remove it.”

Doubtful but dead-set in my resolve, I allowed the squirming creature to be lowered onto my back. I felt a sharp prick that quickly subsided. And there it was. A dark, rectangular blemish on my skin, but a fair price to pay for kicking my smoking habit for good. Weeks later, already starting to question Max’s “cure”, I found myself walking straight through a column of cigarette smoke outside.

*I felt an aggressive wave of nausea rise inside me.*

From that point onwards, my disgust towards cigarettes only intensified. Before long, I could think of nothing grosser than a smoke, reaching the point where I felt the violent urge to rip ciggies out of pedestrians’ hands and stamp them on the sidewalk. My addiction was gone.

Abigail gave birth to my first child in August, a boy we named Benji. The bond I felt with that baby was indescribable. How I adored the smell of his soft hair, the warmth of his pint-sized body, the touch of his playful hands. It brought me such a renewed sense of purpose to call myself his dad.

This morning as I get into the shower, however, I do a double-take.

There, on my lower rib, a few inches away from the original, is a *second* leech. Impossibly, it’s as if the first creature has split itself evenly in two. As I fret over this new development, Benji’s animated crying sounds from the bedroom.

His wife, Madeline, for similar reasons had been ecstatic when Douglas came home one night with the knowledge that the farm they had been eyeing was now their own.  They packed their bags and left as soon as possible, and upon first arrival it had been perfect. That first night, they laid together in bed and made love, two souls entwined under an infinite night sky without a single sound besides the crackling of the nearby fire.

But as the months rolled on things had gotten worse.

The crops they had planted began to fail as the soil turned into mud without a single drop of water having fallen on the ground. Douglas and Madeline began to fight, words thrown like daggers without a single care given to the new life Madeline had within her. At night, she could feel the baby kicking while she cried as if each tear came from the baby as well.

3 months after they had first arrived, mud began to rise from under the wooden floor of the house and filled the house with the overpowering odor of sulfur.

Douglas was infuriated and stormed out of the house that night.

Money had begun to dry up and the fights grew longer.

Douglas couldn't find the man who had sold them the rights to the house, asking around it seemed like the man had never existed in the first place. Douglas began to drink heavily, and somehow even those dark bottles began to taste less like the alcohol he craved and more like muddy water.

Madeline always hoped that when she gave birth everything would return to normal, and that the man she had fallen for would come back to her at the sight of their child. As it turned out, even as the day grew closer, Douglas became more distant and came home even later until one day he never returned. She feared he had cheated and ran off with another woman until the officers arrived at the homestead to tell her that her husband had been found dead in their car halfway sunken in a nearby swamp. In her nightmares she would see Douglas, his bloated corpse covered in the same mud that had ruined their lives, his smile wrapped around his warped face until she would awake in a cold sweat.

Eventually a midwife came to the house to assist in the birth as was the case for most births at the time. Madeline screamed into the night and she pushed and pushed but heard no babies cry.

Instead, the midwife held in her hands a corpse, pale and limp.

And as Madeline wept she recognized one thing...

Her baby's body was covered head to toe in mud."

Look, I'm not stupid. I know that you shouldn't order things off sketchy websites. But...this was different. My boyfriend ordered it for me, he said it was the original place that LUSH got their products. Cheapass. 

So naturally, after we broke up (loud, short, and to the point), I had a ""spiteful girlfriend"" moment where I realized that I should use it so that he couldn't possibly ask for it back.

The last thing I remember before I blacked out was feeling a wave of exhaustion as I dropped the bath bomb into the tub. The day had been overwhelming. The breakup, combined with a shitty day at work...it was all too much. So I didn't notice when the bath bomb didn't thump to the bottom of the tub. I didn't notice a clicking, whistling noise emanating from below the surface of the water. 
What I did notice, what would have been impossible not to notice, was the uneven tapping noise that emerged from the tub, and the long, spindly, spider-like legs that the bath bomb pulled itself from the water with. 

I screamed, naturally. And now I'm awake. I don't know where it went. I've been hiding in the bathroom for three hours, and I don't have my phone.

The third cubicle seemed acceptable.

I locked the door and hung my bag on the broken plastic stub that used to be a coat hook. I was about to lift my skirt, then quickly grabbed a wad of toilet paper, spat into it, and wiped down the toilet seat. Despite the protestations of my bowels, I took a few more seconds to lay down strips of paper. Finally, I eased myself down onto the seat, ready to relax.

No sooner had skin touched thinly veiled, cold plastic, a piece of folded paper skimmed across the floor, bouncing against my foot.

Everything clenched up.

I leaned forward, tilting my head to try and peek through the gap between door and floor but could see nothing.

Picking up the paper, I started to unfold it, my mind racing at the possibilities of what it might say.

I'd finally settled on the idea that another girl was in trouble and she was trying to ask for help without alerting the person threatening her. I'd heard about stories like that, and my heart was racing as I pulled open the page, tightly folded several times with unnerving precision. The note was handwritten, but the letters looked more like they had been scratched out in long strokes rather than the usual curves and loops you'd expect.

**I'M WAITING FOR YOU**

I stared at the words, rereading them again and again. Was this some kind of prank?

I could hear a slow, raspy breathing beyond the door.

My first instinct was to go for my phone and call the police, but it was in my bag. Besides not wanting to make any more noise by moving, I was still awkwardly sat on a toilet, half exposed and quite desperate to relieve myself.

I didn't have a choice. I needed my phone. I leant forwards again, starting to lift myself.

A hand came over the door, snatching the bag by its strap and, as quickly as it appeared, it vanished again, taking my bag, my phone - and any hope of calling for help - with it.

I wouldn't go quietly.

I screamed. Loud and long. I thumped the walls of the cubicle, trying to make as much noise as possible. I expected it would prompt an attack and I sat, waiting, but nothing happened.

For a moment, I thought I'd scared them off when another piece of paper hit my foot.

**SCREAM MORE. NO ONE WILL COME**

My bowels relaxed, letting lose everything I'd been holding in, and I felt ashamed at the noise.

""Please,"" I begged, ""leave me alone.""

The part of me that was still holding onto the hope that this was just a sick joke melted away as something growled, then began to push against the door. The wood began to split at the hinges, and the metal bolt squeaked as it bent.

He had fallen asleep on her warm embrace.

She took the warmth away with her; it was suddenly cold now. So cold, and so lonely and silent..

He gasped in his tears and suddenly opened his swollen eyes, waking up still half drunk with a massive headache, in the freezing cold camping tent in the mountains.

A riptide tugged at her toes, and pulled her mercilessly under.

So many people were with her today, it made her feel safe enough to explore without worrying so much.

As she swam the fish surrounded her, all colorful and distractingly pretty.

Maybe they all had too much to drink, but it had made her forget. 

Any sense of regret had left her and she felt giddy. 

Climbing onto the diving board, she reached her arms out and felt a strength that indicated she was finally prepared to move on.

Soon they were all ready to get going. 

The boat roared and the motor churned as they sped across the open water. 

Above them, the sun shone in the sky and the seagulls chirped.

A completely automated home, he could control from his cell phone or through voice commands. He was a lucky man, alright. Or, maybe, John wasn’t so lucky. He knew from the start that winning something like this would be like winning the lottery. No fat chance in hell, he thought. But he said to himself “fuck it!” and filled out the contest form. What did he have to lose? John questioned himself. Well, maybe, there was something he could lose. After John submitted the contest and three days passed, he received an email. Of course, like everyone would act, John fell off his chair after he read the email. He stood back up, sat back on his office chair and shook his head. 

“I fucking won,” he softly said to himself. He didn’t want to sound crazy or anything since he was in his work’s cubical at that time. No one wants to hear anyone talk out loud to themselves, John knew that for certain. It makes them look crazy and freaks people out. Ever see a man having a full-blown conversation with himself in the store? Certainly, you take your eyes off the crazy person and focused on shopping. Sure, people often point and laugh and even upload their shitty cellphone videos to some site to get views.  

John clicked on the link, not thinking so brightly—especially on his work’s network—and not giving a shit about network compromise, to validate his prize. *Well, I’ll be damned!* John thought. *Unbelievable.*

Three days or so, after John moved into the Smart Home on Corbin Street and Turnpike Ave., he noticed the house was a bit funky.  There wasn’t something quiet right, John noticed. The house became glitchy and full of defects. Maybe after a bad storm that night when John moved in, the glitches started. A lightning bolt struck his new home, go figure. It was uncanny just like the time when a new cardinal was elected in the Vancian—a few years ago or so. 

John woke up to an odd smell. A smell that alerts you of presence of gas. A strong punching aroma after you turned on your stove, and the electric igniter made “click-click-click-click” noises but didn’t ignite the gas. He rushed to the kitchen.  He found himself having trouble breathing fresh air. John’s failed attempts to open the windows made him panic-struck. 

“Karen, Scan for gas leak!” he shouted to the Smart Home’s listening device mounted on the ceiling. Karen was the Smart Home’s Advanced AI. Alexa would be most likely jealous of her capabilities. But the Red Queen was ten times more advanced than Karen. 

“You wanted me to turn on the stove, is that correct?” Karen asked through the ceiling’s speaker. 

“No! Karen, check for Gas leak.”

Do it.*** I whisper to myself ***jump off the roof of this parking garage and you’ll be lying spread eagle on the ground over there.*** And my brain involuntarily pushes me back. 

That is the call of the void. That hard to resist urge to see what it would be like to do something terrible but not wanting to do it at the same time.

 These urges prevented me from going out often because one day I feel like I wouldn’t be able to stop myself. I won’t want to stop myself. But I grew tired of not being able to breathe in fresh air and feel the wind upon my face. Months passed while I huddled in fear of causing my own death. It wasn’t long before I had no choice but to go out. My aging mother passed away in her sleep. There’s no way I could miss her funeral. There’s no way I could let my fear rule over me so much that I refuse to say goodbye to my mother forever.

 I get changed, and prepare myself mentally. The devil inside can not hold any influence over me if I don’t let it. I take a deep breath and step outside and I start to walk. I got outside without an incident and I watch the road and the cars driving by. ***Jump in front of that car*** my voice tells me. I shake my head and start running down the sidewalk. I’m not dying today.

 I start to relax as I near my parents house. Only one more block to go and I’ll be able to see their house. I stop at a road near a bridge and wait until I can cross. I avoid looking towards the bridge and try not to listen to the crashing of the waves. My hands have finally stopped shaking from fear. I can make it. My fear can not control me.  I close my eyes and remind myself to breathe.

 That’s when a chill sets in. I open my eyes to see a little girl with dark eyes watching me. I know instantly what she is. The voice in my head. ***Jump*** she whispers and beckons me to the bridge. “No,” I whisper to myself. I’ve almost made it. She will not win. I look away from the girl and quickly step onto the road. I forget to look both ways.

The last thing I hear is a girl giggling"

She loved her parents and her 5 year old sister Eve a lot. Her parents were willing to learn and teach her sign language. Her best friends Charlotte and Carly learned it so they could understand her. She wished she could say how much she appreciated that.                       But that was not the worst part.                         Ever since she was a kid, she had wanted to sing.

No, the worst part was the day she saw her sister get snatched away by one of them. How much her parents cried for Eve. How they got blamed, and found guilty- and she can’t tell anyone she knows they are innocent. Hazel cries, knowing her sister is likely dead, and her parents are rotting in some jail cell for a crime they did not commit. Yes, Hazel thinks as she is going to a foster she knows nothing about, with parents who can’t sign. This is the worst part."

Folk should help each other out where they can, and it's not like anyone's had a crop to harvest these last few years. No one goes out to scatter seed. None of us could afford to waste grain like that. But we got to sow the salt. 

It's the only thing that keeps the creepers away. When it melts in the rain they start growin' in, so you gotta do it regular. 

Authorities tried all kinds of other things when they first found out. Spraying 'em from the air, releasing strange kinds of bugs to eat them away. Even tried burnin' 'em. Coatin' whole forests with that oil that sticks like glue and just throwin' a match. Seemed to work at first, but next day folk saw new creepers sproutin' out the ashes. 

Weren't many of us left by the time we figured how to stop 'em growin'. 

They all look different. Must be why it took folk so long to see 'em. Flowers of all colours, leaves in all kinds of shapes. 

You don't know its a creeper until you touch it. 

Pa says it looks a little like poison ivy used to, least at first. Your skin gets red, real itchy. Worse thing you can do is scratch but it don't really matter either way - there's nothin' you can do. 

Pa didn't let me see what happened to Sophie after she got stung. He kept her out in the barn to tend to her, then one day he just said she was gone. I saw the mattress she'd been restin' on though. It was covered in red and brown, all shiny like it was wet still. Pa burned it in the field. 

Pa used to say that it was the authorities that must have made the creepers. Some experiment they cooked up to make it easier to grow food on farms like ours that must'a went wrong. 

Sophie said Pa was wrong though. She said it was the plants and trees and all else that grows that wanted rid of us. That this was the world trying to shake us off, like a dog scratching at fleas. 

I think that's why she went out past the edge of the field. She said she wanted to touch the flowers. 

Pa nearly got stung too, hackin' away at the creepers to get to Sophie, draggin' her back. They were grown back up again the next day though. 

Salt's the only thing that keeps 'em away. 

Pa says we'll be OK, that there's enough salt to last us for years. 

He don't like it when I ask how much food we got left."

Girls just aren’t interested in me, they don’t want to be seen with a pimple-faced nerd. And I don’t really blame them for holding such reservations. I have some myself. Talking to them. Being next to them. Dancing with them. It would be too stressful. 

So, I’ll just stay home tonight and read some manga. Call me an otaku or a weeb all you want. But I’m not ashamed. I love the characters in slice-of-life gag strips. They can be just as real.

I wake at night and rise from my bed, and when I turn I see myself still asleep. For what purpose this happens, I do not know. 

One night I arose once again with out form. I stayed myself in the corner until the sun stained my upper walls. I thought it strange, the morning had come. But I would not wake and my soul began to numb. 

I came to my sleeping body to feel it had become cold. Only a nightmare this could be, but so real it had seemed. This was when I truly began to fear. 

I laid myself down and shut my eyes. But when I arose it was to no avail. For only now my skin was pale. 

I hurried to the door but found I was unable to leave. For the further I was, the less I would be. It was then I began to scream.

More days and more nights passed. All my soul was now lost to numbness. And there my body still lay, now a rot in my bed. 

And though just a spirit I was, my ability to smell was no less. Eventually, my stench was discovered and my body addressed.

Weeks, perhaps months had now passed. Yet even still, I could not escape. My mourning soul began to turn to hate. 

A new tenant had come to live in my room, but he was oblivious to my presence. Desperate for contact, I began to bang the floor and bang the walls and call out to his name. 

Years of maddening loneliness had gone, and my soul had become enraged. 

One night while he slept, I threw my self at the legs of his bed. To my surprise l had knocked the frame and woke him from his sleep. 

—

I laid there in bed, not daring move an inch. There it stood still at the foot of my bed. For as long as I had been there, I could feel his presence. And there he was. The spirit of the man who’s heart had failed him while he dreamt. "

Ms. Richards is a round young woman with rosy plump cheeks and always wears a carefree smile no matter what. As a chemistry teacher, some may expect her classes to be boring and filled with lectures, but they would be wrong. In fact, she's an excellent teacher! Nobody ever fails her tests and she makes learning fun with creative experiments.

But still, nobody likes Ms. Richards.

Perhaps it's because she always seems to talk down to them. Or perhaps it's because of the way she will stare at a student a little too long before responding to their question. Either way, Ms. Richards is a little too detached and unnerving for anyone to like her.

However, her uncanny attitude would never deter  the troublemakers. Students would spread nasty rumors about her in the hallways. A few would giggle and tease her behind her back. One child even slipped a tack onto her chair. When Ms. Richards had yelped from the sting, the entire class laughed. Ms. Richards then joined their mirth with a laugh of her own after a moment of silence.

One day, Ms. Richards started class and began her experiment for the new lesson. Despite what the students thought of her, everybody would pay close attention to their teacher's demonstration. She stirred a clear liquid into a beaker before adding a small dose of powder that caused the liquid to bubble. Every student sat at the edge of their seat in anticipation as Ms. Richards smiled and told them to watch closely. As one, the class crowded around the beaker in excitement, shoving the plump teacher away. 

Suddenly, a thick fog erupted from the beaker. The mass of gas dispersed over the classroom. The students screamed and clutched their blistering throats. Those that were closest to the experiment fell to the ground violently hacking phlegm and blood. The others turned and rushed to the exit, coughing as their throats started to swell. Many collapsed before they could reach the door but those who did were horrified to find it jammed shut. One by one, they succumbed to the poisonous chemicals and fell. 

The last child standing, feebly banged his fists against the door, hoping someone would see his desperation through the window and save him. 

The only person he saw was Ms. Richards, standing and staring safely in the hallway with her carefree smile.
 In that moment he knew.

Ms. Richards didn't like them either.

As we all sipped  hot coffee and discussed  where we were going that morning, I was   in pure bliss, I was finally considered a man and I had all intentions on being the one who brought home the meat for Christmas dinner.

We drug it back towards the house. 

As we cleaned and quartered my kill I was being praised for my stealth and skill, My dad told everyone “ He is a chip off the old block.” I couldn’t wait for dinner tomorrow, to see the look of satisfaction on everyone’s face. 

The next morning we opened our presents and I could smell dinner cooking, it smelled delicious, my mouth watered just thinking about it. When it finally came time to eat the table was set and in the middle was that delicious roast. As I passed the potatoes  Uncle John said “ Im glad you got him, I’ve been eyeing that playground all year, I knew you would get a chance at your first kill there,  that boy was skittish It’s a  wonder you got that close to him.” I nodded with a smile and went back to eating , mother sure knew how to make a mean roast.

Your head bobbed up and down in agreement but I already knew your mind was thinking of vacations to Greece, fine wines, leather shoes, a new horse, and all the other things you’ve always wanted. To be honest, I loved that look on your face.

 When it began bubbling into the well and turned it to a murky black, I began to worry a little. Why hadn’t that happened before, I asked. You told me to relax, that when we pop the oilfield it shifted the pressure so it had room to work into the well. I accepted that answer because what did a farmer’s wife know of the workings of oilfields and geology? That wasn’t my specialty but thinking back that wasn’t yours either.  

 I told you somebody was watching us that night, but you told me to sleep. You were tired from working with the sheep all day and you told me I was imaging things. I told you I wasn’t, that there was somebody in the yard. You got up and went downstairs. I heard you load the shotgun. I heard you go outside. I waited. I waited for so long. Then I heard you scream, I heard the blast of the shotgun, and I screamed. I ran to the window and looked down.  

 I saw stars. A field of stars staring back up at me. Then I noticed they weren’t stars. They were eyes. God, they were eyes! They were yellow, diamond shaped eyes! They saw me!

When the wall that is reality crumbles, and the world shifts around them to a blank plain. Few people can comprehend the emotion experienced when their reality breaks. Everyone's reality is equally strong. However, some people live their lives feeling emotions that become a weapon against their wall. One such person is an eight year old boy by the name of Johnathan Myres.

Johnathan has lived his life being abused by his mother; no day would go by without there being a mark on his body his mother put there. She would scream at him and beat him. Every day. And over time, after all the abuse, he became numb to all the pain. He now feels nothing when he is slapped and yelled at. Not sadness, anger, or fear. Just the deep empty abyss of nothingness.

One night, while Johnathan slept, his mother went out to get the mail. She found a cigarette butt on the sidewalk in front of her house. As soon as her eyes laid upon it, his name popped in her mind. ""Johnathan."" The anger swell inside her instantly. She constantly blamed her son for everything for so long that she fell into a twisted belief that anything bad that would happen in her life would be Johnathan's fault. Even if it wasn't, which was the case the majority of the time. Johnathan woke up that night to a slap across his face and his mother screaming at him while shoving the cigarette in his face. Johnathan sat up in his bed, facing his mother. But not looking at her. He wasn't paying attention to her, or anything. Je starred blankly ahead. Emotionless. His reality had broken. All the numbness from the abuse became an acid that corroded his wall. He was dreaming before his mother awoke him. He was happy. He was dreaming of joy, a happy family. A happy life without pain. And the slap was the push that broke his wall. As his mother screamed at him, his reality distorted to a dark plain. The screaming faded. He starred straight ahead into the nothing before him, where he lived for the rest of his life. No pain. No fear. No joy. No sadness. No love.

Nothing new. Nothing."

Her mother, who once had the power to grant dreams insulted Morpheus, the god of Dreams, so publicly and humiliatingly that Morpheus took her power away and CURSED Mara to a life of misery and terror… The life of a nightmare.

Morpheus had made Mara into a beacon for nightmares. Mara knew every nightmare and they all existed in her touch. Mara had a good heart, so she swore to herself that she would never touch anyone again because that is how the nightmare’s inside her spread to other people. But it’s impossible not to touch anyone forever. The first time she forgot to be careful she touched her mother's fingers when she grabbed a glass from her mother’s hand. The lightest touch of fingers was enough to cripple Mara’s mother for three days and nights while Mara sat by her bedside, unable to stop the plague of terrors. The second time Mara accidently spread nightmares was when a bully tried to push her. All the neighborhood kid knew that something was wrong with her to say the least, but one day a girl went too far and started harassing her for not letting anyone touch her. That girl ended up passing away a week later due to psychological damage from the nightmares. The third and last time Mara touched someone was when she fell in love. Love changes everything, does it not? The man she fell in love with wouldn't stay away no matter how Mara tried to make him hate her. Her true love couldn’t bear not to touch Mara and touched her face despite her vehement protests. That touch lasted too long, and Mara watched her true love wither away into a corpse as the nightmares ate through him.

Mara couldn’t stand his death; she was done. There's no way she could go on like this. And so, Mara took up a knife, and with the intention of never spreading her torture again, plunged it into her heart. But as Mara slumped to the ground, the nightmares trickled out from her death wound and spread out across the world with nothing left to hold them back."

I stooped down slightly for the iris scan and could see a figure clad in a rough, linen robe seated on the metal bench and facing away from me. 

He stood as the door whooshed open, but still faced the porthole.

“I am Commander Pool of the USSC *Lightship.* May I ask what business you have beaming aboard?” I said to his back.

He turned and I could see a ragged wound on the right side of his upper abdomen, dried blood surrounding it like a halo. His long brown hair hung lankly below his shoulders, matted in places by blood that had dripped from a series of puncture wounds that encircled his forehead.

“Jesus!” I said, beholding his face.

“Yes, my son?”

In the porthole behind him, I could see all the lights of Earth go out, one by one. "

But I'm not motivated by profit. At least, not the kind you can spend in any mortal realm.


I inherited enough so that I never need to work again, anyway. But I have a hobby which keeps me occupied.


I own a patch of land, deep in a freezing forest. Far away from prying eyes. The hard soil covers several shallow graves. Everyone beneath my babies died in a truly terrible way. How do I know this? Don't ask.


Ha ha, “my babies”. Doesn't that sound cute? But I do love every one of my products like most mothers love their newborns. Though mine never loved me. Boo hoo.


There are always six hundred and sixty six. When one graduates from my blasphemous kindergarten, they are replaced. “666” sounds like a dumb heavy-metal cliche, I know. But whilst some of this satanic shit works and some doesn't, I try to throw as much tender loving evil into my hobby as possible. It's not an exact science, but it gets results.


It takes a decade to bring my babies to true fruition. Over three and a half thousand nights spent chanting, incanting, begging, pleading. Sacrifices, too. Not just my own time; we're talking dogs, cats, rabbits, anything domesticated, loved. Dogs are best. I've always been more of a “dog-person” than a “cat-person”. I've honed the art of pet-napping so perfectly that I could write a guidebook. But then who'd buy it? Maybe one or two of you weirdos reading this story.


Blood soaks through the soil and nourishes my many children. Yellowing grimoires costing a year of your salary are duct-taped together after years of enthusiastic usage. Curses which can curdle someone's soul in seconds are screamed into the darkness, night-after-night. And my babies grow. I can hear them whispering venomous ambitions when I place my ear to their feet. gnarled fingers rap restlessly, sighs of anxiety swirl in stormy gusts. If they had stomachs, they'd rumble like thunder.


Then December comes, and I load up my truck. You might have seen me, by the side of that desolate patch of road, just outside town. You might've even stopped and took out your wallet, tempted by my insanely low prices (like I said, I'm no businesswoman).


I scan the local newspapers each January. I find the news-channels so vulgar. Small-town stories of sadness and tragedy are infinitely preferable. I smile with delight as I read about the evils I've spread. But my widest smiles are saved for the little kiddies who see me, stood on the roadside with my magic-markered sign, year after year; it marks something significant in their small, shortened lives.


“LOOK, MOM! LOOK, DAD!” they yell, their eyes dancing like a puppy in an oven. “THE CHRISTMAS-TREE LADY IS HERE!"""

I am a fully grown man, for the most part. But my arm is not. It is still growing. Little by little, and it won't stop. I am scared of what is gonna happen in a few years. It frightens me and the people around me.

I cry every night before I sleep. It is getting too heavy and clumsy, and I am exhausted. Maybe I will have to cut it off too, like I had the left one seven years ago. But then life will be even harder.

I used to be a bodybuilder, and got into some cheap experimental substances. But those guys simply vanished. Ran away from the police on a rainy cold morning. When I got to their place looking for my daily dose, I had to tell the cops everything I knew, which wasn't much anyway. Then they let me go free. But ever since that time I feel more imprisoned and hopeless than I could ever conceive. My body is my prison, it will ruin me slowly until I rot away from existence.

Some of my old time friends from the long gone college time gave me a business card of this doctor who could help me, maybe.

I am here now, waiting. His place is cold and damp. It is not strictly legal so to speak. He usually takes care of.. abnormal stuff. People in desperate need of help and peace, like me. Like the dying old siamese sisters on the life support staring with sad eyes at me. Like the blind obese kid biting his own fingers off and crying. I want this to end. Please.

The doctor calls me in. There is no receptionist, no nurse, anyone else. It is too risky for him.

He tells me to lay down and relax, and to start telling him about my problem. I am lost, nervous, tired.. don't know where to start actually.

This sharp pain on my neck, a needle? 

What did he pour into my veins? Warm. Hazy. Sleepy. Am I dreaming? I hear my college friend's voices thanking him. One of them whispers on my ear, ""I am sorry. We are all sad. Hope you die painlessly. We always loved you""."

Like prisoners, they’re aching to break free from their shackles and live amongst us in the real world, but we can never truly know who or what is real. This is your mind at its utmost creative state: equal parts fascinating and terrifying. 

Last night, around 2 am, I had trouble falling back asleep after a brief three-hour stint. Most people would be thrilled to know they still had several hours of sleep left before they had to get up and go about their daily routines. All hope was lost once my eyes adjusted to the darkness. The bathroom door I had always kept open so my cat could use his litter box was completely shut. Soft, asthmatic breathing pulsed from the other side.

It sounded like an older woman living out her final moments on her deathbed. Frightened, I tried to shuffle quietly out of bed, but as soon as my feet touched the hardwood floor, the wretched breathing came to a halt. Frozen in place, I smothered my own breath to avoid making anymore sound. The bathroom light flickered on, revealing a pool of blood leaking underneath the bathroom door. After taking my first breath in what seemed like forever, a steady, thunderous knocking erupted from the other side.

The knocking continued for a solid minute, not once changing its speed or rhythm until the bathroom light suddenly gave out. The haunting silence reigned once again, followed by the door slowly creaking open. Inside the pitch black bathroom, all I could make out were a pair of feet dangling above the pool of blood, swaying back and forth, wiggling with little life leftover while drops of blood jumped from jagged toenails.

The light started flickering on and off repeatedly, revealing a middle-aged woman dressed in a bloodied white gown hanging from the ceiling. Her body slowly twisted itself until she was facing me, but her long, dark locks masked her face entirely so I couldn’t see. She raised her hands and began to part her hair out of the way, but before I could see who she was, the light cut out once again. A long, drawn-out, piercing scream emerged from the shadows.

It's not the perfect life, but I get by somehow. Working there gives me enough to survive, and more importantly, gives me something to do.

Over the years, I have realised that the network of the underground tunnels extends a lot farther than the operations of the mine. It seems to be an infinite maze of catacombs, with many caves and tunnels left undiscovered.

I had always been curious to explore these unknown places. The town was too small for my tastes; finding an isolated space away from my typical life comforted me. Often, I would find myself returning back to the mazes after my work hours, walking into areas that the carts didn't travel to.

The biggest path that lay unexplored was a wide subsidiary tunnel that the main tunnel split into. The rails for our carts led to the tunnel on the right, so the one on the left was entirely mysterious. It continued infinitely into the darkness, giving it an almost haunting aura.

In the recent months, however, there have been unusual cases. People have been reported missing. Particularly, men who worked at the mine. One by one, wives lost their husbands and children lost their fathers. No one knew what had happened to these men.

The mining work soon diminished. Today, after my shift, I was back in the mine, and took a left turn into the wide, mysterious tunnel.

I walked for what seemed like a long time. The tunnel never seemed to end, with the lights getting dimmer and dimmer to the point of almost no vision.

At that point, I entered a larger chamber. And then, I saw it. A large pool of blood. A collection of human bodies. Bodies of those missing men. They were mutilated beyond what the cruelest mind could imagine. The smell of death was putrid and overwhelming. Brains sprawled on the floor, decorated with flesh and intestines.

I heard a clicking sound. I looked up, and saw a dark figure running towards me at full speed.

I panicked, but my reflexes did not fail me. Instantly, I pulled out my pistol and shot the figure straight in the head.

He came close to me, and fell limp in front of my eyes, where I could see him. He was just another miner, wandering into places where he shouldn't be.

Another body added to the pile. Looking at the entire scene, I let out a long sigh as my face broke out into a grin, and the words inevitably escaped my mouth.

I submit it to Judge Phelan today July 7th 1868 in place of testimoney as I can not speek.

Tom Grant and me were cooriers on the Pony Express. He was entrusted with vital mail from New York to hand off to me for to carry down the line, and me to take it to the next man, and so on down to San Francisco.

But after he came to my station, and before I could mount up to ride away, harsh snow fluries hit hard and drove us indoors to stay. We did not know it but this storm was to be a long one. We stayed in that station together from November until this last February.

Our first fears was of starvation. We could melt snow to drink and the fire would keep us from freezing, so we were very glad to find that the stockpiled rations were sufficient.

We could not tell midnight from high noon and our sleep was corespondingly disturbed. The unGodly noise kept us awake when tired and woke us while sleeping, which rapidly became our favorite subject to loathe together. The winds and the ice sleets combined into a neverending assault on the senses, akin to the great cannonades of the recent war.

I carved a rough chess bord from wood chips and so offered him sport. His relief was palpable. And so we played I know not how long. We slept dozens of times but could not judge how each day was alotted. And chess became our life.

We played thousands of times. Our skill became matched. Every game became stalemate. We were driven to violent rages because neither of us could win or lose. We both lost our reason at times. I misremember many things and will not dwell on the details.

I do recall the day I killed Tom Grant. We were sitting at the wooden table with my chess bord between us. The fire crackled and the wind screamed at us. The bord was a stalemate and Tom was shaking like a sick dog. We had run out of words weeks ago.

He took out his Bowie nife and rested the hilt on the table. Our eyes met. We understood each other perfectly. Having exausted all other distractions, there but one way to pass the time until spring. I nodded my agreement and drew my nife too.

The fight was terrible as we were almost feral. Your honor has seen the corner's report. I won.

I reckon I killed Tom Grant around January 22nd, for I slept ten times after and I am told the storm broke early February.

I regret I cannot testify in court for since that dark winter I have not uttered a word. I fear I might be mute forever but it is in God's hands now, as is my soul.

I sat up in my bed instinctively. I quietly reached for the torch and knife I keep in the drawer on my bedside table. I had kept them there for situations like this. There had been many break ins reported in this town – rising during the holiday season when most of the folks had gone on vacations. And I didn't want to take any chances. 

The kitchen was flooded with light now – I could see the light dancing on the stairs outside my bedroom. How brazen! They must have thought that there was noone home. I scamper to the closet and hide amidst the long coats. I almost smack my head when I remember that I forgot my phone under the pillow. I hope it won’t be required. Maybe, it won’t come to that.

Growing up in a tough neighbourhood,I have been in such a situation before. I’ve learnt that I must take deep breaths, be patient and come out when the noise has died down. I can hear the kids running up the stairs now. Must be excited to be back home. Well, it’s *my* home now. I’ve made myself comfortable here for the past ten days. So what if they built it? They shouldn’t have left it unguarded. And I’m not ready to give it up just yet.

“Look, babe, it happened again,” she gripped his arm tightly. For two weeks, at precisely the start of the witching hour, the door inches open immediately, not a soul outside to be seen.

“You know, the whole thing that your mother said about this house being evil, could it be true?” her voice wavered with uncertainty.

He did not reply. They stood still at the top of the steps, watching the open door with a certain sense of trepidation and suspicion. The open door ushered in a gush of the cold winter air, and they swore they could hear the slow and faint ringing of a bell come along with it. A bell that chimed once and twice, heralding something bad, something horrible that is to come. 

At 3.05a.m, the front door slowly swung to a close. 

“Let’s go back to sleep and figure things out tomorrow.” He placed a hand on her waist reassuringly, returning to their bedroom for the night. Perhaps he’ll look for a new place; after all, you always listen to your mother’s words, especially when she insists she can sense a malevolent presence in and around this place. He simply has no intention of being the next homeowner to be violently murdered in his sleep by an evil spirit, you see.

\*

The masked man checked his watch. *3.05a.m.* Right on the dot, he tugged on the fishing line and pulled the flimsy door to a close. Crouched behind the wall, he dropped the dagger into his duffel back. Maybe tomorrow will be the day when the timid homeowners will find the courage to walk to the front door and close it themselves, he thought, and he can then finally put his dagger to good use. After that, the deaths will simply be blamed on the violent ghosts that definitely exists on the property."

&#x200B;

Their colors were fractured by the morning dew, baby blues against the charred green of the juniper. They demanded attention, growing tall, with buds reaching upward begging to be touched. It honored the cats perfectly, I thought. My friends and husband gave the flowers the attention that strays never received.

&#x200B;

I’m not eccentric, I just care about things people try not to notice. People plant flowers on graves all the time, but not everything gets buried in cemeteries. Everything deserves to rest in peace.

The lupines were content underneath the patch of evergreen trees. I thought that’s where the fox would’ve been the happiest. I found her in the winter, chewed up by frost. Her ears were crumpled like paper, and her eyes were icy slits. Her body rested under the warm soil, and sunlight stroked her flowers.

&#x200B;

My husband treasured my garden, but only the bees knew it’s secrets. They busied themselves around each memorial, giving life to fragments of the dead. Bees need to feel valued or they’ll abandon their hives; perhaps, that’s why I never saw them near gravestones. I told all my secrets, from each corpse in my yard to the life that grew inside me. They repaid me with honey and company.

&#x200B;

My favorite flowers grew wild. The bees never touched them, and I dared not. Ghost pipes have no chlorophyll—they’re white and translucent, from flower to stem. Their roots cling to beech trees, the way infants cling to their mother’s womb. In my garden, they held onto something much stronger. My little ghost pipes peaked from the moss, their heads hanging in mourning, with dew clinging to them like tears.

Her date, the tall drink of water with brown hair and blue eyes sat next to her, smiling.  Finally, she thought, Tinder pulls through.


The tavern they were in reminded her of an old western saloon, with its dark wallpaper, wall sconces, and brass features.  The umbrella stand even looked like an old spittoon.  “Where did you find this place?  I’ve never even heard of it.”


“My office is around the corner, we come here for happy hour sometimes,” James said.  “Awesome specials.  Tuesdays are jumbo shrimp night!”


Kimberly laughed.  The bartender was bringing her a new draft.  “Excuse me, where’s the restroom.”


The bartender nodded toward a set of stairs past the bar. “Up there and to the left.”


Kim winked at James and headed towards the stairs.  They creaked and moaned under her feet, telling Kimberly that the bar didn’t just LOOK old.  It was old.


A narrow hallway was at the top and even though dim lights hung from the walls, Kimberly couldn’t see very well.  The cheerful noises and laughter from the bar seemed so far away.


She walked to the bathroom door and pushed inside.  Somehow it was even quieter.  She couldn’t even hear the bar anymore.  She hurried up and did her business, then bustled to the sink.


She washed her hands.  The lights flickered.  Kim froze.


Suddenly she realized just how quiet it had become.  The quiet was almost heavy.  It crept up her back and weighed down her shoulders.  It tickled her ear and moved over her mouth.  The hair on her arms stood up and ice rain through her.  In the mirror, as she stared into her own wide eyes, the door to the bathroom stall she’d just exited slowly and deliberately closed on its own.


That was all she needed.  She flew out of the bathroom, down the hall, and took the stairs two at a time.  Her heart was still racing as she got to the ground floor.  James looked concerned as she sat down next to him.  “Everything ok?”


Kim nodded, not really sure what to say.  She took a nice long drink of her beer. “Yeah.  That’s one creepy bathroom.”


“You’re not the first to say that.”


Kim looked at the bartender. “Oh?”


The bartender smiled.  “Bet you didn’t know this was the 2nd oldest building in the city, did you?  The first brothel here actually.  What’s now the bathroom was a room for one of the working girls. Story goes that one day when she was entertaining a gentleman, his wife came in and shot them both dead before turning the gun on herself.  She’s usually harmless, but if doors start moving on their own then get out.  She doesn’t like you.”


The ice began to work its way back into Kim’s veins.  Out of the corner of her eye, the front door of the tavern slowly creaked open."

So I was dreaming David Lynch and I were discussing a movie I don't think exists that the guy who played Cooper in Twin Peaks directed. He suddenly said ""Dont look"" naturally I looked over and there was a plainly handsome man with hazel eyes. He said "" You shouldn't have looked"" and his face turned into a skull covered with leathered skin. I decided it was time to wake up and I was in a stadium bathroom, I felt the need to run but everytime I turned the corner to the exit i was back to my starting position, I realized I was still dreaming and knew something was very wrong. When I stare at something my vision greys from the edges inward, everything started to grey and I was filled with dread once I knew I was dieing in my sleep and this was how my brain was processing it. The grey started to be replaced with a void and my dread was replaced with a profound nothingness. Apathy and emptiness were different sensations from this. From my feet up I became part of the void, my nothingness came with clarity. I shouldn't have looked at the story of a strange dream."

I went to the local pawn shop, to look around a bit and to see if there's anything new worth buying. As I was looking around, I saw the preetiest sight I could want. They had one of the first Fender Stratocaster electric guitars for sale, and for just 50$. I was stoked. I asked who was selling it. The dtore owner told me that old mr. Smith had brought it in about a month ago and said he needed to get rid of it. I know him, he died in a car crash about a week ago. Sad, but I bought the guitar anyway.

As soon as I brought it home, I plugged it in and played it. It sounded heavenly. I played it for three straight hours. That night, as I went to sleep, I had a terrible nightmare. I couldn't remember what it was, I only remembered a distinct classic old guitar tune in the background, but couldn't remember where from.

The same nightmares, with the same bloody guotar tune persisted every night from then on. I would wake up in the middle of the night, sweaty and terrified to the deafening classic guitar tune, that progressivly got louder in my dreams. After a week, it sounded as if it was coming from the guitar. One night, as I woke up, I could swear I heard the guitar play that melody, and when I checked it, the strings seemed to vibrate.

As the constant nightmares were driving me insane, I decided to go see a doctor. On the drive there, I was listening to the radio in my car, when it started to play. That goddamn guitar tune from my nightmares. I was shocked, so shocked that I failed to see the red light and the blaring ligjts of the truck, hurdling towards me. "

Every few evenings, I’d be woken to a soft knock on the door and ask him to enter our room as I switched on my reading lamp. He’d look up at me with big, brown eyes that shimmered from fresh tears and mutter the same words.

“There’s a monster under my bed,” he’d whimper in a soft voice with a trembling lower lip. I’d call him over for a hug and reassure him that there were no monsters, and most *certainly* not in his room. I’d walk over with him time and time again and take a peek in the shadowy darkness, sometimes a bit creeped out myself. Each and every time, I’d sigh in relief then show him the vacant space, and eventually, he’d get back into bed and fall asleep.

It was a routine I assumed he’d grow out of, but he never seemed to. He was always talking about the growling, the whispering the scratching under the bed in the night, but of course, nothing was ever there. I even checked the closet, drawers, and vents, every nook and cranny just to put our minds at rest, but it was clearly a child’s imagination and nothing more. I’d considered the possibility of a rodent as the culprit, but no pests were to be found aside from the odd fly or two.

When the flies arrived in droves, we overturned Justin’s room, vacuuming and clearing out snack wrappers and scrubbing melted candy and juice stains. The buzzing insects kept coming, however, and when I moved the bed to clean, I found it felt a bit too heavy. I grunted as I slid the mattress away from the wall, revealing a long slit running down the side that spilled out loose stuffing, and my blood froze. I knelt down and peered inside to see the still body of an emaciated man within, a horrid, toothy grin frozen under his staring eyes. Then they blinked."

The irrational fear that you could not wake anyone up if you needed them. If you tried to tell them something, to drive away despair with the lamp of companionship, they would turn away with the disregard of fatigue and the haziness of sleep. Curiosity, wondering if this is how the last man alive will feel.

The dream where something is coming. You must lock all the doors and windows. There are too many to check and you can't move fast enough. What if it's already inside?

You're lying half-awake on a pleasant Saturday afternoon. Big and little, near and far, back and forth. Big, little, near, far, back, forth. Oscillating faster and with greater amplitude. It's much too wide, it's not possible. It's much too thin, it sets your nerves on edge. You stand up, turn on the lights and the universe sets itself right.

That one dream, you know which one. The one with the presence. It's your old house, but something is horribly wrong. You're drawn to the center where it waits. You look down at it and it fills the room. There's nothing but pure fear, embodiment of evil, distilled terror. Alone at night, it makes you shiver to ponder it.

You wake from a nightmare and walk to the kitchen for a glass of water. You look at a window, black and empty. What if I actually saw something right now, outside looking in. Something from a nightmare. Something impossible. 

That maniac face. It only exist late at night in your imagination. An intrusive thought that occasionally sneaks in. At first you entertain the idea out of curiosity, wanting to watch it transform, to see how mad it gets. Occasionally you hear it scream in your head, like a phantom hypnagogic noise. Then it truly scares you. You push it out of your conscious mind long enough to forget for a time."

Or it really was some otherworldly creature banging scratching and punching the outer husk. Travelling all alone in space is scary.. you are really alone, no one else in any direction for a looong distance that would take days to travel. When all your electrical equipment has been fried by an ion storm, it is even scarier. Outer cameras and sensors are off. Nothing works except for the meta-combustion mechanic engine. You are simply cut off from other people in any way possible. But you can still fly.

Have to keep going. It is good that I enjoy flying manual and know the way. And I know the way is long, slow, silent and dark. Might take three to four days.

My ship is small and cheap. Not the safest choice to travel without a group. Oh well. Maybe I'll go check a ship retailer when I land, after I get the payment. This time I am gonna get a hefty payment for a change.

Food is also on the low side, starting to get scarce. These snacks are good though. Alcohol is good too. Keeps me warm and the stress away. One more sip.

Looking out front the small window, I long to see even the faintest sign of anything else other than the nothingness. But from experience, it will still take a couple of days before I can actually see the tiny planets popping up in the distance. I miss landing and actually being around other people. I am actually a bit drunk now, but being drunk all alone in here is no fun.

One more sip. The gentle warm breeze coming from the air conditioning system above actually feels cozy.

OK, last snack before dozing off. I am really tipsy and relaxed, feels good. I reach behind my seat and feel around the bag. Is it.. empty already maybe? Ah, ok, found one. It's.. funny.. slimy? IT MOVED! WHAT THE HELL!? Wait why is the air conditioner growling...??!!!"

in the night.

I am not scared of these.
Sure, they might be interesting, but what’s to fear?
Personally I’ve never encountered any of the lot, and I doubt anyone else can honestly say they
have either.

Others are about serial killers, murderers, psychopaths. These are closer to reality, but I
don’t fear them either.
Not directly at least.
I fear not the person themself, but what is deep inside them that drives them. The urge to
extinguish the sum of a human life. A unique, individual experience gone from the world at the
whim of another.
That is what I fear.

When I walk down the city streets at night, I fear not the thiefs, gang members or drug
dealers.
I fear the circumstances that drove them to such dishonorable professions.
The institutions that cast away and marginalize their fellow man in the pursuit of some sort of
arbitrary hierarchy, only to dangle down some false empathy like a fisherman reeling in a living
creature for sport.
I fear the soldier with an innocent civilian in his gun sights, just simply following the
meaningless commands of someone far away with far more wealth than him. Actions in the
name of some lofty ideal like every warrior before him.

I fear the radical, willing to give their life and that of anyone who stands in his way in the
name of some ancient bedtime story meant to keep people in their place. The lengths man will
go to give meaning to a world so often devoid of it.

I fear myself, filled with hubris like I know something, deep down recognizing that I don’t
even know what I don’t know. Trying to make sense of a planet filled with such stark
dichotomies and contradictions as if I wasn’t the 108th billion person ever trying to figure this
shit out.

In the end, I fear not the night or its inhabitants. I fear the darkness that is inside each
and everyone of us. It is up to you if you let it win."

No matter how much I want to just let her go, I am pulled along on whatever crazy adventure is next.  It’s maddening, unable to resist her aura, unable to pull away.

But, this place, this big, spooky looking Victorian mansion, its very presence says run. Exactly the kind of place she is drawn to, exactly the opposite of what I feel. I suppose that’s why we are so good together, she with her fearlessness and me with my constant worry.  Now, I just had to see what would happen this time, see if I would need to pull her out of a situation or if she could do it herself for once.  

She climbs in a window, why couldn’t she just try the door for once?  I will never know.  This place is not inviting, at all, whatsoever.  Whatever resides here is not going to be happy to see us.  They never are. And it usually falls on me to get her out of it.  As she gains entry she stops for a moment and looks around.  I wish she’d move in a bit more, I can’t see anything.  She nods to herself, mumbling something I cannot hear. Finally taking a step forward I am able to cross the threshold with little resistance.  This was not good.

Spray paint adorns walls throughout the room we are in, not innocent vandalism, but images meant to trap something.  Images meant to cause whoever enters the room to be unable to leave said room. Shit. I’m stuck.  I see her leave this room, cross to the next and turn around. Looking right at me.  She doesn’t look happy, but she doesn’t look angry.

“Why are you following me?” she asked.

I cannot speak and I do not know how to convey that I am her protector. What I can do is see the horned beast materialize behind her, glaring directly at me.  I point over her shoulder but know it’s of no use, even if she looks she cannot see what is about to destroy her.  I run as fast as I can but once I hit the doorway I am stopped.  I am completely frozen, unable to move at all.  I know it’s over; for both of us.

“Talk!”  She commands. “ I want to know what you are!”
I am immobilized, I can’t move anything. I watch in horror as the beast approaches her, raising one giant claw.

“You’ve been fol…”

Her voice is halted as, with one swift strike, the gleaming red devil severs her head, killing her instantly.  I can only watch, still frozen, as her body crumples and I know I have failed.  This world is done for.

Damn.

I have no one I can trust, but I know that there has to be someone out there who can understand. This is my story.

I was a normal man, who lived a happy life. A good job, a happy family, a nice neighbourhood. It all changed.

It all changed.

I still vividly remember the day that crash happened. It was late at night, and I was returning home from work. The weather was misty and cold, and I couldn't see much ahead of the car. I reached an unexpected turn on a slippery road, and in the blink of an eye, my car was pinned into a tree.

Luckily, some travellers were present there, and called for help. I woke up in a hospital the next morning. My cuts and bruises hurt pretty badly, but it wasn't the physical injuries that made me uncomfortable. Something, no, everything felt just a little bit different.

I noticed it when my family came in to meet me. They were just as before, but there was something abnormal that I couldn't quite pinpoint. Maybe it was the increased conversations behind my back. Maybe it was the sinister look in their eyes. Or, maybe it was my imagination.

Soon after, I was back into my normal life. But, my suspicion did not leave me. It felt as if everyone I knew, even my wife and my children, were not themselves. It was as if they had been replaced by someone very, very similar.

This feeling kept me up every night. Frequent panic attacks and depression soon followed. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Of course, I knew that it was not the actual reality. It couldn't be. The 'Capgras Delusion', they called it.

Yesterday, everything changed. I had an intense panic attack. One so bad that I had to be taken to the hospital, where they tied me up to the bed.

I had calmed down after nearly six hours, when my wife, along with my six year old daughter, came to visit me. My wife left the room for a minute, and what my daughter said to me in that minute kept me screaming the entire night.

She smiled, came close to my ear, and, in her sweet voice, whispered, ""Do you _really_ think I am your daughter?""

This may be my last message. Now, the feeling has only gotten stronger. Everyone has started acting increasingly different.

And, every now and then, from the corner of my eye, I see someone or the other adjusting the skin on their face, almost like it was a mask.

Maybe, just maybe, it _is_ a mask.

Maybe, just maybe, it is _not_ a delusion.

The Capgras Delusion.

Red and brown and green. Red and brown and green. 

The lights continued to flash, shifting between each color in a matter of seconds. Repeating. Over and over again. I wondered if they were still plugged into the electrical system. 

Dad didn’t look back. He disappeared around the corner of the living room.

Silence. 

A second later, the lights were no longer flashing. They seemed to beam. He screamed. Then, he stopped. 

Heat rushed forward. Mom sobbed, crushing my baby sister against her chest and pulling me backwards through the kitchen. She begged me to move. But I felt like stone. I could only watch as the floor was charred black. It started melting. 

Then, the beam flickered. 

Flickered and switched to—

Blinking. Those familiar red-and-brown-and-green colors. 

Now joined by the color of bone.

a3kycc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a3kycc/she_was_taught_how_to_smile/,'She was taught how to smile',15,0,1544074056.0,"She was taught how to smile. Her mother told her that 'only beautiful girls know how to smile... and ugly girls do not'. She wanted to be beautiful. 

&nbsp;

And so she went. Smiling... even to the littlest of things, no matter what the consequence. She was kicked, punched, spat on... and hit and provoked otherwise in many different ways... but yet, she still managed to smile.

&nbsp;

She went to school. The children didn't like her. She tried to like the children.

&nbsp;

Her mother told her that 'only beautiful girls know how to have friends... and ugly girls do not'. She wanted to be beautiful. 

&nbsp;

But she found this odd.

&nbsp;

It was beginning to get like a fable now. So she felt, so she rose. Her colors became coated in a timid black... that became less timid as she grew.

&nbsp;

She was a teenager now. She knew how to smile... and she had friends... albeit a small amount... but it was there. Her hands felt numb.

&nbsp;

The girl remembered something... yet another thing.

&nbsp;

'Only beautiful girls know how to cry... and ugly girls do not'. She remembered crying... but it was a while ago. Her mother used to laugh... all the while watching her squirm like a caterpillar. 

&nbsp;

She wanted to be beautiful. 

&nbsp;

But she was already a butterfly of her own.

&nbsp;

It wasn't very far then. The roles soon became reversed... as her wings started to spread. It was beautiful in itself... as even when space started to distort around the girl... she still managed to feel clarity.

&nbsp;

A few days passed after this... which then became a few months... and many things happened throughout this time. Her spirit felt 'lighter'... her soul 'embraced'... and she developed to do things the way she had taught herself... which somewhat replaced the things of her past. 

&nbsp;

No longer was the butterfly tied down.

&nbsp;

Then came rain... but it was a slight drizzle. The clouds didn't express much emotion at that point... and neither did she. There was a deathly quiet.

&nbsp;

She felt strange... but she was still invited. It was a reunion of sorts... something she had never went to before prior... but one that she went to anyway. Many relatives were there... and they cried.

&nbsp;

She wondered if, they too... were beautiful.

&nbsp;
 
Regardless... the girl was still a teenager... and she wore a lovely, black dress, which matched the quaint umbrella that hung above her head in color. She didn't care much about the rain then... and she didn't care much about talking, either. She felt like she had talked enough... and instead, she chose to observe.

&nbsp;

It didn't last very long. The event was short-lived... yet, it lasted.

&nbsp;

And on that day... hidden between the shadows of both day and night... unrelinquished by what seemed to be no possible light of any sun or moon she would've ever known... her own beauty was there.

&nbsp;

And on that day of her mother's funeral... she grinned.

&nbsp;

'Good afternoon'.

&nbsp;

He had been very naughty this year you see and on this very night he is coming with me. 

He had pulled Juli’s hair and broke his mother’s dishes, he had even called his grandparents a couple of old bitches. 

He had been very rotten and spoiled no doubt, he is going to see what Krampus is all about. 

With the moonlight in my eyes and the look of dread on his face, he jumped out of bed and I began to give chase. 

He didn’t make it far before my hands on his neck did clasp, I whipped him and whipped him as he began to gasp,

“I’m sorry I was bad please stop this”, but I beat him some more because I was in pure bliss. 

I threw him in my basket like an old rag doll, and made my way to the window as he began to bawl. 

We rode in my sleigh til dawns early light, the boy had no idea he would be dinner tonight.

It stands, but it doesn’t stand alone. There are other snowmen scattered all over the neighborhood. 

Snowmen who stand and frown. Snowmen who suffer in silence. 

But snowmen who are also patient. 

Because they know that the sun will rise again. It will bring its light and the children will come back out to play. And then, the snowmen will steal more of their warmth. They’ll take and take and take until the living melt. 

Until they take their place.

a3bitg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a3bitg/a_german_tradition/,A German tradition,1341,64,1544009927.0,"In Germany we have a range of traditions that seem weird to other countries. We use fireworks on New Year's Eve to scare away the evil spirits of the old year. On Easter we burn stakes to drive out the winter demons. There are also dozens of local traditions in which people disguise themselves as witches, ghosts and demons for a variety of reasons. But few know the background of one of the strangest annual rituals we have.

The legend goes as follows: 1700 years ago a burglar broke into the house of a rich man. His attempt was interrupted by a guard. On his getaway he was badly injured and at the brink of death. At this point, his story would have ended and his name would have been long forgotten if it wasn't for a demon to show up. The demon offered him a bet. If the man could break into 10 houses of the nearby village until sunrise, the demon would give him another year on earth. But if one of the inhabitants raises the alarm, the demon would throw his soul into hellfire. The man, fearing for his life, accepted the bet. His wounds were healed and he set off.

He found 9 houses whose inhabitants were not at home. But as the first sunrays already gleamed over the horizon, he panicked and entered the next house on his way. He was already on the way out when the daughter of the family living there appeared in front of him. The man did not hesitate and cut her throat. Her blood colored his coat red.

He returned to the demon to claim his prize.

But he should have known, that demons don't play fair.

The blood of his innocent victim painting his clothes red until the end of time as a reminder of what he had done. And since the demon only gave him one additional year, the man is now doomed to gamble with the demon every year to save his soul from purgatory for another year.

Since then, he roams the earth.

As his story spread, people began to put their boots on the doorstep. They hoped that if the burglar knew that the inhabitants were at home, he would not enter their house. A pair of boots to keep the man out, who gambled with a demon for his soul.

Have you never heard of this man?

Times change and so do stories. Again and again over the centuries. In some versions of the story, he isn't a burglar, but a saint, in others, he's a warrior who fought a demon and won.

And with every change in the story, his name also changes. But don't get fooled. Even with a different name, he still is willing to murder innocent people to remain unseen.

European emigrants took his story over the Atlantic.

In Germany he is known as St. Nikolaus.

In North America, he has a new name.

Santa Claus."

By now, you have probably heard of the green light ritual. If you have not, I am sure that you will want to try it. It is simple enough, I promise. Make sure every door in your abode is unlocked, and remove all white sage. This will not work if white sage is on the premise. 

In an open space, draw a red cross on the floor. On the red cross, place a candle. Turn off all other lights. Light it before 3AM, at the same time saying ""I, \[Your Given Birth Name\] light this for you"". At 3AM precisely, blow out the candle and simply say ""I call you forward"". The candle should re-light itself, now bright green. 

It is possible you have heard to carry the ritual out within a ring of salt. That is unnecessary. Do not take this step. 

Let the green light burn. You will feel a presence watching you. Ignore it. There is nothing there. To complete the ritual, look at yourself in the mirror and simply say ""I accept you"". 

For those brave enough, a green light will not be your only reward. I completed this ritual last night. To write out what happened next is a disservice to each and everyone of you. Remember, no white sage or salt. You will always be safe during this ritual. I promise. "

It feels strange knowing that I’m sick, that my mind is playing tricks on me, but going through with this all the same. 

Thousands of others have already done it. Refused to keep on living with the uncertainty of whether they were one or the other. 

If it’s true what they say, that there’s a beat in all machines, then it doesn’t seem to be any different than a human pulse. 

When they first started to mass produce synthetics, all the well known risks were addressed. Asimov’s laws and all that. It was illegal to program a robot with knowledge of shooting guns or wielding knives. 

It was relatively easy being around the artificials in the beginning. They didn’t act like real humans. Their movements were wobbly and clumsy and their AI underdeveloped. Teaching a robot a new trick was like teaching a toddler to play chess. But then progress set in, and the revolutionary new tech slowly became harder and harder to distinguish from an actual human. And when they started making each one unique in appearance and personality things started to go downhill. 

There had always been groups opposed to the advancements in robotics and AI, but the paranoia that followed when people realized they couldn’t tell skinjobs and real flesh and blood people apart, gave these groups traction far beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. 

Pretty soon robots were hunted like animals and their hardwiring of Asimov’s laws prevented them from fighting back. Not that they had much of a chance anyway. Most of them were executed in the streets, bullet to the head before they even saw their assailants approaching. 

But it wasn’t long before people starting turning up dead too. Gunned down by the anti-synth groups, who, like the rest of the population, couldn’t tell one apart from the other. 

And then Young-Syndrome reared it’s ugly head. A mental disease that spread through the population like wildfire. And the disease that’s responsible for me sitting here with a gun in my mouth, doubting whether I was born or built. 

So many are gone now, humans and robots alike, and all the fear mongering leading up to the creation of the first robots and the first AI made us lose sight of the real danger. Not the logical fallacies of synthetic people but the frailty of the mind. 

The gun tastes bad, but I don’t know if it means that I have tastebuds or protocols telling me what to taste. Either way, I don’t think this is going to hurt much. "

I cant help but think about how this amazing woman has for the past ten years made this time of the year special to all of her nieces and nephews. She would bring us gifts and was an amazing cook. She was as sweet as apple pie and happy as the day is long. She hadn’t always been that way,  she  had a family of her own but ten years ago that all changed 

Ralph was her husband and they had a boy named Josh. Ralph spoiled Josh so much that he could get away with anything. All of us hated when he came to visit, even our grandparents. They tried to talk to Ralph and June about how rotten he was but June couldn’t say a cross word or punish the boy or Ralph would punish her and Ralph , well how would just say” he is just misunderstood”. Josh would often hit June and scream at her if he didn’t get his way. Like I said he was a holy terror 

Three weeks before Christmas Ralph had gotten into a car accident and had died. That had left poor aunt June to raise the boy on her own. His attitude had gotten worse and he kept threatening to run away and a few days before Christmas he made good on that threat. Aunt June filed the missing persons reports and informed the family, but she seemed almost relieved and went as far as telling the family that Christmas Dinner will be at her house this year. We just assumed she was in shock but we agreed

On Christmas Day we gathered at aunt June’s house where she had prepared a feast of turkey, dressing, ham, bbq pulled pork and all the fixings. Not hardly a word was uttered about Ralph and Josh, she was the happiest I had ever seen her and up until the day she died, she remained like that a very happy carefree lady. Josh is still missing and I figured after ten years he is gone and wont be coming back

One thing I had begged aunt June to cook for years was that bbq pulled pork again, I had never had any that good before or since the pork tasted different and was so much better than most and I asked her so many times why she wouldn’t make it again and she would just reply “ It was a special meal for just that one special time.” Now that I think about it bbq is an odd thing to have for Christmas dinner but it was so delici…..oh my God….I know what happened to Josh."

Shaking off the bad memories, she let the old worn out suitcase down to the ground. It appeared out of nowhere on her porch.   
Another wind swirled, a flash of lightning followed by a booming thunder. The door that was hanging loosely on its hinges burst open but somehow remained there, not giving up.  
Her attention turned to the suitcase and knelt down on the dirty ground. There was no number lock. She pressed her thumbs on either side of the handle and with a click, it opened. Slowly and carefully, she parted the suitcase, expecting something to jump out at her.   
With the shitty weather and appearance of the dimly lit room, she is already scared shitless.   
Fortunately, nothing attacked her. It was just a piece of paper that looks like it has been ripped out of a notebook. She reached out and grab the paper. It was a list of names. Her face became a deathly pale white.  
~~Sharon~~  
~~Celia~~  
Lauren.

The paper slips off from her shaky fingers. Heart racing, she jumps back to her feet. The light flickered and died, leaving her in complete darkness.

I had already broken so many rule’s, made so many mistakes, and though I knew it forbidden I touched her. 

She was beautiful, long golden curls graced her ivory skin, faded brown freckles kissed the bridge of her nose, perfection nearly failed to describe her. She winced at my touch, a cold breath of air escaping her lips as i recoiled, sliding myself beneath my cloak to allow the darkness to swallow me as i watched her stir.

She opened her eyes, a tiny yawn escaping her as she looked around the room. Those ocean hues steadied on me, my breath caught in my throat for a moment, I had forgotten yet another rule. I swayed forward as she began to speak, “I remember you...” I bent down to her, studying that soft face as her bell of a voice filled the air. “Yeah?” 

She nodded, golden curls falling in tufts over her face as her smile slowly turned to a frown. “This time I...I have to go don’t I.” Her words stuck like a knife in my heart, as i choked back the tears ever ready to fall. “Yes.” She sighed softly, slowly raising to stand looking up at me as she wrapped her tiny hand around my fingers. “I know..I will be ok if it’s you who takes me.” 

I choked the tears once more, as we slowly turned “Yes.” I whispered softly, we started the long dark journey towards the ever light this time I would lead her all the way through the light. She stopped for but a moment, looking up at me with those big blue’s “how come this time I could see you?”

Another anonymous noise complaint from the old man in the flat next door. What I had I done this time? Had telly on a fraction too loud for his liking? Laughed at a funny moment in the comedy I was watching? It didn’t matter, there was always something. 


I’m not a noisy person. I try to be considerate and I care about my reputation in the building. I never make undue noise after 10pm, I have no wild parties, I wear headphones when playing computer games. But yet somehow I made too much noise for the old man next door.  


Not that he ever told me, mind you, he always smiled and said hello when I met him on the stairs. I had asked him to let me know if I was bothering him and he said I never did. And yet. Thump-thump-thump as he brandished his cane against my wall nightly. Once because of a nightmare when I woke with a scream, once because I had dropped a cup of tea, once simply because I had flushed my toilet after midnight. I couldn’t live like this. I tried not to care, but every thump-thump-thump made my heart sink and my soul despair. 


I had had enough. And after the last thump-thump-thump on my wall I decided to do something about it. A dark night hides many sins. A lock pick opened his feeble lock, a pillow over his face muffled his startled scream and then stopped his breathing for good. I removed the pillow and left his flat with a last hateful glance at his cane, right next to his bed, handy for thumping against the wall. But no more. Never again.


I went to stay with my parents after that. I couldn’t bear staying there, knowing that there was a dead man next door. A dead man. A man I had killed. And afraid that they would know it was me once he was found. But when I went home after a week, it was all over. The old man’s body had been taken way. Died in his sleep, heart attack, another neighbour told me. “Hardly surprising, he was 86,” she added. It seemed a miracle, but I had got away with murder.


I felt as if I had been released from prison. While I cooked I listened to the radio and sang along with the songs I liked. I watched telly as loudly as I wanted, which was not very loud at all. I laughed out loud several times, not because the programme was so funny, but because I was happy. I was free. 


Night fell and I went to bed only to wake at 2 am. The moonlight streamed in through my window. I reached out for the glass of water on my night stand; it fell and clattered along the floor. And from somewhere close by there was an answer: thump-thump-thump.

Dad never talked about our mothers, and we knew better than to ask. 

I'll never forget how he told me. He led me down to the basement (a room which we were warned never to enter under any circumstances), and we stood before a table hiding something lumpy under a cloth. Dad reached under the cloth and pulled out a woman's head. ""Now Cassie, this was your mother."" He thrust the preserved head in my face ""Do you see how similar you two look?

It wasn’t fair I still had a life to live and I didn’t do anything wrong. I just went for a walk like I normally do in the mornings. He just wouldn’t let go, after I felt his fingers his cold hands grip my arms to bring me closer to him. I feel like one of the stupid people in the horror movie who didn’t know their life was coming to an end. He brought my face closer to his I had to shut my eyes so I didn’t see the horrors that lie beneath his wicked smile. I could feel my knees weaken, my heart race faster than it’s ever gone, and my stomach doing somersaults.   
	I could feel his breath on my ear as he whispered, “Why are you so scared it’s not like I’m going to hurt you.” I knew at that moment I didn’t want to lose my life I struggled at first but then I was able to kick him down.

He attacked me, I only did what was right, right?*” They couldn’t stand talking to me since no one could stay in the same room as me.

I, the Author. The Creator.


And you, you flock of sheep, you tender herd. You, who read and reinvent; who make fact that which I have made fiction. For do the great characters and creations of our authors not linger with us until death? Do they not impact us in very real ways? Are we not bolstered by stories of heroes, taught lesson by fable? Do we not shiver, not from cold but from fright, hours...days...years after the horror has been told to us? 


You see, in the re-imagining, in the remembering, it becomes real all over again...


How unfortunate for you to have come to this place. To be reading these words. I would urge to you stop, to read no further, but you would never heed it. You would tell yourself that this is just a story. There is no way it could be real.


And you are right. The tale of Mister Sweet Dreams makes little sense under scrutiny. His story and background change with each telling of the tale. I wrote no less than five different versions before scrapping them entirely.


What you will remember are the long bony fingers that have been sharpened to points; the jagged and broken and rotting mouth; those...eyes; and the ugly sloughing of his festering skin, for Mister Sweet Dreams wears tattered rags that leave little to the imagination.


But, that is exactly my trick. I leave it all to your imagination.


And in doing so, I have not cursed you with MY Mister Sweet Dreams. I have gifted you a horror of your own making.


And when I then tie that image, that horrible image I have made you conjure to your other senses--when I tell you that Mister Sweet Dreams comes at night, when you’re in that place between awake and asleep, where your thoughts begin taking on physical form; when I tell you that you’ll hear the creak of a bedspring or a door-hinge, or maybe a bump you'll tell yourself is the neighbors or the house settling; when I tell you that you’ll smell a familiar spice, not unpleasant, but that reminds you of the cold, harsh months; when, despite the warmth of your bed and the gentleness of your thoughts as you drift to sleep, the hairs on your arm and neck stand at end and you begin shivering--you’ll make your Mister Sweet Dreams all the more real.


Do you know the most terrifying thing about Mister Sweet Dreams? 


I never said what he does when he comes to you.


But you...know...


Because I have created. And you have created. And together, we have made something that will haunt you in that in-between. Not every night. Not most nights. But some nights. And that’s enough for Mister...

“I won’t knock.”

&#x200B;

She always was the paranoid type.  Everything’s a danger.  Even in the safest neighbourhood in Canada, there’s always a creep somewhere hiding behind a lamppost.  Sometimes, there’s even a monster, and it really makes me wonder if she's serious.

&#x200B;

It was a simple errand.  Take the trash to the curb.  A task taking no more than 5 minutes.

&#x200B;

A bag of garbage in tow, the girl opened the door and stepped out into the cool night.  With a hushed thud, the door closed, and no sooner the locked turned.  I was alone in the house.

&#x200B;

As I turned around to return to cooking, I heard a knock against the door behind me.  As I reached for the lock, I remembered.  *I won’t knock*.  I paused.  A pound.  Another.

&#x200B;

Each second that passed, another, more frantic hit landed, shaking the door.  As I stepped back, I heard a faint voice.

&#x200B;

“L-let me in!  Help!”

&#x200B;

It was her voice, yet not so. Something felt wrong about it.  Each cry seemed to reverberate, a hollow, distorted echo trailing just a moment behind every spoken word.

&#x200B;

It began kicking.  Whatever was out there, it was even scratching.  Then, the lock began to turn.  I stumbled backwards as the door opened.  Hailey stood there, confused,

&#x200B;

“What are you doing on the floor?  Are you okay?”

&#x200B;

I glanced at her, exactly the same girl as the one who stepped out.  The door too, now open for me to see, was unscratched, untouched in anyway.

&#x200B;

I looked in utter disbelief as I saw my best friend Bob Robertson sitting down on my kitchen table. Oh not because he was sitting down at my table.  He’d always done that, and my house was always open to him. No, it was the fact that he was a ghost that was currently freaking me out.

“B.b...but Bob, you’re dead.”

Admittedly, my response could have been better. But you have to admit, seeing an actual honest-to-God ghost does do things to a man.

Bob just simply looked down at his semi-translucent body, floating mere centimeters off the chair. “Huh, reckon i am.”

“But how? How are you a ghost? Why are you a ghost?” The questions started pouring out, finally breaking through the mental dam. “Why are you here, in my house, days after your funeral?”

Bob rubbed the back of his head rather sheepishly. “Guess it’s cause i want one of your peanut butter and jelly sandwich? You’ve always made them the best.”

For a moment, my mind raced with more questions. Is there a proven afterlife? Are there more ghosts besides Bob? How does one become a ghost. Then I stopped. Like always, I was thinking way too hard about this. 

My best friend was here, sitting in my kitchen, wanting to spend some time with me. I couldn’t help but smile. “Sure, Bob. Just give me a few minutes to make it.” I started heading towards  the kitchen, before stopping and turning around. “Any particular kind of jelly?”

For a moment, I was afraid that Bob would suddenly not be there. That it had all been a figment of my imagination. But Bob was still there. Still smiling at me with a smile only an honest soul could give. “Strawberry.”

I broke out into a grin as I turned towards the cupboard.. “Sure, I’ve got that.”

Three sharp notes, painful to the ear, and a pause, and then again and again and again. For sixty heartbeats she stands there listening, dripping rag still clutched in white fisted grip, pan still half submerged in suds and steaming water, waiting to wake up.

A gentle hand tugs her shirt, and a young voice, questioning, reaches her deafened ears. ""What is it?"" her little boy asks, piping tones pitched to curiosity ""can we go and see?""

There is no fear there, not yet, and she is more grateful for that than she can say.

There is no shelter, she knows; there was talk, perhaps, about building one by the old factory, but that was years and years ago, and nothing ever came of it. The money was never there (and when it was, the local politicians came to the common agreement that it would be better spent on the new turf field near the local high school; she remembers hearing her neighbours talking about it).

The old advice comes back to her, fragments of guidance that they had learned in school from poorly budgeted informational videos; *citizens far from an available shelter should hide beneath a desk or table or chair, or in a doorway, or in the basement, or under the stairs.*

*Find somewhere safe* she remembers those faceless instructors saying, in their bland tones. Useless advice-- she knows it's useless because the sirens are blaring those three piercing notes and nowhere is safe.

She hangs the dripping rag over the faucet, leaves the dishes where they lie and crouches down and gathers her boy, her bright, curious boy who's still asking questions she can't possibly answer, into her arms. She pressed her face against his soft hair. She does not cry, because then he would know that everything is wrong. her voice does not shake, because then he might know that she is grieving. 

She whispers to him as they wait, in the brief silences between the shrieks. tenderly, softly, with all the joy and sadness of the world: *I love you.*

In a maximum-security prison, filled with murderers and rapists, the worst thing they can do to you is leave you completely alone. Solitary confinement.

The human brain needs input, or it quickly descends into horrifying madness of its own company.

In 2086 when the world government fell into a dictatorship, capital punishment became very common. However, it was solitary confinement that people feared. That was reserved just for treason.

I spent my working life making the solitary confinement cells and carrying out the confinement. Here’s how it works.

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

The cells are molded to exactly fit the condemned. They are human shaped coffins. Arms out to the side at 30**°,** legs 45**°** apart. For the insertion process the traitors are sedated.

The eyes, ears and mouth are not damaged, but all are sealed permanently shut. An automated breathing tube inserted through the throat.  Three IV lines are inserted to feed nutrients, we use three lines in case of mechanical failure on one. Catheters are inserted to handle waste.

The condemned are sealed in and buried in the very public, traitors’ graveyard. With enough autonomous supplies to last 80 years, but to be considered dead from that day.

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

Nasty right?

Well that has been my job for the last 20 years, and I am pretty numb to the idea of it. One person a day entered the traitors’ graveyard. This was so that the condemned persons story could feature on the evening news. Along with their frenzied begging for a pardon. It hasn’t caused me distress in many years.

&#x200B;

That was until last week, when I was convicted of treason.

&#x200B;

I can’t really argue, I’m guilty. But after seeing the things I have seen, is it surprising I turned to murder. This regime needs to be brought down, this barbaric practice of solitary confinement needs to end now!

But it will take a better man than me to achieve that.

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

Today I woke up from the sedation. My eyes and mouth sealed shut. Deafening silence and dazzling blackness greet my panicked brain. Fight or flight response kicks in and I choose between 0 options.

I can’t move an inch, even my fingers are molded in place.

I just keeping thinking about all those people I put down here, all the things I wish I had done differently.

I can’t have been down here for more than a week and I would choose death if I could.

&#x200B;

I would give anything to take back the treason I committed. The 7,000 people I killed.

I only did it to save others from untold suffering. I did it while they were sedated. A syringe of air into their veins to cause cardiac arrest. One murder each day for 20 years.

It’s just me alive down here, living the life of a traitor."

I saw him the first time when I was a kid. His body was like a liquid shadow poured into human form. Only his eyes stood out unnaturally white from the place where a face should be. And his crooked grin revealed a series of needle-like teeth.

I was young and thought the adults would not believe me. So I shared the secret with my cat Kitty.

The second time I saw him when I was a teenager. Again those eyes staring at me. That scary grin as he chewed on my cat's intestines and chomped it with relish.

I told my mother about it, but she thought it was just a scary imagination to cope with the loss.

The third time I saw him, his long, bony hands stuck in the guts of my mother as she lay in a pool of blood in the street.

I told my dad about it, but he thought I was traumatized because I had witnessed the car accident.

The third time I saw him, he was kneeling in my father's blood, which was flowing from a gaping wound on his thoat. Again this irritating grin.

I told my fiancé about it, but she thought I was just insane.

Then I saw him as he closed his bony fingers orund my fiance's throat. Out of her eyes spoke panic, out of his spoke sadistic joy.

The Four inside were deep a-slumber, themselves quite exhausted from the toils of their path. Thankful for quiet fare, the simple coachman sat nobly - as noble as a deaf & blind man can sit, at least. He hummed out of tune to his team in front, clopping along dutifully. 

Only the occasional crunch of frosted leaves below signaled the haunting approach of winter’s beastly presence. The coachman neither feared nor appreciated the cold, he simply knew it. And adapted to it. He could no sooner impede its annual mauling of the deciduous greens, as halt its retreat into the ether, when spring comes to bear. *“Winter, winters”*, he would often say. *“As a coachman, coaches”*. 

From the other side of a grass-less gulley, a lone wolf howled solemnly against the full moon, a primeval cry for something - perhaps food, his family, or his mate. Throughout the ink-dipped forest, similar wails could be heard, if only there was a soul that could hear. Sparrows sang cautiously to their nests, as if the right notes might keep tonight’s predators at bay. A cougar, her voice hoarse and teeming with carnivorous malice, snarled deeply into the wind as she searched for a lost cub. 

The coachman drove on, nodding peacefully behind a black sleeping-mask. He could have been sleeping indeed, and not one would have been the wiser. His tasks simple, he did not mind the night runs that the carriage demanded. He counted every blessing, knowing that he truly was so very blessed. Was he paid richly? Perhaps not, but what is money? Some paper and gold; carnal stuff. Were his trips lively and brimming with companionship? Well, no, *“but what of it?“* he undoubtedly would question. He had a job, and he was good at his job. 

“Whoa, there, whoa!” The Coachman masterfully slowed his team to a stop, a small hamlet of houses and steeples and barns up ahead. *“Arrival at last, and not a moment too soon I’m sure”*, he dropped his head with a sigh. 

“Here!” The coachman rapped a bony white knuckle on the cold metal of the stragecoach. 

Without a whisper, the Four passengers left for the town. The coachman waited. 

On that night, as on every night, he quietly thanked God for his blessings: a solid occupation, a warm coat, and ears that heard no screams. "

You are the scum, the lower one, the harbinger of sin. Good will always prevail. You already know this truth. Yet, we stand here since time immemorial. Just give up.""

God was taken aback. He could see the Devil's true form clearly. He did not underestimate Satan. He knew what power was on the other side.

Not just any darkness―like the soft, feathery darkness of night that litters the grass with dew and starlight.  This darkness was heavy, thick, and viscous like tar.  Light was stifled, sound was suffocated, and smell became faint.  The  unending darkness was enough to drive half the population mad.  But that was not the true horror.

Some amount of time after the first wave of darkness brought them.  Light petered out, but their wide smiles cut through  the darkness like a scalpel.  We didn't understand what it was―huddled close together in a church sanctuary―but the chill frightened us.  Once the darkness overlaid everything, temperature seemed to cease to exist―but the smiles brought a frigidness that bit us to the bone.

It was rather ironic, how we found our salvation.  One of the group―I don't remember who―began humming a hymn, eyes screwed shut and hands clasped, praying to our God.  The grin―cutting through the void―stopped moving.  It didn't move forwards or backwards, just standing behind the stained-glass window, waiting. 

Our pastor joined in―a wavering voice to add to the humming.  Then others joined.  Each voice that joined in seemed to push the smile further.  Finally, the group of us―a moderately sized choir group of avid churchgoers―belting out a hymn like there was no tomorrow.  The smile moved far, far away―so far that it could barely be recognized.  But like a small sliver of the moon, it stayed visible.

After an hour or so of an unending stream of hymns and psalms, people's voices began to break.  The ones who had stronger voices kept on, as the weaker voices began scrambling around the church, grabbing their collected food cans and anything else that would help them feel just the slightest bit safer.

As people re-congregated in the sanctuary, a scream outside the church broke through the singing, causing the choir to pause.  With this pause, the now multiple grins began creeping forwards once again.  They moved slowly, and the choir jumped back into their song―but it was significantly weaker than previously.

Imagine, the endless darkness, the hellish grins, and from our point of view, the last group of people alive on earth.  People began switching in and out, filling spaces in so we could eat and drink.  The song had to outlive the darkness, but it was clear to most that we wouldn't survive if we stayed here.  More than half wished to stay, so a portion of people left, singing like a group of wintertime carolers in this cold new reality.

Imagine, watching the overflowing amount of food begin to be eaten, as less and less people had the voice to sing.  The smiles, always watching, always barely in view, shining through the stained-glass window.  I had a stronger voice than most, but even I had to break off for a short time.  Time passed, and we switched in and out―praying, singing, and eating.

Then, after everyone else was tired and hurting, imagine being the last singer with a voice, forcing out note after note through your throat―red and stripped of skin.  Imagine, as the songs got quieter and quieter, the smiles slowly moved closer.  There were perhaps a hundred, by this point, but I still tried.

Imagine the fear I felt, when I turned to look backwards, and found that the rest of them had abandoned me."

I could just barely make out it's eyes: they were a dimly glowing blue, moving back and fourth as if they were observing me. The rest of it was covered in shadow, impossible to see.

After I panicked for maybe, a minute or so, I realized I was going under sleep paralysis. I remembered a few traces of a dream I had before I ""woke up"", so there was no doubt.

I just waited there, staring at the strange shadow for a bit, waiting for my body to adjust and wake up.

I waited for quite a bit.

The sun started to shine through the window, filling the room with light. But somehow, the silhouette remained dark. I must've woken up close to sunrise.

Through the thicket and the brambles,
Through the ferns and the branches,
Through the growth and the bushes,
Came that stranger wandering.

Past the mountains of mist,
‘Neath the colonies of jays and magpies,
Past the chilled riverlands,
‘Neath great masses of cloud,
Wandered the stranger.

He came bearing the sigil of the Lishthar,
Wearing their robes,
Woven as a thread among their tapestry,
Washed with unrestrained glee upon his face.

He heralded tales to share,
Of deathly dances with the unknown,
Of demonic rites with the blasphemous,
Of diabolical seances committed beneath the visage of night.

He came bearing the words of his lord,
Preaching the prophet’s tellings,
Preaching the sermons of Leira and her kin,
Preaching the utterances of the nameless one.

Lodging he was given,
For this land knows the lord,
And assists his messengers.
For this land is one of hospitality,
And one where no man, be they drunkard or king, is refused.

In the night,
The winds whirred,
The crows cawed,
And the wolves bayed.


Through the firmament,
Past the cosmos,
Through the lands of the dead,
Past the mist-ridden mountains,
Came but one sound,
Came but one resounding cry.

It whispered eerily,
It droned uncannily,
It moaned drearily,
It wailed fitfully.

It warped villager’s sleepy thoughts,
It tainted scholar’s dreams,
It polluted artisan’s abstractions,
It contaminated bard’s hallucinations.

With a voice like an icy chill it spoke,
With a song of malicious concert it entertained,
Whispering no chorus or siren call,
Wallowing in no ancient terror.

It instead whispered through the minds of the sensitive,
It instead filled the thoughts of the young and the old
With but one simple proclamation:

“Thy days they end,
Thy name the wind will erase,
Thy legacy the world shall forget.

For I hath come,
For I hath roamed here,
For I hath taken.

I am death,
I am the multitude,
I am the spectral,
And I hath come.”

With the coming of daybreak,
With the coming of the sun,
With the coming of the blue sky,
With the coming of the dawning autumnal glare,

No swineherd rose from their bed,
No artisan awakened to their pieces,
No scholar returned to their work,
No bard stringed at their lute.

All the while,
A man, bearing the sigil of Lishthar,
A creature, gowned in the silken robes of her order,
A beast, awash with unrestrained glee,

Walked patiently through dead streets,
Paced quietly through still woodlands,
Paced aimlessly through forested terrain,
Powered confidently through the dense undergrowth, his work done.

And still the wind whispers,
And still nature drones,
And still the cosmos cry,

Uttering but these simple, drear words:

“I am death,
I am the multitude,
I am the spectral,
And I hath come,
And I hath gone.”"

Sally picked up her heavy school bag and made her way towards the school exit. Well at least she tried to get there. Her walk turned into a jog and the jog into a run. Finally she stopped. The exit hasn’t come any closer, but she was sure that she should’ve reached it by now. She looked around, but the hallway looked normal, with doors to classrooms and other “not classroom” rooms. She tried to open one. Locked. All the doors she tried to open were locked.

Her mind felt dizzy and her knees began to tremble. She walked towards the exit again, this time making sure that she was actually covering distance. The floor seemed to be moving and her steps were real. She walked for about 30 seconds and was sure, that the exit must be right in front of her. She looked up again. The exit wasn’t an inch closer than before.

She began to cry. Sally usually is a brave girl. Fearless you could say. Once last year, 2nd grade that was, she was the only student in her class who was not afraid of the spider her teacher brought to school. She even picked it up and played with it. It felt hairy, sure, and she was nervous first, but as soon as she understood that the spider actually was harmless, the fear just vanished. But this feeling is different. It’s as if her body was covered in spiders but she is not able to get rid of them. She removes one, two, three but they just made their way up to her again.

She panicked. “Hello, anyone here?” she shouted at the top of her lungs. No response. “Please anyone ...”, she sobbed again. Finally the exit door swung open. A thin figure was standing there. It was holding a trident. A wave of small, crawling creatures slowly filled floor and ceiling. She couldn’t escape. Now she understood where she was."

The torches burn. The halls of this fortress seem infinite. Hunger eats my insides. Thirst parches my throat. How many days have I wandered through this infernal stone labyrinth?

I don't want to die. Not like this. Not now. No condemned boy or girl ever foresaw this kind of death. No one intends to die alone in a labyrinth devoid of any sane souls. However, I hear there is worse fate here.... 

Flickering torches light the way. There are long stretches of halls, filled with blinding darkness. I dare not go there. Exit or no, I refuse to be consumed by the abyss, yet I fear being seen by the torchlight. What can see me is most certainly not pleasant.

How many days? One? Half? Three days? Have I been walking in circles? No matter. I will die. If not the demon, my thirst. I grow weak. I slump against a cool, dry wall. This will be a good place to perish. I close my eyes. I want this black dream to die along with me.


*CLUNK* *CLUNK*


Unfortunately, I wake once more.


*CLUNK* *CLUNK*


No. Not the beast.


*CLUNK* *CLUNK*


The unmistakable sound of heavy hooves. An enormous mass of flesh turns at the corner. Black eyes glimmer in the torchlight. Sharp demonic horns pierce the darkness. Its arms gloved in virgin blood. The creature's broad chest heaves. Its muzzle sniffs for life. The half-bull's thick, slimy tongue tastes the air for young flesh. The Minotaur is upon me.

Hermes be with me! With olympic speed, I flee from it. I try to flee from it all. Promptly, hooves clop wildly behind me. My soles ache, yet I run across these twisting halls. The beast is behind me. I feel its burning breath. I hear its clopping sprint. 

A stretch of darkness! Please! Let me hide! I’m almost there!

The beast seizes me with both hands. It lifts me. Its fingers dig into my back. Blood trickles down my legs. It opens its cavernous mouth. Hot, sanguine air escapes it. My arm crunches between its teeth. I shriek in pain. It chews slowly. I look at the dark-red stump that was once my arm. Dizziness. A blunt headache strikes me. My stomach squelches. The demon opens its mouth once more, and my head goes inside. 

Oh, Half-Bull of Minos, damn you to the deepest depths of Hades."

It was her own personal skydive, her little adrenaline rush every night. She grinned in anticipation as she pulled up her blankets, closed her eyes, and got comfortable.

After about half an hour, she felt that falling sensation. Falling... falling...

Falling.

Falling.

This was going on for a long time. When would she start dreaming? Was this a dream? It was possible.

But Amelia could still move around. She could still faintly feel the bed underneath her, as if she were a ghost. She held her arms. They were solid, still there. She wasn't dreaming.

So why couldn't she open her eyes? *WHY COULDN'T SHE OPEN HER EYES?*

Hours, days, months passed. She was still falling, holding herself, feeling her limbs get thinner, and weaker. She would hear whispers on the edge of her hearing, gone before she could comprehend what they were saying.

Her scream didn't echo in the abyss."

My partner took two rounds in the chest and smashed backwards into a freezer door. I sprinted out the back, losing the cash and twisting my ankle in the process. I could already hear the sirens closing in.

I wasn’t going to jail. That was for sure. I was gonna end it all, either with my own gun or in a shootout with the cops. 

The sirens were almost on top of me now. I made a decision, putting the barrel to my head and closing my eyes. 

Then I heard the voice. 

“I can help you,” it said in my head. “For a price.” 

It was simple, really. I just listened to the voice. 

The voice guided me, somehow always leading me a step ahead of the sirens. Finally, I was in front of my apartment building. 

“Now”, the voice said. “The price.” 

A homeless man lay sleeping next to the front steps. I don’t even know how the knife got into my pocket. 

Later, I stumbled up to my apartment. Laurie was in there, and jumped at the sight of blood staining my clothes. I shushed her, worrying she’d wake the baby. When she asked if I got the money, I reached into my pocket and found the robbery cash in there, somehow retrieved from the floor of the store where I had lost it. Rent was paid for another month.

Time passed. Money was tight again, and Laurie complained there wouldn’t be enough room for us and Luke when he grew too large to sleep in the crib. I knew she was right, but it wasn’t my fault I couldn’t find work. 

I was walking home from the bar one night when I heard the voice again.

“I can help you, for a price.” 

The young couple was kissing quietly on a bench in the park, oblivious to the world. A perfect spot, where this late at night no one else would be around.

He was first. There was no knife in my pocket this time, but I didn’t need it. She was next, had tried to run but didn’t make it far.
 
He must have been rich. The engagement ring in his pocket was worth more than I had made in my entire life. 

Laurie, Luke and I moved into a bigger apartment. Things were easy, happy. Laurie didn’t ask where the money was coming from, and I didn’t tell her. 

I thought it would have been enough. A nice apartment, a nice family. 

But it wasn’t enough. 

I came home every day and saw what wasn’t there. A bigger tv. A nicer kitchen. A fancier car. A prettier wife. 

And the voice was back. It showed me things. Mansions, cars, women. Anything I could dream of.

All I have to do is pay the price. 

Laurie’s out for the night. I have the place to myself.

Just me… and Luke."

I don't know what circumstances brought you to me or made us cross paths. I can't pass judgement on you in any way, outside of knowing what you have tried to do to me.

I don't like bullies.

Drug withdrawal is painful, and heroin is the worst. You get sick, you shake and everything hurts. You hallucinate and you wish that you were dead; like you do now. But death would be too good for you. You tried to steal from me and tell lies about me. You tried to take advantage of me when I was at my most vulnerable, and now, I'm going to make you wish that you were dead.

There's no need for a blindfold; I want you to know that it's me who is doing this to you. Want you to look into my eyes so I can see your agony and know that it's me who is causing it. And besides, I've already told you that if you try to close your eyes, I'll cut your eyelids off and manually moisten your eyeballs. Nothing would give me more pleasure. But so far, you've complied. You know that I'm not joking. The pleasure I receive from your suffering is viable. 

I'm a smart girl, so I can keep you in good nutritional order. A few google searches and a few more illicit turns on the deep web and I could get every IV I needed to make sure that you wouldn't die, so you know that if you're going to refuse food and drink it doesn't matter. I don't need you to eat.

I fill the needle just so. I've already cooked it up, and I know that it's been long enough that you're starting to come out of the other side of it. And so, it begins. I find our favourite vein, and I slowly plunge the needle into your skin. Pressing down the plunger I feel the excitement rising within me. What's better is the horror in your eyes- you know I'm going to get you addicted again, and you know that for a while you'll be in paradise, rotting away in my grotty basement. And nobody cares. Nobody is going to look for a nasty little troll who tries to hurt people. I'm sure most of them are glad to turn a blind eye for sheer relief at your disappearance. 

You're trying to fight back now. Trying to flair around and scream, but I know how to bind and gag someone effectively; I did my homework. So now all that's left is for me to pull up my chair and watch. Watch you become hooked again and again, and watch the agony of your withdrawal again and again.

There's nothing I'd rather be doing with my evenings.

She lived on the 7th floor and used to go home late, because she was working on her thesis and her school was a bit far from her place. The story goes that everytime she would take the elevator, it would stall on the fourth floor. The slide doors wouldn't open or anything, but there'd be this feeling of pressure on the elevator, as if someone were to step in and join her.

Do you know the feeling of having someone stand next to you and stare at you, even though you couldn't see them? Apparently, this would happen to her each time. In fact, it got so bad that one particular night, she asked her mother if she could wait for her in the lobby and accompany her upstairs. Her mom, of course, agreed.

The girl arrived home later than usual that night, say around, 3am. Thankfully, her mother was at the lobby, waiting for her like she promised. They entered the elevator together, and when the elevator paused on the fourth floor, the girl looked at her mother and said, ""See what I mean? It always happens!""

The older woman, in an effort to comfort her daughter, wrapped an arm around her shoulder and leaned in, right before whispering, ""Do I really look like your mother?"""

Let’s start from the beginning, when I was three years old my family moved house. It was small on the outside but on the inside, it was massive.I loved all the space to run around, places to hide while playing hide and seek,it was amazing. Was. 

My parents would tell me that I would wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming bloody murder. They ran. They ran in fear. Fear that some man was there watching me sleep. Or trying to break in. Wreaking havoc on my tiny, helpless mind. But when they ran into my room, I was fine. In the same position they left me. 

Weeks later they would be putting me in the bath or changing my clothes and would find dozens of tiny scratches. Years it would be like this. Blood curdling screams then silence, only to find scratches later. They went to the doctor multiple times, but they would put it down to me exploring the house and scratching myself on the corners. 

That still didn’t explain the screaming. They had never heard anything like it. It wasn’t just tantrum wailing, it was like an adult was screaming, not because of the way it sounded but the way it was so loud. They found it unbelievable a baby could cry that loud. 

My mother was getting hysterical. Constantly tired. Running around trying to calm my screeches took a toll on her mental health. 

As time went by it started to stop and the scratches faded.  We were normal again. Sane.

I was a teenager. The sun went down. A time I dread now. The sunset. A view people love but I have grown to hate. 

A  flash of black ran past me. Until it just stopped. Not stopped and vanished. Stopped in front of me. A silhouette. 

It’s pale face stared at me. Those eyes I dread seeing every night. It was as if it looked through me. As if it was dragging me down. Down to the place that it calls home. 

That was the last thing I saw before I fell backwards and woke up the next morning in my room. But this time I had a new memory.

I never tell anyone of the moments when it comes. They wouldn’t believe me. Every time I see those hypnotic eyes that seem to draw me in, stopping me from looking away or closing my eyes. Even if I was able to look away, then I would still be able to hear those blood curdling screams my parents would tell me about in the stories where they would wake up to that same sound every night. They were just stories surely. I have no way of knowing if I will ever escape what happens when the sun goes down. "

The sound maybe, the crackle of song spun in to the air, a resonance as it slowly feed’s with deep unmistakeable intent.

The warmth maybe, caressing every inch exposed to it, whispering with each steady pass sliding over and beneath each layer of clothing and none alike, a invitation to welcome it’s comforting embrace.

The ashes perhaps, the remnants of a slow, beautifully warm, embrace. Welcoming, a disguise of destruction as it slowly savors every piece, leaving only a fragile cinder of what was.

She smiled at him, her ember eyes swollen with pride as her children gleefully savored their meal. A small, glimmer of gold reached through the flame meeting his gaze for but a moment as he slowly looked up in to her inferno.

She decided to name him Enrique, a foreign, exotic name that made her think of late-night trysts on a moonlit beach in another country.

   
 

Enrique groaned, rattled the chains that held him to the wall. Even here, on the Railroad, these creatures were treated like less than animals. She reached out a trembling hand to Enrique's face.

   
 

""Are you suicidal, or just stupid?"" She snatched her hand back and spun, recognizing the voice before seeing his smug face. He was leaning against the jamb, smiling his superior smile, like an older brother who had caught his sibling with their hand in the cookie jar.

   
 

""I... I wasn't..."" She hated herself for stammering.

   
 

Jesse's smile twisted into a hateful smirk as he made his way into the room in what Hannah knew was a practiced swagger. He ran this stop on the Railroad and that tiny bit of power had turned him into something repellent. He stopped next to her, close to Enrique, and his lip curled in disgust as he examined the chained ex-human. She noticed, not for the first time, that his eyes were hard and cruel.

   
 

""Why do you help them if you hate them so much?""

   
 

""This is the best way to get into the hemp panties of all you bleeding-heart chicks."" He stared pointedly at the parts of her anatomy he was most interested in, winked, and turned to leave. She heard his voice in the hall calling back to her.

   
 

""Seriously, moonchild, leave it be. They're monsters.""

   
 

She stared into Enrique's eyes. ""You aren't a monster,"" she whispered. 

   
 

She didn't know where he was freed from, which plantation or factory or arena, but it didn't matter. She moved closer, and Enrique strained against his chains. His eye seemed to look into hers as deeply as she was trying to look into his. Her hand drifted up to what was left of his cheek.

   
 

""Not a monster at all."" It seemed to her that he laid his head against her hand, just a little, drawn by the warmth and comfort of human touch. Her hand traced its way to the buckle in the back, felt her fingers slowly disengaging the leather. It dropped to the floor like shed skin. Enrique's head twitched.

   
 

Full, soft lips. There was hope in those lips, in that eye. They said there wasn't a cure, but they had cured everything else, so why not this? Maybe it was something as simple as love, as basic as kindness. With the certainty of youth, she stepped even closer, arms out to embrace this creature, this *man*.

Instead, they made an incredible breakthrough.

Herman was always a stickler―never wanted to change.  Isn't that what every declining generation does?  Clings desperately to the last pieces of their time?  When he had been young, he watched the elderly reject technology―at least until it became impossible to reject.  Now that he was in their shoes, he understood, to some extent, why they did it.  

When they had brought back the first samples, they tested them, then tested them again.  Their findings were amazing by all accounts, but most curious was the clay.  It was alive―much like a plant or a bug―but was just as unthinking as them as well.  They tested on animals, then on convicts, then on willing participants.  It was always a success.

Ten years later, when not a single scientist, doctor, or researcher of any kind could prove that it had ill effect, it was brought to the public's attention.  It was a cure-all, they said.  It was able to replace parts of your own human body, elongating life indefinitely.  First it was the celebrities―the self-centered and the jealous.  Eventually, it began to catch on with people in middle class, then even working class.  It was used in moderation by most, but others went far more than was necessary―leaving almost none of their true bodies behind.  Finally, another 14 years after it had been offered to the public, after thousands and thousands of trips to Mars and back, those who had never changed their bodies were in a minuscule minority.  Throughout the world―faces, arms, and bodies―all of them were cold and artificial.

Herman laid in a hospital bed, surrounded by his family.  He had been offered the choice to be augmented by the clay, but he had refused.  He wanted to ""die clean.""  It was prideful, he knew, but he wanted it his way.  Breath started to become thick and unresponsive, but he knew he had some time left.  He almost wished he didn't.  It just didn't feel right, looking up at his family, and not being able to tell one from another.  Each orange, sculpted face was too similar to the next to tell apart, and his despair was as bitter as it had been for the past few years.  His daughter and his grandchildren and his family were simply...perfectly sculpted machines.

And it was terrible to breathe his last breath being watched by these perfect, emotionless masks."

Well, except for Rudolph, he was off doing a photo shoot with Santa somewhere, the Diva that he is. 

Anyway, Donner started the meeting, “Gather ‘round, boys, gather ‘round. Now, listen up. Everyone knows to leave milk and cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, right?

“Yeah”, Blitzen shouted

“Calm down, boy”, Donner said. 

“But, what about us? We get hungry too, right?”

“Yeah”, Blitzen shouted again

Donner just shook his head

“Now”, he said, “We would like some corn, or some carrots, or even a nice big piece of fruitcake.”

Reindeers love fruitcake. 

Donner continued, “But, no!!! Everyone just forgets about US, but I have a plan”

He gathered the team in closer. 

Moments later, they all stepped back, Donner said, “Got it?  Good!!!  That’s the plan.”

As the days went by, the reindeer ate as much food as they possibly could, without getting sick, of course. It was all part of the plan

Christmas Eve came, Santa gathered the team and harnessed them to the sleigh. 

Rudolph was last to arrive, he was too busy polishing his nose. Clueless, as usual. 

The elves loaded the sleigh with toys, Santa gave Mrs. Claus a kiss, and away they went. 

The trip went off without a hitch, and so did the plan. 

Santa and the team arrived safely back at The North Pole. 

The reindeer were happy and dancing. 

Santa said, “Ho, Ho, Ho, looks like you boys had a good time tonight.”

“We sure did, Santa.”, Donner said. “We sure did”

The elves unloaded the sleigh, Santa unhitched the team, letting them wander in the field to wind down, then went into the house for some hot cocoa and watch a little TV. 

Mrs. Claus greeted him at the door, handed him his cocoa, and they snuggled on the couch, watching “Miracle On 34th Street”. 

The original, not that crappy remake

“We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this breaking news bulletin.

They’re waking up to find what appears to be huge piles of reindeer shit that have fallen from the skies, landing on cars, houses and front yard Christmas decorations. 

There are no reported injuries, but experts say the cost of damages is in the millions. 

We’ll have more on this story, as it unfolds. 

Now, back to our regularly scheduled program.”

Santa’s eyes widened, his face red with anger. He bellowed, “Donner”

Donner stopped mid-stride in the field, turned to face the rest of the team, Except Rudolph, who is wrapped in a nice warm blanket, somewhere, like usual. 

Donner smiled and said, “Good job, boys....Good job!!!”

a1xiss,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a1xiss/the_mistake_house/,The Mistake House,324,16,1543619330.0," 

The house was all wrong.

On the outside, it looked fine—blue Victorian two-story. Gray shingles. A brown door, which Mom despised. One porch swing with a chain that could snap at any moment. A minuscule yard, with grass just short of dying and a paved walkway to the street.

Inside, the layout changed. Rooms switched places every day. Hallways tipped toward hell, listed left and tripped their occupants. Floors inclined or declined without explanation. Without consistency. Lights flickered, but when that was the least shocking thing that happened in the house.

We moved in seven months ago. We should have moved out right away.

The house was all wrong then, and now so are we.

On our last day, I awoke in the middle of the night. My bed had moved across the room. I sat up and hit my head against the window sill, which was halfway up the wall now.

I rubbed my skull and stared at my door, much farther away than it had been. That was nothing new.

But my mother's scream was.

Throwing off the covers, I leaped out of bed and ran toward the door. The floor lurched beneath me. My stomach lurched with it. Wood and metal groaned as the room changed shape again. I froze. I didn't have time for this.

""*Laurie!*""

My mother's voice struck my spine like an arrow. Goosebumps rose on my arms. ""I'm on my way!""

She screamed again, but this time, her voice didn't form any words. The floor stopped moving. I didn't waste any time examining the new layout. Instead, I burst through my doorway and staggered out into the hall—and promptly froze again.

Normally, Mom's room sat next to mine. Now it glowed at the end of the hall—a beacon in the darkness, thanks to the lamp on her nightstand. I sprinted toward it without thinking, hurtling into the room without stopping to reorient myself.

What I saw there stopped my heart.

The furniture in my mom's room had become a tangled mess. Her desk and bookcase formed a misshapen totem pole, with books sticking out of the wood in all directions. Her bed, split in half, cornered the desk/bookcase mutant like bookends. An enormous chasm spanned the floor. Instead of revealing the living room below, it appeared to open into some insane abyss.

But that was all tame stuff, compared to my mother.

The *abomination*—as that was all I could think of when I looked at what had been my mother—stood impossibly tall and thin, like it had been stretched out almost to breaking. The Eldritch entity waved its useless, flesh-colored tentacles at me, flashing jagged teeth from the mouth in its chest. Its eyes were massive—one winked from its hip, the other leaked tears at the creature's stomach.

I could only watch, helpless, as I felt my bones break and my organs switch places.

The house wasn't only rearranging its interior.

It was rearranging *us*."

The hustle and bustle in the city was wearing us down, and the lifestyle just wasn't for us. So we finally made the plunge, and moved to Billunvue a few hours away. And it was perfect.

Everybody was really nice, always smiling and stopping to chat. My wife Nora made friends with the other wives of the neighborhood, and I was always welcome to the men's poker game every week. After a few months things had settled into a nice rhythm, I'd been promoted, we'd gotten a new car...and Norma even got our first child. 

But then the staring started. Everyone still smiled, and everyone stopped to chat. But it seemed like every place we went people would stop their conversations and look at us expectantly, as if they were waiting for us. It got so bad we started staying home a lot more often to try to relax. Then they all started coming around, one by one, to check on us and see how we were doing, how the baby was coming along. ""Is everything alright?"" ""Is there anything we can do to help Nora with the baby?"" 

It finally got so stressful that we decided to go spend a few months with Nora's parents until little Jack was born, just for some extra help and peace. It wasn't until our tires were slashed that we thought maybe somebody didn't want us to leave.   "

I don't really know anything about what happened except for the fact that it resulted in the loss of my hearing, completely. Growing up deaf has had the obvious challenges of, you know, not being able to hear and all, but it's not as simple as that.

I can't say I have a favourite song because I don't remember hearing one,

I can't hear the sound of people singing to me on my birthday,

I can't hear the sound of my dog barking happily when I get home from school,

And I can't hear the sound of my front door being forced open.

I cant hear the sound of a struggle between the intruder and my mother who is alone downstairs.

I can't hear the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer to my bedroom.

I can't hear the sound of my bedroom door creak open as a figure moves towards me.

You can probably imagine my surprise when I turn around to find a man stood in front of me with an abnormally large smile spreading across his face as he raises a blood stained knife above his head.

I was high atop a ridge and stilled my horse when I saw them: a woman and boy down by Percy Creek, peering into the water.  It happened quickly: The woman gestured, the boy looked closer, and with a flash the boy’s head was forced underwater and held firm until long after all was still.

By the time I arrived to the edge of the creek she was gone.  

They say your past catches up with you, and I am proof that it is true.  I haven’t lived a godly life.  But I am no killer.  Truth is, from the day I first drew breath the world’s been looking for a reason to make me swing.  

Hands shackled in front, two officers push me through the jeering crowd.  A woman in white reaches out with a laced handkerchief and places it in my hands: “A bit of company for your journey.”  I lift the handkerchief and breathe it in: the smell of a woman, one last time.  

Atop the gallows I look out into the crowd, and there is the woman in white—an island among a sea of arms and fists.  Our eyes meet, and I am chilled—her blank expression has turned into the slightest of grins.  I open my mouth to exclaim: “Look!  It was not me!  She is here!” when the noose tightens and I am gone.

\---------

A storm rages as I push up through the mud and draw new breath.  The handkerchief was her last cruel act to an already doomed man, but she has made a mistake: I am not dead, not completely.  And now I have her scent.  

I move up through the woods towards her house at the edge of town, her smell guiding me like a blazing signal fire.  I pass a gypsy camp in a clearing, keeping to the darkness beyond the treeline.  They are deep in revelry under their tents: fiddles, guitars, drums.  As I move up the rise, the sounds of strings begin to fall away, until finally I am left in the darkness with only the pounding heartbeat of drums.    

A clap of thunder.  Her house is aglow in lamplight.  Drums distant and steady.  She is there, gazing out a window and down into the darkness.  An anxiety she cannot place.  

Lightning strikes close and for a moment it is bright as day and she sees me.  If she ran just now she might have time, but nothing now is hers to choose.  

She is inside a dry house, yet as I approach through her garden she can feel droplets begin to fall onto her pale skin and nightgown.  Just a few at first, but now as I step onto the porch the drops become torrent.  

She crosses her arms, hugs them tight against her body, and quivers.

I am the storm and I am the gale, and I will breathe her in again.  "

Well fitting considering almost everything pushed out to eat has been genetically modified and the lack of organic food being sold to the masses makes for some pretty serious side effects.

A town over from my small, isolated, farm has gone off the rails. I live with 8 siblings and my parents are scientists. They grow our food, naturally, and take good care of us all. We don't eat the GMO foods and rarely ever leave the safety of our house. 

I snuck out and went to town to realize why. Riots, murders and muggings running rampant in the streets. People don't look like me and my family either. Their faces droop, eyes sunk in, all rather thin or extremely obese. I became a target when they noticed me. ""Frankenstein!"" ""Freak!"" ""Monster!"" They'd yell. I had no idea what they meant. They looked like the monsters to me. I was rather handsome and looked healthy. As people did before the GMO outbreak. 

I drove back home. I noticed my parents at the door and they became livid. ""You could've been KILLED! You're not like them, they're crazy!"" They scolded.  I headed to the room shared with my brothers and sisters. I smiled fondly towards the new siblings being created, that grew in the incubator across the room. I loved our peaceful house. Good thing I grew here, not in a filthy city being shoved GMO products down my throat, losing my mind. Good thing I have lived a natural life! Growing me here was the best decision my parents ever made. I'm just glad I have nothing to do with the GMO crisis. "

A lantern set high above the snow, falling in sheets over the road. Who could blame anyone really, the air was so cold it cut like razors against the skin, the road so isolated surely anyone wandering only had death as company. 

It’s no wonder really, surely you would have to have a hole of a heart to leave a lonely traveller to their fate on such a night, who could have such a heart? Surely mostly no one. Who could say no? With the air biting at each exposed soft area of skin, the wind pushing and pulling right through you like little demons finding their way deep beneath the layers of warmth, taunting and whispering lies of what waits in the dark. 

The car was a welcome sight, a desperate savior in such a harsh circumstance. Truly the situation was of circumstance, perhaps for both, or perhaps more for one. Honestly there is no way to tell, perhaps there might have been had the night gone on a bit longer but...now there is no way to know, there is only speculation. 

Before now, one might have thought the flicker in his eyes was that of surprise, or regret. One might have assumed, that when she slid the knife into the side of his neck that somehow every voice warning him against hitchhikers suddenly all began to echo at once.

It was 11:43am and he had worked up quite an appetite after spending most of the morning fishing. Across the distance of the water he saw a Father helping his son set a line. Seeing a young child learning to fish brought a smile to Peters face.

Peter opened up his tackle box and pulled out a cold brew, and the sandwich he had prepared before leaving home at around 5am that morning. He opened the can and took a long sip, the cold amber liquid immediately took the edge off of the long week that he had. Coming out to the lake and fishing was what kept Peter grounded, it was his slice of Heaven on Earth.

He had been coming to this lake ever since he was a child, and knew the place better then most in the area. Peter bit into the ham & turkey sandwich, savoring that first bite of food for the day. He chewed slowly and enjoyed the perfect day this had turned into.

Suddenly Peter felt something strange in his mouth, like a long hair… or string. He used his fingers to dig around and could feel something besides food in his mouth. When he attempted to pull the string out of his mouth he felt a small tug from it. Pain struck Peter as he felt a sharp metal hook tear through the flesh of his right cheek.

He let out a scream, but was to far away from anyone else to be heard. The Father and son across the lake didn’t seem to notice, and happily continued fishing. Peter looked down and could see what looked like a large fish hook protruding from the side of his face. He grabbed onto the line and tried his best to pull it out of him, it resisted the attempt. The more that he tugged on the line, the more it seemed to pull back.

Then the line began pulling harder. Peter held on tight and tried to hold his ground, but wasn’t nearly strong enough. He was ripped off of the bench and dragged along the grass towards the shore. The line appeared to be coming from the lake itself. Peter dug his boots into the sandy beach trying to resist the pull, but didn’t seem to have a chance. His feet reached the icy cold water and he let out one last final scream. Blood gushed from the side of his face as he lost the grip he had held on the line.

Peter was dragged into the lake, entirely submerged. Bubbles of oxygen and ripples from the fight were gone within a few moments. What a catch!"

Her long hair dripped into the bubbling current as she picked her bare feet across the wet rock. Her green dress was given elegance by the shimmering grey cloak that draped across her shoulders; the hems drifted like fog over the water and reeds and mossy stones. Every movement of her was poetry as she came upriver to my tavern.

And why are so many brave and beautiful and generous people rotting into the cold dirt who ought to be alive? And why are so many people alive today, who ought to be dead? Will you tell me that now?

Ten thousand heroes from my youth swore their oaths and took up arms for honor and right, and then died in foreign lands begging for their mothers' faces one last time. And ten thousand slimy things lived on without them, and I as well.

The queen by the river side was weeping bitter tears, letting them drop two dozen at a time into the running water. Her keening cries tore the still air cruelly, shaming the birds and the foxes into silence.

The band of young men in my public house saw nothing when they gazed out the window toward the river where my queen wept. They heard nothing but the sound of guns and drums. They drank and thought deep thoughts, and they imagined stories they might tell one day. They tested each other with jokes and dares to see if there was a man among them who would admit to fear. One last day of freedom before submission to the reveille and all the proper ordinances.

And why is it that old men must go about picking fights and stirring up trouble, and from there go about their business? And why is it that youths, who still don't know how soft a cailín's hand can be, must go and die in the cold mud, bleeding frozen blood, and themselves without a Christian burial?

And I always thought that's just fairy tales and stories.

Like the story of Little Red Riding Hood, which teaches children to stay on the path. Or the story of Snow White, which should teach why you should not accept gifts from strangers.

But what if monsters really exist? If they do not look like wolves or old witches but like the people closest to us. Monsters that do not suddenly jump out of a dark corner but slowly take over the bodies of the people we trusted. When your own family is no longer the loving people they once were.

During the day, the monsters hide in the depths of the soul, but when it gets dark or quiet, they come out.

Drooling, craving, stinking.

And if nobody believes that monsters really exist? If your own mother thinks you're crazy or too sensitive because she does not see the monster even though it's right in front of her?

Do I have your attention? Good. This isn’t just a story. It’s a warning. I know, I know, you’ve seen all these before on here. “The world will end in 2022, I’m a time traveler, blah blah blah.” I’m not disparaging these individuals, not at all, merely saying that they were lying.


I’m not.

&#x200B;

Some of you might know me, some of you might not. I’m all over TV, the news, social media. I guess you could say I’m kinda a big deal. Or I was. Until I lost my power.

&#x200B;

That’s right, I used to have power. Ultimate, supreme, omnipotent power. I could’ve reached through your computer and spoken this to you if I so chose, but no longer. I’ve been stripped of my power.

&#x200B;

It didn’t happen overnight, mind you. At first it was just little things. I wasn’t able to stop a rising dictator. I couldn’t stop a tsunami from sweeping through a country. I couldn’t dissuade an unstable individual from running for president.

&#x200B;

I’m still unsure of why it all happened. One day I woke up no longer among those I had cared for for so long. Rather, I woke up one day under a covered bridge. Naked, with no money, no ID, no fingerprints, and no identifying features. I look as plain as any of you now. I walk amongst you, powerless, not knowing what went wrong.


I think that’s the worst part of all of this. I can’t explain any of it. If I had an explanation, a scientific reason for why I am the way that I am now, it wouldn’t be so bad. But I guess there never really was an explanation for me, so why would there by one for my loss?

&#x200B;

The reason I’m writing this is simple. Humanity is doomed. Not in the sense of “global warming is destroying the planet” or “WWIII.” I’m talking extinction. All of humanity, wiped off of the face of the Earth, with no real effort. I foresaw it when I took my throne. In only a few decades, there won’t be a single human left alive. I took steps to stop it when I had my power, but now that I am “human,” I have no sway over events. I am merely an observer, doomed to die alongside a species I loved. It is the will of God. He will strike you all down, wipe you out as you would cut down an aging tree. He intends to start over, remake society in his own image, as I once did.

&#x200B;

I was God. I was all powerful, loving, generous. But now He has taken over. I know not of his name, only his intentions. God is not dead, he has been replaced. And as I was once a loving God, He is a vengeful God. I can do nothing. I must watch, observe from my place on this planet as the human race is eradicated. I am sorry.


I am Lucifer.

&#x200B;

I am the Fallen One.

&#x200B;

I was God.

I was cast out.

I was forsaken.

I don't know why, but I was extremely frustrated. Depressed. I only had my four-year-old daughter. She was the only one I had to love, and I could barely feed her. I couldn't give her the life she wanted. Walking down that road, anger overtook me to a point of numbing serenity. I looked up at the sky, as if in a search for a sign from the stars.

Then, I saw a balloon. White in colour, gracefully floating in the sky, giving off an aura of freedom and light in a sea of darkness. It gave me hope. It was inanimate, but it seemed ... happy. It was happiness in its most pathetic form, but it felt as if gaining it would at least give my life some meaning. For a moment, having that balloon was my only desire in the entire world. I went to grab it, almost in an act of reaching for my very soul inside that balloon. But, looking down, I saw its string in the hand of a young girl, around three years old. That's it. I couldn't stand it. 

After a while, I returned home. I was excited, as I had a special gift for my daughter. I would finally get to see a smile on her face. I entered her room with the gift behind my back and saw her playing innocently by herself.

""Hi, daddy! Is that red balloon for me?""

""Sure.""

It was a woman, wailing.  

Armed with pitchforks and torches, the men started to huddle in groups. 

All agreed that the sound came from the abandoned tower, the only structure at the mountain. 

So, they climbed to their roofs to investigate. 

And what they saw made them tremble. 

A behemoth beast — a dragon — flying, circling the tower. 

Its bone-chilling roars shook the ground. 

A handful of the search party ran for their lives.

Like venom, panic quickly spread among the townspeople.

In a hurry, the wealthy fled empty-handed.

From a small bustling hub, the town quickly shriveled to ruins and empty houses.

Days passed until a person — a warrior — arrived in town. 

She is going to climb the tower, she told the remaining townspeople in their hiding places. 

""Are you going to save the woman?""

She shook her head. 

""No, I'm saving you.""

This puzzled the townsfolk.

Days passed and people started thinking the warrior was burnt to a crisp. 

They couldn't believe their eyes when the warrior came back with a bloody sack.

She emptied the sack and a severed head of a woman rolled out.

That night, the townsfolk celebrated.

Soon after, families started returning and rebuilding their livelihoods."

Due to the wars, the chance to farm human blood was long gone, but vampires learned to live off the blood of pigs and cattle.  “Human,” became a name of an extinct species.  As the centuries passed, vampires, like their predecessors, sat above fickle evolution, and yet to some, the horrors of the past lingered in their thoughts.

These thoughts crept through minds when the first body was found in the old alley.  Eyes wide with hollow screams, black blood splattered across the floor and walls, the source of which was a large wound in the victim's shoulder, limbs strewn around like toys.  Debris nearby suggested a struggle, though not much.  This unholy, soulless corpse met its end to something darker than the world had known.  Shocking most of all, was the familiar marks of teeth surrounding the wounds.

“It's an animal. A beastly, rabid cat.”
“Impossible, it must've been a pack of wild dogs.”
“That much blood? With flesh still lingering?”

No explanation satisfied terrified terrors.

“Dhampir.”

A vampire of vampires.  The mere existence of that term sent shivers down the cold bodies of monsters.  The word spread like fire, consuming the vampires as the fire of old did in legends.  Soon the night-stalkers would fear going into the darkness, lest you be lost to a Dhampir.

As more bodies began to pop up, each gruesome in their own way, organized teams were created to hunt down the unseen menace.  In irony, they grabbed their torches and weapons and marched off to nearby forests to seek out the monster.  And alas, nothing came fruit.  “Stay inside,” was the only advice the beasts who had only known power could muster.

...

The past finds ways to slip in unseen and nature never is bested forever.  Evolution churns slowly, rebalancing power in the world. 

The gaunt, blackened figure crept along the walls of the scent it picked up, finding more joy than practicality in its movements.  Silently opening the door of the resting vampire, it stood and sniffed the air.  The smooth, eyeless visage of the nightmare surveying the area, finding the best angle of attack.  

With a sadistic intellect, acquired long ago by its ancestors who took refuge in caves and lived off hate, the creature wheezed a laugh, woke the vampire, and tore him apart."

But that was before an unnatural amount of waste seeped into their roots and cut them down like a virulent and biblical plague.

But that was before the clouds spilled acid rain without pause, every drop bearing the chemical sin of mankind. 

They would offer well wishes towards those who planted their kin.

The worst thing happened was when old Rex Stephens was hit by a bullet while hunting in the forest. He survived. Otherwise we only have the normal small town madness. Like old Tucker Mills, who rioted after our summer party because he had too much beer. Or when Ethel Barnes and Cyntia Noble once again got into a fight about who makes the best kidney pie. My favorite ist the one from Mrs. Noble, but i don’t tell old Ethel.

Sometimes tourists get lost while hiking in the woods. Some were even attacked by wild animals. But murder, no, we hadn't one yet.

And now there is this man in our cell. He just sits there. Covered in blood. With this crazy, wide grin that makes him look like a doll. His skin pale and thin, like paper. Skinny, but muscular enough to stab this poor young woman. Such a pity. Such a pretty thing.

I got the emergency call when we just wanted to open the second day of our autumn festival with the baking contest.

Our autumn festival is well known and attracts hundreds of tourists every year. Had the man come on another day, he would have been noticed immediately by the townspeople. We know each other. And if the city is not flooded with tourists, strangers are immediately noticed. He neither looked like townspeople nor „normal“ tourists. His clothes smelled like big city banker, mile against the wind.

The man and his victim apparently both arrived here yesterday independently and checked in at the hotel. The receptionist reported that she had seen how the two later went to her room together. The woman obviously badly drunk.

When the maid wanted to make the bed in the morning and entered the room she found the two of them. The victim with a dozen stab wounds, her belly cut open and a puddle of blood and guts surrounding her. The man crouching over her liefeless body like a wild animal, chewing on a piece of her flesh, sticking his hands in her corpse up to his ellbows. Laughing hysterically.

He was still sitting there when my deputy and I picked him up and locked him in the cell. There he sits now. With that crazy grin.

My duty now would be to call someone. An official who picks him up and presents him to a judge.

But this is my town. Here I am the law and justice.

I go to him. Unlock the cell. His eyes change from crazy to confused.

He hears the crackling as my bones move. He looks as my teeth are growing.

In his eyes I only see panic. I can smell his fear.

In a town whose inhabitants are a pack of werewolves, there is no murder.

Just another missing tourist."

I will tell you about this scary dream. The dream started off with me in my bed sleeping while holding my teddy bear and my night light lighting half the room. I rolled over to the other side to get on my pillow and I fell right off the bed. My coat rack fell and broke the night light and hit me on my head. I tried to get up, but the dream wouldn't let me get off the floor. 

And this was in complete darkness, me on the floor crying for my mom and dad to come help me. My bedroom door slams shut and the TV powers on by itself, slowly lighting the room back up. The screen shows a man walking closer towards the inside of my screen and informs me that ""She's coming to get you"". It then transitions to a white screen, a hand slams onto the screen of my TV and this woman says ""No one will hear you scream"". Then I woke up from the dream in my bed shaking with fear. 

I felt immediate relief when I saw the sunshine coming through my windows. As I got up to use the bathroom, I noticed that I had a very painful bump on the top of my head. I was confused because I got hit on the head in the dream, but was in my bed the whole time."

&nbsp;

I heard him, heard him loud and clear. The situation we were in had no room for slowdowns. What separated me from my partner Mike was merely a gap with a river flowing below.

Jumping across wouldn't be a problem. Never had a fear of heights or being swept away by water.

&nbsp;

""Chris what are you doing? Just JUMP.""

&nbsp;

What petrified me was what we just did. I just can't stop thinking about it. Oh God what have we done? What have we-

*bang*

&nbsp;

The sound of gunshot brought me back to reality. I looked behind me.

&nbsp;

""You fucking monsters...""

&nbsp;

At a distance, it was the mother, frantically stumbling out of the forest wielding a shotgun.

&nbsp;

""Give her back..."" She aimed the weapon at me, ""Give me back my baby daughter!!""

I gripped the burlap sack tightly. 

""CHRIS"", Mike yelled.

I jumped. I didn't look back and jumped. I could hear the woman attempt to shoot only to scream profanities as the gun needed to be reloaded.

&nbsp;

""Fucking took you long enough"" Mike helped me up ""Alright we need to move NOW""

&nbsp;

We shuffled into the opposing forest, breaking her line of sight. While running I could still hear her demanding her child back.

&nbsp;

------------------

&nbsp;

We took a breather and sat down after getting deep into the forest.

&nbsp;

""Hey, give me the goods""

&nbsp;

I threw the sack at his direction. Mike opened it up and pulled out 4 green medium size orbs. He started to scan each one with his phone.

&nbsp;

""Ten, ten, ten and.....Ten! Nice, this was a good haul."" Mike put back three orbs and passed one at me ""Here's your share. An extra five for a job well done""

&nbsp;

I just looked at the orb. ""Mike, what have we done? She was just a child. She was only 1 month old!""

&nbsp;

""And now she's a middle aged woman in her forties"" Mike retorted ""You know what they say, they grow up so fast""

&nbsp;

""How could yo-""

&nbsp;

""Don't. Stop right there."" Mike interjected ""If you were so against this, you could've given up 5 years of YOUR life to make your sister young enough for her cancer to be treated. Yet...""

&nbsp;

He brought his hand into the air.

&nbsp;

""Here we are. This was your answer, Chris.""

&nbsp;

I couldn't say anything. Just sat there defeated.

&nbsp;

""Alright..."" Mike stood up ""We better get moving, there's no guarantee they won't search this area.""

&nbsp;

And once again we went back into our escape plan. We reached another gap on our trail.

I jumped with no hesitation.

a0vuur,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a0vuur/until_it_hits_zero/,Until it Hits Zero,38,1,1543332620.0,"   Number Twelve- That was my lucky number. How couldn’t it have been, it was on everything I owned and saw. From food orders to baseball shirts, it was always there, following me.

  Well, until I got a little bit older that was. My lucky number just seemed to vanish from my life, like it was never there in the first place. This wasn’t a big deal, of course, no one is ever too concerned with random numbers.

  But a couple of years later it began again, but it wasn’t the same. Now instead of lucky twelve, it was the number ten. I started to see it everywhere, from bus stops to school papers and even in my college dorm, it seemed to be everywhere I looked.

   I went online, trying to find some explanation of this phenomenon that was happening to me. I found some interesting things, dipping into Numerology and Astrology, but try with all my might I couldn’t find a good answer for the longest time. 

  Until I found a forum with some people talking about seeing the same number over and over. Most of them saw numbers like 333, 444, or something like that, but nowhere could I find anything on what had happened to me. The numbers I  saw had changed…

  I decided just to ignore it, it was probably just a series of coincidences that could never really be explained, and so I did. I got out of school, got a boring desk job and that was that. Life was so bland for me. I was a middle-aged man working a desk job without any real friends. 

  Until the heart-attack. 

  I was rushed to the hospital after collapsing at work, I remember the sirens of the ambulance blaring as I went in and out of consciousness. I survived, of course, and woke up to the mildly relieved faces of the doctors tending to me. That’s when I saw it, the number four. It was everywhere, on the T.V, the room number, and everywhere I looked. 

  Then I realized something. I’ve lived so long ignoring these numbers and what they’ve been trying to tell me, that I’ve been ignoring the truth. From Twelve to four the numbers have been counting down, like a clock. Growing smaller and smaller as I grow older and older, and only now I saw it.

   I saw my life play out before me, how I had done nothing with my time here. How easily I was to describe and how wasteful my life had been. Now the number I see has changed to a one, and I know I don’t have much time left. 

  So please, use me as an example. Don’t let your life run out, don’t let the numbers hit zero without living first."
a0rmun,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a0rmun/prophets_really_do_exist/,Prophets Really Do Exist,51,7,1543295017.0,"My dad claims to be a prophet; he has the power of precognition. Whatever he says, comes true. When Aunt Jessica didn’t listen to the prophecy of her unfortunate hit-and-run case, the next day she showed up dead. When the neighbour next door did not listen to my dad’s pleas of keeping his door close, he was mugged and killed. When my colleague did not listen to my father’s advice of staying away from water, his body was found in the pool in his backyard.

Loads of people have called him fake, but not me. Since the unfortunate accident in his childhood when thunder struck him and blew his right arm off, I knew it had changed him. My dad had done hundreds of predictions; small ones related to fates of people and most of them came true. Supportive son is what he called me. I know it was true because I was the only one who stayed by his side. 

Recently, my dad made another prophecy. He claimed that he would die in a fire. And as I stand right now over his knocked out body, pouring oil over him, I wonder. I wonder if anyone saw me leaving my colleagues backyard or knew how I’d run over Aunt Jessica while she went out for groceries. I wonder if they knew I mugged the neighbour as he waited for the pizza man to come, or even for that matter making my dad’s last prophecy come true. I am a proud son, knowing that most of his prophecies came true and the ones that did not were my fault. And so I wonder, for how long will I have to do this to make people believe that **Prophets Really do exist**."

The walls, with aged and water damaged wood paneling, seemed to creep in closer with every loud tick of the clock precariously tacked to one of them.

“We have plans for you.”

A small, grimy utility sink dripped with a non-pattern so close to regular you couldn’t help but focus on it; the apprehension of the beat that will never be on time. The noxious smells of mildew and industrial cleaners come in waves, making the meager bologna sandwich on stale bread in front of me even less appealing.

“We have plans for you.”

Fluorescent ballast lights flickered overhead; their blinking emphasized by the ceiling fan hanging below them, creating a sickening light-drone reminiscent of a David Lynch film. The sort of optical symphony that implies you will be here for the rest of eternity.

“We have plans for you.”

The clock ticks. I manage to eat the sandwich. The dry bread sticks in my mouth like craft paste. Better than nothing; it’s been hours. It will be hours again later.

“We have plans for you.”

A statement that rings through my brain, originally spoken so cheerfully- now in its n'th iteration decidedly a threat. It always is, in its own special way. A promise of, well, nothing. A promise that at best is simply a lie to keep you going another day; at worst, a promise that you will be additionally inconveniencing yourself for their benefit- with no benefit to you.

“We have plans for you.”

The promise of yet another visit to this dingy room. The promise that these measly stale sandwiches will have to do for another day. The promise of continuing to exist like this. Exactly like this, for the foreseeable future. The bitterness comes in waves, writhing like a snake.

“We have plans for you.”

I stand up from the sticky, slightly broken chair, ready to make a run for it. For a moment, I see my whole life ahead of me. “I have plans. For me!”

The clock ticks. Time’s up. I wash my hands in the grungy sink; the sticky tap handles nullifying any clean feeling that could result. “One more day,” I think, as I exit the musty break room, back to work.

“They have plans for me…”"

My mother had me very young, it was just her and occasionally girlfriends around while I was growing up. She had always told me I was going to be special. Taught me the ways I should live. ""I was divine"" she'd say. And it would be said in her thoughts, so I knew she was telling the truth. 

I was sent off to a foster home at 15. Apparently the social worker didn't agree with her ways and saw her unfit to parent me. Charged her with ""child endangerment"" I didn't need food to survive, but they wouldn't know that. ""They're ignorant,"" mother said. The same social worker ended up dying of ""mysterious causes, not a single mark left, or poisons in his body, "" the coroner said. It was left undetermined. But I knew. My mother was divine. 

She couldn't escape jail time, and neither could I. My foster parents, however, allowed me to see her. They thought it was strange, my ""parents"" and the officers, that all we did was stare at each other, but they wouldn't understand. We could have conversations with our minds. I told her about the pheromones I smelt on my foster mother. She told me what I had to do.

Months later, we welcomed baby Anna into the home. She seemed divine. What a shock my parents came home to. I could read their thoughts and disgust when they came home to their daughters sacrifice on the living room floor. They were just ignorant.

I hid outside the house feeling rejuvenated and oh, so powerful. Baby Anna truly was divine. Her innocence gave me new types of magics, as mother said it would.

Bleary eyed, I switch on my bedside lamp and check the clock - 2:42am.

Fuzzily, I wonder why I'm awake at such an ungodly hour, when the noise that must have roused me sounds again. A rattle of plastic and the shatter of glass.

Scavenging foxes are a regular nuisance here and bins are a favoured target. I don't want to face ripped garbage bags and rotting refuse strewn across my driveway in the morning - hopefully I can scare the creature off with a yell from my window.

As I get to my feet and yank the curtains open, I wonder why a fox would be going through a recycling bin filled with nothing but empty bottles.

The curtains are open before I finish the thought.

In my driveway, lit by the orange glow of the street lamp, is a hunched figure. Clad in a filthy coat, greasy, matted hair falls forward over its face. Its head is buried in the recycling bin. Around it, fragments of glass catch the light from the street lamp. 

The figure rummages face first in the refuse, the noise of clinking glass intermingled with splintering and crunching sounds as its jaw moves under the veil of filthy hair. 

The figure suddenly stops. Slowly, it raises its head. 

Bloodshot, rheumy eyes stare at me from a face riddled with scratches, scabs and open wounds. The skin, already pale, is made ghostly in the glow of the street light. The nose is only half there, ending in a ragged stump above puffy lips. 

The barely human looking thing locks eyes with me. 

Slowly, it's face spreads into an obscene grin revealing jagged stumps of teeth. The flesh around its mouth splits, opening oozing wounds. Shards of glass embedded in its gums glinting in the light. 

To my horror, the thing begins rising to its feet. It takes a step forward toward my house. 

Suddenly, twin beams of white light appear in the road. I hear the hum of an engine and I tear my eyes away from the hideous face to see a car approaching from the end of the street. 

When I look back, the figure is gone. 

I don't dare go back to sleep. After double checking the doors and windows, I scurry back to my bedroom and wait for sunrise, trying to force the memory of the grotesque face from my mind. 

When I summon the courage to step outside the next morning, I can't deny what I saw.

Fragments of glass litter the ground and bloody smears are spread across the broken bottles. 

I haven't recycled glass since - I avoid buying bottles and jars, and those I have to go straight to the landfill. 

It hasn't made me feel much better though. Some nights, from the other houses on my street, I still hear the crunching of glass. "

Four of them in the past two months. It started out unsurprisingly. Couple druggies, couple prostitutes. But now the owner of Southside Bar was gone. A bank teller. A teacher at Bowling Green High. 

The tension cut through the banality. The Pike County Police Department doubled their street presence. What used to be annoying speed traps transformed into the comforting mini-fortresses of protective guardianship, trying to return a sense of normalcy to an area unaccustomed to this level of violence and anxiety.

Officer Ken Kirby rolled through the names of the missing in his head as he sat in his patrol car one late November evening. *Sharon Johnson... Tim Monahan...

He knew it was his job to help bring peace to his community. 

*Bart Denison… Avery Ford… Lisa Wofford…* Lisa’s loss was tough on Ken’s daughter, Victoria. Victoria and Lisa’s daughter Erica were good friends. They had gone to dinner before homecoming together a month before Lisa’s disappearance. Ken would never forget his daughter’s tears that night.

*Violet and Steve Theodore…* married six months, Violet had just moved from Iowa to support Steve as he joined his dad’s lumber business.  *Pauline Jaspers… Caroline Peverly…* Ken hadn’t known them. 

A mid-2000s red Buick leSabre broke Ken’s thoughts. His radar read “62” as it zipped past in the 45 mile-per-hour zone. He flashed his lights and siren on and pulled behind the car, as it quickly saw him and pulled to the side of the road. 

Ken walked tensely up to the window as it rolled down revealing the nervous middle-aged woman inside. “Oh! Ken!” the woman said softly.

“Well, hello, Marla!” Ken replied, smiling gently. Ken knew Marla from Bowling Green Diner. She’d been a waitress for years. “Marla, you were going a little fast, did you know that?”

“Ken, I’m so sorry. I was just thinking about all those missing people. Pauline was just in the diner for breakfast the day she disappeared last week and I...”

“I know, that’s so sad about Pauline,” Ken replied. “That’s OK, Marla. I want you to be safe, so you gotta drive safe, alright?” 

“I will.”

“OK, hang tight right here.”

Ken went back to the patrol car and turned off his dash cam, made sure to wipe it as well. He walked back to the Buick. 

“Marla, come with me. We have some reports of suspicious activity in the area, so I’m going to give you a ride back to your house for ya. Another trooper will come get your car. Just leave the keys on the seat.” 

“That’s awfully kind of you,” Marla said, stepping out of the car. They walked together back toward his car. 

“Marla, wait a second, I think I hear something.” She paused. “Goodbye, Marla.”

a0i5li,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a0i5li/travel_tip_for_the_weekend/,Travel tip for the weekend!!,7,4,1543226398.0,"Here's some advice for the casual weekend trip.

Five tenths are not the same as one half.

Five tenths can look like anything under or over one simple half if done correctly.

You see, if you split a person in half from the head down using your trusty heavy axe, you can still say there is half a person fallen on each side. And they are hard to carry, those two half-nuisances. Takes a considerable amount of effort to drag a long, limp half-person to bed.

But shoving a homemade bomb down his throat to explode the fucker in ten pieces, then randomly piling five of them on the big silver tray makes it so much more enjoyable and fun. Anyone taking a glance at the pile of fresh meat could never guess how much of a body was there. Half a person? One third? Seven quarters? So intriguing, so exciting. Yes.

It becomes a real feast for the senses, dumping those over the clean, new hotel sheets, all lights out, then revelling on them if only for a couple of minutes, softly rolling around, bare skin being gently colored by the thick smelly elixir of life. Top it up by drinking the champagne the poor guy brought upstairs hoping for a five dollar tip. Hell, shove a five dollar bill on him. He did a good job. You did a good job, too. So splash a bit of the champagne over your confused sick head; cool your mind down, you deserve it.

Now don't you go putting the clothes back on yet! Sneak out the window to properly cleanse yourself at the pool, then dress, then leave.

See you at work on monday.

Sarah sighed. ""Yeah, and I agree that we shouldn't talk about that, especially since we have fresh bodies that just came in, including Mark. You know how I loved Mark.”

Andrew laughed. ""But this is interesting. And actually, I heard this from Mark yesterday. You know what makes it more interesting? People usually experience that out-of-body phenomenon while in this state, right after the heart stops beating, when we pronounce the patient dead.""

Sarah was listening uninterestedly while cleaning the bodies. ""Those were the experiences the patients tell, when the doctors successfully 'restart' their hearts, either via CPR, defibs, or other methods,"" Andrew continued. ""I don't know, maybe they experienced some kind of hallucinations or something as their consciousness slipped away, little by little. Is this proof that there's no afterlife?""

I couldn't even care at all about what Andrew was talking about, as I felt so sleepy.

Sarah slammed her equipment down on the table. ""Can you make my job any harder? I have to clean my boyfriend's body by myself here, and you’re not being helpful! Ugh! The life of med students!”

“Alright, alright, calm down. Sheesh.” Andrew raised his hands. “I’m just thinking this might take your mind off from him since it happened so fast. That multiple car accident, so horrible. Thankfully you weren’t in that car. He was on the way to pick you up earlier tonight, no?”

“Alright! Alright then, I’ll entertain your thought if that will make you stop bothering me!” Sarah shouted impatiently. Her voice was trembling. “By your theory, these bodies can still hear what the living says around them? So, do you want to say something to Mark before I prep the body? He wasn't just my boyfriend, he was your friend too you know. Just pay him some respect. You are joking around too much. This is serious.""

""Oh, of course, let me tell him in private, man to man,"" Andrew said, giggling at his own joke, after which I could hear Sarah let out another disgusted groan. I could barely feel his warm breath on my cold, stiff neck as he whispered in my ear, ""I guess messing with your car was successful. told ya I'd win. Sarah's mine now. Bye."""

An older man was sitting in his lawn chair by the trailer, drinking a bottle of Cutty Sark Scotch Whiskey.  ""Tonight is The Night Of The Goblin, Fan"" he told a hippie teenager who emerged from the trailer just then.  ""Yeah Dad, what's your ghost story about it?"" Fan wondered to him.  ""Well, the goblin crosses dimensions through that mirror that I own on this night the man who I bought it from told me.  So, we'll all wait and see ha!"" Fan's Dad went on, laughing.  ""Groovy!"" Fan added.  

A teenage boy snuck around the trailer from in the back, aiming a pistol at Fan's Dad.  ""Alright Professor Pinecock, I stole the mirror you're talking about man!"" he yelled at Fan's Dad.  ""Oh, Dad, look out!"" Fan screamed.  ""Hold it, don't pull that trigger son!!"" Professor Pinecock begged him.  But, the teen did, shooting him in his ankle.  He and Fan screamed and the teenage boy fled in a truck with the big mirror in the back of it.  He drove on the country-road and stalled suddenly.  ""Ah come on man, no more gas!"" the teen protested, hitting the steering-wheel.  As the thief got out of his truck and jogged on foot through a nearby woods, a badger-like goblin emerged from the mirror.  The monster sniffed the air and laughed deeply, scurrying into the woods in its brown cloak and cap.  

It reached the teen and growled at him.  ""I smelled ye scent and pursued ye.  Fore ye have stolen thee mirror and harmed its owner"" the goblin barked out at him.  Its yellow eyes shifted around and the teen shot at it in its clawed-hands.  Yellow-slime oozed from them and the goblin slashed his throat with its black-claws, killing him. The pink-fleshed monster then tore into the forehead of the body in the dark, with its black fangs, growling away.  

Professor Pinecock was on crutches inside the trailer one day, as a record of ""Turn! Turn! Turn"" By The Byrds was playing on a record-player.  ""Mr. Pinecock sir, I'm Deputy McNulty how do you do?"" a cop who knocked at the screen-door called.  ""Oh, Deputy McNulty fine thanks"" Professor Pinecock answered.  ""Good.

The place was out in the country and as we passed the far and few between gas stations and local Piggly Wiggly supermarkets I knew there would be nothing exciting in this town.

I was wrong. As we pulled into the driveway of our new farm house, I sighed. It was nice. There was tons of field to farm on, a patch of woods, a pond, and the house had a front porch, as well as a balcony. We move into a house like this and no one will ever see it. I thought. My parents noticed my distraught and tried to cheer me up by telling me I could go explore the back yard, where the woods and pond were. Might as well. 

I began my long stroll through the vast fields to the pond in which I'd map out then head towards the forrest to do the same. As I approached the pond, I smelt a rancid smell, to my surprise it was a dead raccoon. Holy shit! I cover my nose and made my way around the pond only to find more small dead animals; birds, fish, lizards, squirrels.  I gagged at the smell and began to feel quite odd. I peered into the water and noticed something. A glimmer at the bottom of the pond. 

Through the thick dark sludgy water I saw this glimmer and took an urgent interest in it. It was as if it was beckoning me to come get it. Coaxing me. I felt endorphins rushing to my brain and felt at ease. This place isn't so bad. I felt a certain urge to step into this pond. It's as if my feet started moving before my brain could tell them to. 

Ankle deep, I felt at ease. Knee deep, I was going to collect whatever was glimmering. Hip deep the water felt abnormally cold for the summer but I was so close to the glittering gem. A drop off led my next step to be shoulder deep, the water felt freezing. I finally put my head under and dove towards the treasure. Reaching my arm out, I felt sharp pains on my forearm, as if something had dug its sharp, long, nails into me. I was panicking. It was pulling me away from the glittering gems, about 20 of them all in a pile. I was so close. I can't hold my breath much longer. I just descended as an incredibly strong and painful grasp pulled me along. I finally passed out.

Awakening I only saw the surface of the pond. I had no body to move. I then saw in the distance a young girl. About 8 or 9. She looked at me grinning and reached out, then proceeded to step into the lake.  "

He brought his face to the gap and peered through. The stool threatened to throw him off but he regained his balance, his technique was down to muscle memory by now. He could see right up to the edge of the garden if positioned himself right, further when the trees lost their leaves. This was his entertainment each day. While Mother was out. She didn't like him looking outside, in case the bad guys see him. But he didn't care. He was 5 years old now, he could look after himself. The boy heard the door unlock and quickly jumped off the stool. He dragged it across the kitchen and placed it beside Mother's chair at the dinner table. She came in just then, and the boy held his breath. She grabbed him by the shoulders. ""Have you been peeking again? You know you can't do that. What is our rule?"" The boy avoided her eyes. ""No looking, no laughing and no leaving the house."" ""Good. Never forget that. Now go to bed, you're not getting dinner tonight.""

The boy was furious. There was so much to do out there and so little in here. He wanted to run through the grass and throw stones and climb trees. He wanted to find the singing birds and chase them through the forest. He didn't care about the bad guys.

It was morning, the boy had woken up with the sun. He was ready. He pushed open his bedroom door and crept down the hall to Mother's room. She was asleep, a single key poking out from beneath her pillow. With a deep breath and a shaking hand he reached out and pulled it free. He looked at Mother and felt a pang of guilt. It quickly dissipated, being replaced by excitement. He left the room and headed to the front door. He had never used a key before. After a frightful few seconds it clicked and he was out, running through the fresh air and wet grass. He felt amazing, and couldn't help but laugh. He bounded through the forest, his outstretched fingertips whipping against hedges and leaves. Eventually the forest turned into fields and then into a long track of smooth stone. He had never heard about these before but with his newfound courage decided to follow it. Soon he saw other houses, these ones bigger than his and Mothers. His nerves began to return as he thought about Mother's warning. Is this where the bad guys live? He cautiously passed each building, inspecting each one.

Then he noticed something. On the wall, a piece of paper.

He looked closer, it couldn't be. No it was. A picture of a boy.

It looked just like him, except younger."
a08slu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a08slu/the_generals_collection_of_heads/,The General's collection of heads,18,2,1543155379.0,"History possesses many disturbing stories and that of Major-General Robley's collection is certainly no exception. Robley was a British soldier who served in New Zealand. While there, he became fascinated with the savage beauty of Maori culture. He amassed a huge thirty-some collection of the freakish Mokomokai, preserved tattooed heads of Maoris. Today, it resides here in the American Museum of Natural History; a week ago, I was approached by a magazine to compose an article on it.

And so, that is how I came to be standing here before a collection of human heads, like so many China dolls in an antiques shop, but far more unnerving. Everything about them looks off: the white bared teeth set against the dark leather of their skin, the squinting eyes, the alien symbols of the tattoos. Perfect, I think. The editors will love this. I unsling my camera, taking several photos until I at last get the perfect shot.

""Ah, good to see you. David, isn't it? From Conneticut, right?"" says a small man in tweed and wearing buggy spectacles. This is one of the museum's curators. We make introductions. He talks plenty, animating his hands excitedly. The Mokomokai, he tells me, became valuable commodities for Maori to trade. Sometimes, Maori would even raid enemy tribes to capture slaves, then brutally tattoo and execute those slaves to make more heads. I write that part down.

""So these *Moko* tattoos? They were, like, a mark for death?"" I interject.

""For those slaves they would have been. But in actuality, the tattoos were a commonplace mark of status for the men of highest standing in society. That the heads are still preserved to this day is a marvel. They are a memento to a culture now largely forgotton. It's like they are speaking to us from across the grave!"" he said cheerfully.

We shook hands and I went home. Later that night, I was staying up late labouring over the article. I get out a print of my photo from earlier for reference. I'm looking back and forth, between my writing and the photo, flitting my eyes here then there - when the picture changes. Yes, something definitely is different: the heads weren't smiling before, they definitely weren't grinning with evil cracked gapes or some of them with their mouths frozen mid-laugh.

I cry out suddenly and throw my hands up to my face; it feels as if several fishing-hooks have just torn at my skin. The blood runs through my hands and into my eyes so that I can't see.

Cursing, I knock my chair back and somehow stagger to the bathroom, where I wrench a towel off the rack, then turn on the tap. I wash the blood off. My face still stings. I just stand hunched over the sink for a moment.

Then I look up at the mirror and see the tattoos on my face."
a08k5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/a08k5d/i_see_ghosts_everyday/,I See Ghosts Everyday,27,4,1543153325.0,"Everyday in class feels like an eternity. For how long must I stay here? I want to go home already. Everyday it's the same: the teacher reciting her notes, indifferent to the students' inattention; the students' eyes glued to their cellphones, indifferent to the people around them. Strange isn't it? People all around us yet we prefer what's virtual than what's reality. This new society makes me sick. I'm glad my upbringing did not involve such distractions. 

When you've been in this purgatory of a classroom, you're bound to start daydreaming. Your imaginations take over your head, as unconventional they might be. Sitting by the window,(my back faced towards it) I imagine myself getting shot. I don't know why though. I mean, who would shoot a highschooler? I don't know any dangerous people and I'm pretty sure they don't know me either. Stray bullets are rare but still a possibility. It's Baltimore after all. It's an unnerving feeling. Just as I feared, with a bang the boy sitting in front of me dropped. Oh nevermind. The sound was of the window being forcefully closed and he was merely slumping down to pick up his pencil. I need to calm down. Still, is a change of seat too much to ask for? I ask my teacher everyday to change my seat. She just looks around confused and ignores me. Listen to me for fuck sake. It's not like the people I sit with would even mind. They don't even talk me. They would barely notice if I moved. Yet I'm stuck in this God forsaken seat. 

Another example of my imaginations would be that of an apartment near the school. It's nearly 7 storeys tall where I was at the ground floor of my school. Everyday I see the same people: a firefighter and a casually dressed middle aged man. Everyday. Odd isn't it? I can't help but make stories out of the two. Maybe the firefighter tried to save the man during a fire. But that wouldn't make sense. During a fire why would the man run to the roof? A more plausible story would be that the man tried to commit suicide. At the last moment he changed his mind and hanged onto the railings for his newly found life. The people called firefighters as they couldn't bust the door to the roof open. The firefighter smashed the door open and lend the hanging man a hand. Whether that worked or not, the answer should be obvious to you guys reading. 

I've been stuck here for nearly 60 years. It's been nearly 60 years since that day. People have moved on, but I haven't. People don't see me but I do see them. My rooftop neighbors have been there for far longer though, so I shouldn't complain.

Let me back up. This whole thing began about 2 weeks ago. I was bored and decided to check out a local yard sale. There was a nice pair of Beats, and they were only $14. I couldn't believe my luck until it came time to pay. The woman at the table looked at the headphones, then back at me with a worried expression.""Honey, you don't want these.""

""Yes, I do. Why could pass up a bargain like this?"" I attempted to break her cold stare by gesturing at the utter garbage that was being sold and saying sarcastically ""It's a treasure trove, really.""

""I know, I know, this shit isn't even mine. The damn couple next door just up and left in the middle of the night. Didn't even bother packing anything. Hell, their suitcases are on the red tarp."" She jutted her chin in the direction of two old suitcases.

The tarp wasn't very far from where I stood. I tried to quell the panic in my throat when I noticed that the suitcases was originally white in color, and a thick crimson liquid had been soaked into the fabric.

I looked away, pulled my wallet out of my back pocket and tossed the cash on the table. I didn't want to spend a second longer in that place.

It wasn't until I got home and did some research that I found out that the headphones I just purchased were already hooked up to a BluTooth microphone, which hadn't been on the table.

It's midnight, and my headphones are turned off, but two voices began to beg for their lives.

""Please, help us. It's so cramped in here.""

""We will suffocate without your help.""

So I did what any rational adult would do. I put the headphones up on Ebay. Let someone else deal with the spirits. After all, I didn't need more skeletons in my closet. The woman at the register would not be lonely in there. "

Her grandma was blind but her mother would always say that she could still see more than most people. That claim never made any sense to Misty.

""Grandma?"" Misty asked.

""What is it, pumpkin?""

""Do you think I'll get married?""

Misty was always marrying her Barbie and Ken dolls but now wondered what it'd be like to be the bride for once.

""I do believe so..."" her grandma murmured sweetly.

""To who?""

Her grandma was silent for an uncomfortable moment. Misty looked up at her and was shocked to see a fearful expression on her face. Her brows were furrowed and mouth agape. Misty tugged at her sleeve. ""Are you alright?""

Her grandma snapped out of it and Misty saw a tear roll down her face. ""You'll marry someone, Misty. Someone with eyes like sky,"" she said softly.

Misty smiled to herself. She imagined her own blue eyed Prince Charming waiting for her to walk down the aisle.

Seven years went by and it was the five year anniversary of her grandma's death. Misty missed her dearly.

She was sixteen now and was getting ready to go to her junior prom with her boyfriend Mason. He was supposed to be here at seven but it was almost eight now and he hadn't showed up. She called his phone but he didn't return any of her calls.

Misty was furious and heartbroken. Her father drove her to her prom, tears ruining her makeup.

The next day, Mason's sister broke the horrible news to her.

Mason had died in a hit-and-run accident.

Misty was completely shattered. She'd loved Mason and genuinely saw herself marrying him someday.

She never thought she'd get over him but ten years had passed and she was marrying, Brandon, the love of her life.

Her married life was picture perfect but it wasn't until the next year that things began to go awry.

Crows would circle their home. Cutlery would go missing and then turn up in random places. And the AC never seemed to work.

Misty was concerned about these odd but seemingly related events. Brandon reassured her each time but the uneasy feeling never left her.

Misty woke up one morning to a fiery sunrise. She walked outside to some neighbors basking in it's glory and even taking pictures.

The sky was red.

Later that night, Misty awoke at 3 AM and noticed her husband wasn't by her side. She got up to get a glass of water. As she made her way back to her bedroom she was met with two glowing red dots in the dark room. She quickly turned on the lights to reveal her husband smiling at her. ""Come to bed, love.""

And suddenly it made sense.

He doesn’t draw often. It’s not a hobby. It’s just that sometimes, he is overcome with the urge to draw, and he picks up a piece of paper and a pen and gets to work. 


When he was in the sixth grade, we got an angry call from his teacher. She said that he’d been drawing in class, even though they were supposed to work on their math assignments. 


“He just wouldn’t put down the pencil,” she told my parents. “He completely ignored me.”


He took the drawing home with him.


“Look at this, mom,” he said, but she ripped it out of his hands and tossed it aside, so that she could give him a stern talking to.


But I saw it. It was a house, licked by flames. Three stickfigures stood outside, their hands raised to their heads, and their mouths were O’s. Another figure laid flat on the black line that represented the floor of the house. Its arms were tossed up into the air and it had X’s for eyes.


The next day, a fire burned down our home. Our dad didn’t make it out of the house.


I started taking his art seriously. One time, I was ready to walk out the door to go to a concert. He stopped me. 


“Wait,” he said. “I’ve got something for you. Don’t leave.”


He grabbed a pen and paper from the kitchen drawer and started to draw. It was a long-haired stick figure in a dress, walking next to a tall building. The “Fort Wood Bingo Center”, according to the sloppy lead letters on the roof. A typical bald, smiling stickfigure stood behind her, with a gun in his hand. I decided not to go to that concert.


The next day I read an article in the paper about an old lady getting mugged before being shot to death across the street from the Bingo Center.


When Grandpa died, we hopped onto a plane to New York City, where he lived, to attend his funeral. 


We fastened our seatbelts. My mom looked out the window while I listened to music. My brother was asleep on take-off, but he suddenly woke up with a loud gasp. 


“Paper,” he said, a statement rather than a question. 


I rummaged through my purse until I found an old receipt, and a pen and handed them over to him.


He started drawing. Black pencil waves, and a sun in the top right corner. He paused for a moment, to look at me. I looked back, and nodded to the paper, as waves of panic drowned my stomach. *Keep going*.

I grew up in a small town and always dreamed of becoming a reporter. Unfortunately, I did not make it further than the local newspaper.

My editor asked me to accompany Officer Dan today. For 30 years he was the Higway Policy Officer responsible for a stretch of Route 20 that was not far from my hometown. He took his lunchbreak every day at the local diner and was kind of popular. So I was supposed to write a story about him, now that he was planning to retire. It was agreed that I should accompany Dan on his tour.

Officer Dan was a calm, elderly gentleman. He knew this stretch of the road like the back of his hand. We chatted and I asked him about his experiences here on the road. He said that the worst thing he ever experienced during his service time was a serious accident. The car had strayed off the road and sank into a swamp beside the road. Later, the car was pulled out of the swamp, the driver and her child could only be found dead. That happens too often here, Officer Dan said, people are careless. They try to take a shortcut or look for a place to spend the night in the open and the swamp has a new victim. Bacause of that, 3 hitchhikers who were last seen in the area have gone missing over the years. He described the swamp and the road like living beings. Entities that had their own will and would feed on lost souls. I shivered.

After a while, we discovered a broken-down car. A black 1973 Pontiac Grand Am, so the statement of Officer Dan. The car seemed to have an issue with the engine. The bonnet was open and the driver had leaned over the engine. Officer Dan got out to ask if the driver needed help, so I stayed in the car. I could not see the driver clearly from my position but i saw him wearing jeans and a brown leather jacket.

I flipped through my notes to check if I already had enough material for the story.

When I looked up again, there was something on the ground. A puddle shimmered on the tarmac. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move. Someone had sneaked up beside the car, and tore open the door. I felt a cloth being pressed on my mouth and nose. Then everything went dark.

When I woke up, I was trapped in the trunk of the car. Officer Dan's lifeless body next to me. A deep gaping cut in his throat.

The car lowers further down at the front. I smell moss, mud and peat. I tried to open the trunk lid, unsuccessful.

My mobile phone has no reception, but a recording function.

My time is running out. The water is already flooding the trunk. I hope someone finds this recording. Mom, Dad, I love you."

I lean back in my chair, gazing into the flames, a generous measure of whiskey at my elbow, as fat snowflakes fall outside. The crackling fire lulls me toward sleep, my eyelids growing heavy in the failing light. 

&#x200B;

I jolt awake. My mind is foggy and I seek the sound which roused me - the tap of stone on stone. 

&#x200B;

The grate is filled with glowing embers, but nevertheless the room is icy cold. On the hearth, I see fragments of soot blackened brick and I scold myself for my panic - the house is old and the chimney crumbles in high winds. Shaking my head, I move to add a fresh log to the fire. 

&#x200B;

An explosion of soot bursts from the chimney, and I fall back wheezing in the toxic air. My eyes water as I wipe the stinging ash away. 

&#x200B;

I watch in horror as a hand, charred and blackened, emerges from the flue. Skeletal fingers extend from the opening, each a dozen inches long. The fingers probe the fire, curling around a glowing ember. I watch, transfixed, as a new intruder emerges from the chimney. 

&#x200B;

A tongue - a foot long, thin and glistening. It snakes down, steaming as it wraps around the smouldering remnant proffered by the grotesque hand. 

&#x200B;

The tongue retreats, and I hear the sound of crunching, splintering wood, followed by a hiss and a satisfied sigh. 

&#x200B;

The hideous tongue emerges again, probing the glowing remains, assisted by the charred fingers. 

&#x200B;

I hear a desperate whimper; it takes me a moment to realise that it has come from me. 

&#x200B;

The tongue and hand freeze. As if guided by unseen eyes, they both turn towards me. Another hiss rattles from the chimney. 

&#x200B;

The hand moves first, groping across the hearth, cracked fingers twitching as it probes the rug. The tongue follows, bobbing in the air like a cobra. 

&#x200B;

Both move towards me. I clamber onto the armchair to distance myself from the vile appendages. 

&#x200B;

The arm stretches to an unnatural length, flexing at joints that no human limb possesses. The serpentine tongue follows, the cracked tip flicking. 

&#x200B;

They are almost on me, the grasping fingers inches away. 

&#x200B;

Without conscious thought, I reach out and grab the glass, flinging the whiskey into the fireplace. Amid a shower of glass a white hot flame erupts. A shriek assaults my ears as the demonic limbs retreat. Plaster flakes from the ceiling and I hear thuds and howls above, heading away into the night. 

&#x200B;

I awake the next morning, sprawled in the chair. 

&#x200B;

The chimney sweep I summon turns pale when he sees the claw marks in the flue. He crosses himself, mutters prayers as he leaves. 

&#x200B;

I have booked passage on the next ship bound for the tropics, heading for climes where I can go to my bed with every door and window sealed. Where no fire need be lit. 

&#x200B;

I shan't miss the winter. "

Her bottom jaw cracked, the sickening crunch resonating throughout the room. It slowly dropped from her head. Hovering only a few inches below it. 

My eyes widened in shock.

“Honey?” 

Despite her injury, the sound of her voice was completely unchanged. 

“What’s wrong?” 

As she reached for my shoulder, her fingers came loose. Their tips were first, cleanly severed at their joints. Right through veins. Right through bones. I expected blood to come rushing out and all over the floor. 

But it never did. It had already froze. 

And I could see everything. 

I screamed for help. 

In my morphine-induced haze, it never occurred to me that all I had to do was blink.

I sent out texts until one reeled in.  Party at Simone’s place on the other side of town and I was already down three beers.  Woulda waited five but the uber showed up in two. 

Before I knew it, we were on our way. 

I clipped in my seat belt and figured I’d make the most of the conversational warm up. 

“Good night, mate?” 

The uber driver glanced in the mirror and continued to drive. 

“Uhh. . .  Good night so far, mate?  Customers been treating you well?” 

Still no response.  I figured the guy wasn’t the talkative type and would give him a one star once we were done with our trip shenanigans.

Instead,  I took to surfing the web.  We had an ETA of fifteen to Simone’s party.  And while it wasn’t a terribly long stint, I wanted the time to pass as quickly as possible. 

That was cut short when my signal dropped. 

I glanced up and at the surroundings.  It was dark out, with no street lights or sign of town.  I didn’t remember it being this way last time I’d gone to Simone’s but figured the uber might’ve taken a detour. 

“Excuse me, mate.  How long until we arrive?” 

Still nothing.  Fella didn’t even glance back. He just kept driving on.  With the help of the vehicle lights, it was clear that the road ahead lead out into the forest. 

My heart pounded in my chest.  

“Think you might have taken a bad turn.  Yeah?” 

He continued driving.

I swiped over to uber.  Map didn’t load, neither did the driver details.  It had all gone to custard along with the signal ten minutes ago. 

“Mind pulling over.  We’ve done a wrong turn,” I said, trying to hide the fear in my voice. 

But he kept on, with no recognition that I existed.

I pushed on my seatbelt clip.  It clicked but didn’t release.  

“Hey, mate, there’s something wrong with my belt.” 

Nothing. 

I pulled forward, but the belt held its locked position pinning me firmly against the chair.  I tried the window next, it didn’t budge.  Tried the door, but the lock and handle didn’t work. 

City was twenty minutes behind now. 

“If this is a joke, you need to pull over and stop now.  Dammit!” 

Same old. 

I worked at the belt with my teeth, kept going until my gums bled. 

And the bastard at the front, he didn’t do a thing, he just kept driving.

Hayley knew. Her toes were numb. Everything was blurry.

But fuzzy Frank kept staring up at her with his black, glassy, teddy bear eyes, as if to say, “Can't you turn on the heater, so we don’t need all these blankets?”

“I can’t,” she said, “thermostat’s broken.”

“Get Mom to fix it.”

“Mom’s still asleep.”

“Tell Dad then.”

“Dad’s sleeping too. They won’t wake up and they smell funny.”

*(1 day later.)*

New adults came. They seemed surprised. They ran to her quickly, and picked her up. *Kidnapping,* she thought, *like in CSI,* and it scared her.

They pulled a white sheet over Mom and Dad.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*(3 months later.)*

Adopted. Fostered? It happened so fast.

They gave her to new adults. Parents. They smiled a lot, in front of the other adults. Agnes wore great globs of blue eye makeup. Terry was fat and wore a tie.

They both smelled like the homeless lady on 23rd, most of the time.

Auntie Agnes liked to draw in the air with a silver crayon and drink brown rum.

“Can I play with the crayon today Auntie?” Hayley would ask.

It was so pretty, like a mirror. Auntie told her it was magic and it drew red.

""Not today.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*(One week later.)*

Agnes shrieked.

She knew about the bedtime snacks with Frank.

She snatched up Hayley and raised the rod high.

This beating didn’t sting and burn like the others. It felt savage, like a steel bat on her black and blue legs, and it felt like her legs might break.

“Stay still you little RAT!”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*(7 hours later.)*

Everything hurt when she woke. Eyes were blurry.

There was a black shiny marble by her foot.

*Frank.*

It was his eye. The scattered fluff, that was Frank too. Her best friend.

“Frank!”

Hayley pulled her legs up to her chest and wept.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Things were different now, with Frank dead. To hit her like that. To kill Frank, cut him into pieces, sprinkle his body on her broken body.

No food for days. Scrubbing for hours. Now this.

She had to escape.

Then she heard it.

A voice.

“Frank?”

Something tugged at the corner of her mouth, and pulled it up into a grin. She’d know that voice anywhere.

It was Frank.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Snores came from the living room.

*One step at a time,* Frank said.

She tiptoed to the couch.

Standing on her toes, she reached over the back of the couch and drew a pretty pink-red line with the crayon, rose-red on Agne's throat. Auntie was right about the silver crayon.

*It’s a switchknife silly, not a crayon,* Frank told her, *you know, like in CSI. You need glasses.*

Whatever it was, Hayley liked it.

It drew straight and lovely, leaving a long, magical line of dripping red across the pale white of her neck. It looked more like paint than crayon, Hayley thought, but it was pretty all the same."

A lot of people tried to rebel against society ever since The Father came into power. But, they always end the same, taken outside the Plaza, nowhere to be seen again. When you see the same sight happening over and over again, you realize that nothing will change and everything will be the same.


Afterwards I head into the skyscraper and worked all day, sorting papers on what to keep and what to burn. Ho hum."

&#x200B;

Centuries ago, on an island girted by a churning sea, the mist descended. Choking fog filled the forests and reduced the sun to a feeble glow. 

&#x200B;

Villagers banged deerskin drums and lit great fires to ward off the mist each night, but still it crept in, tendrils of vapour slithering through thatch and rickety walls. 

&#x200B;

Children were taken first, grabbed by unseen hands from within the fog, their plaintive wails muted by the miasma, accompanied by gibbering, inhuman shrieks. 

&#x200B;

As the mist thickened, grown men and women were claimed as well. 

&#x200B;

From some villages, men went out into the dripping forests, bronze axes in hand, determined to rout the monsters that plagued the shadows. 

&#x200B;

Those few that returned were blank eyed and bloodied, muttering about demons of shaped shadow. 

&#x200B;

Only the soothsayers, long dismissed as fanatics and fools, seemed immune. They strode through the mist with impunity, wreathed in oakleaves and mistletoe. 

&#x200B;

As the villagers despaired, it was the priests who rallied them, told them what must be done to lift the terrible curse. 

&#x200B;

The soothsayers led parties of shivering souls to mountain quarries, burning human effigies to ward off the miasma while the masons worked. At their command, great stone pillars were hewn. 

&#x200B;

More were gathered, lending their muscle to drag the huge stones across hills and valleys, log rollers splintering beneath the weight. 

&#x200B;

Each night, the labourers cowered in a circle of flaming yew branches tended by the soothsayers, laid out in eldritch patterns, guttering as the mist probed the defences. From beyond the edge of the light came the hissing and chittering of the creatures that dwelt within the fog. 

&#x200B;

Finally, the priests called the sweating procession to a halt. They set to work heaving the stones upright, bid by the soothsayer to shape them into a great circle. 

&#x200B;

When the work was complete, the priests bid the people perform a final task. Another human effigy was built, greater than any before. 

&#x200B;

The exhausted villagers watched in confusion as the priests climbed atop the pyre, the first of their number bearing a burning torch. 

&#x200B;

A wail went up from the terrified onlookers as the torch fell. 

&#x200B;

As the priests were consumed by the flames, their intentions were made clear. The sun, long hidden, lanced through the clouds, aligned with the new stone gateway. 

&#x200B;

As the clouds boiled away, so too did the mist. Skeletal, eyeless figures lurking within its depths were revealed for an instant before they too faded with a hiss, as of water on hot stone.

&#x200B;

The people lingered for a time, dazed and directionless, before drifting away, returning to deserted villages and neglected fields.

&#x200B;

Though frauds and imitators claimed the mantle of the priests none ever regained their knowledge. The purpose of the great standing stones was forgotten, as was the art of their construction.

&#x200B;

The druids had planned as best they could - the stones would last for millennia.

But the day approaches when even they will crumble. "

In spite of Mommy and Daddy and their private worries, Josh found himself ready and willing to take on the mantle of Big Brother. He felt genuine affection for the small bundle of novel noises and scents and spent a lot of his time playing with her, giggling in delight whenever she would react with a smile or her typical wordless, happy babble.

Really, the only problem as Josh could see it was that the baby took a lot of time to care for and Mommy and Daddy found themselves tired and exhausted a lot of the time. Josh could understand that; the baby was loud and sometimes cried a lot for no good reason and this always prompted a reaction.

The baby was fun and really neat, but boy did it ever sometimes smell bad. One of the surest was the baby got Mom's attention was to produce a combination of powerful poop smells and a shriek to match. When such a shriek issued forth from the tall bassinet, Josh decided he was going to fix the problem himself.

There was a baby bath made of plastic and Josh tugged it into the kitchen, where the baby got cleaned all the time. Then, he set his little sister down on the floor mat. Her cries ceased once Josh picked her up. He had seen diapers be changed and he got this one off. So gross! Something the color of dark mud stuck to the absorbent pad. He tossed it in the trash, holding it by the tips of his fingers. Then, he used the baby wipes. This did not work too well, and it seemed to Josh that wipes alone would not solve the problem, after leaving greenish smears around her little bottom. He could not reach the sink, either. And where was the stuff they used? It still was really stinky. 

He pulled open the cabinet under the sink. After deliberating among the options, he decided that the bottle with the blue label seemed to do the trick. It smelled really funny but it looked like water. He emptied most of it into the tub and went over to retrieve Tess. Mom was going to be so proud of him for helping with the baby.

""Timmy's been dead for twenty years. What could I possibly know about it?""

""Dead? I thought he'd disappeared into Indigo Woods?""

""Twenty years is a long time to be gone. Timmy's dead.""

""But Timothy's uncle isn't. And he wants to know what happened. So we're opening the cold case and seeing what falls out. You were the last one to see him before he vanished.""

I sighed. ""Listen.

""Indigo Woods is a... a *weird* place. You look at a map, it looks like 30 square miles of greenery wedged up to the Appalachian mountains. But then you get inside it and...

""Listen. Detective. There are five streams that run parallel through the woods north to south. They shift course based on rainfall and snow melts. It's really easy to misjudge where you are. The trees are thick enough that you can't see the mountains when you're a stone's throw from them. Iron deposits nearby make your compass worthless. You can get lost really easy in there.

""Shit, man, people were getting lost up in those woods since before the Mayflower docked. Even the name. Indigo woods. There's nothing blue in there. It's a corruption of *wendigo*, a monster from Native American myths. You're starving to death, you eat your buddy, boom, you're *wendigo*.

I cut myself off. I was clenching my fists and almost hissing. I got a hold of myself. I wiped my brow free of sweat, trying for nonchalance.

""So Tim Logan walked in, got lost, and that's the end of it, huh?"" the detective asked. ""And the searchers never found a trace.""

""The searchers didn't *try*, man. All the locals know about Indigo Woods. The adults, they walked around near the edge and shouted for an hour or two, then went home.

""Listen,"" I begged him. ""I got lost right alongside Timmy.  We split from each other. No idea how; one second I'm clutching his school bag, next second I'm all alone out there. It was part sundown. Little slivers of moonlight cut through the trees. I huddle up by the trees. I heard...""

I shook my head violently. *No,* I thought. *That sure as hell wasn't Timmy I heard*.

""I got lucky. Picked a direction and walked. Timmy must have gone the other way. I'm sorry, I can't help you.""

I was a small-time drug peddler for a branch of the Mexican drug cartel in Chihuahua Sur. I mostly hanged out at the park near le prepa and sold weed to teenagers.

One day I had a question for mi jefe. I don’t even remember what the question was. When I asked him, el jefe just stared at me for a moment and then said, “I can’t answer that. I don’t think I’m allowed. If you really want to know, go talk to mi jefe.” He gave me an address and told me to be there a las 8.

I met el jefe de mi jefe in a dark, smoke-filled room in the back of a seedy bar. I asked my question and he said the same thing: I am not authorized to answer that question; Speak to my boss. It went on like this for a while. I met with jefe after jefe. Each of them told me to move on up the ladder for my answer.

Eventually, I ended up on the top floor of a skyscraper in El Centro. I stood uncomfortably in front of a fat man behind a huge, wooden desk. I asked my question. He said, “I can’t answer that, but there’s someone here who can.” He stood up and bid me to follow him further into his office. We turned a corner and there stood two guards on the either side of a red door.

“Go inside and you’ll see this . . . thing.” He said. I looked at him. His expression was serious. “Don’t freak out,” He said. “Just ask him your question. He’ll be able to answer it for you.” With that, the fat man waddled back to his desk. I hesitated for a moment. What the fat man had said chilled me to the bone. But I had come so far. I had to get my question answered. I opened the door and stepped into the room.

It was some kind of boardroom. There was a long table with chairs all around it. Various people milled about the room. Some were on there cellphones. Some were huddled together going over paperwork. At the head of the table was el jefe. He was calmly giving orders to those around him. He looked like a man, but I knew that he wasn’t. He had no color and his face was hard to make out. As soon as I thought I had discerned some specific characteristic, it seemed to change or distort. He seemed immaterial somehow. Like if I tried to touch him, my hand would go right through.

I asked my question. He gave me an answer. I left and never returned."

I had discussed deliriously over Show and Tell with all my friends, I told them that what I was bringing was a secret, but that they’d be shot dead with surprise!

I inched forward to them, careful to not wake them up, a rank smell, like a week old expired TV Dinner hit my nose, and I gagged profusely. “*It’s now or never*”  I exclaimed in my head. 

Getting past the stench, I dug into my daddy’s pockets, and came out with a slip of paper, it read out “19-15-4~” 

“No!, the last number is gone!” I exclaimed wildly, and yet my parent’s still made no sound. 

I dashed over to under the nightstand with anger in my heart, I’d have to guess the last digit.

“19-15-41, No” I said under my breath.

I am standing right at the gate of the mansion. 5 minutes, that’s all I got. I need to find out who is hiding here and smash that coward onto the ground. I am not supposed to be here honestly, but I just want to see Dorothy to make sure she’s okay.

I sneaked upstairs. The bedroom door is closed, seems like someone’s talking inside. 

“Gladly we got this done real quick, Kevin’s gonna get here in any minute.” That’s my girl Dorothy, seems like she was talking to someone.

“Yep, I just hope we got more time to do this, hopefully this is good enough for you.” There's a man. What are they talking about? Is Dora cheating on me?

“I like that for sure. You always know the right spot. Just, let’s keep it secret, deal?” God dang it.

“Yeah, I better leave now, you know, before it’s too late.” Man, he’s coming out, I need to hide! So that’s the story huh? You found me, killed me and took my wife away from me? YOU ARE DEFINITELY GONNA PAY FOR THIS. I stepped backward out of instinct, back to the shadows and wait for my turn.  

Suddenly, I lost my balance - I missed my step over the stairs. I fall and hit my head onto the marble floor heavily. 

Apparently, Dorothy hears it. She dashed out of the door, ran downstairs and hold me in her arms. I can see the flowers, air balloons and colorful strips all over that room, and a banner with “Happy birthday Kevin” on it. 

I am the only one to blame. My suspicion blindsides me.

\---”Now it’s time.”

My feelings are fading away. "

Let me guess, still single?” Uncle Scott says, his oversized smile stretched across his oversized face.

*Let me guess, you still weigh 350 pounds,* I think.

“Nope, no dating luck for me.”

“That’s a shame. Well, see ya next Thanksgiving!” Uncle Scott slaps me on the arm and lets out a big portly laugh.

Truth is, I am dating someone, but it’s not a *cute girl.* It’s a boy. Something I avoid telling the chief homophobe of America.

My mom enters the dining room with two Banana Crème pies and sets them down on the table in front of us. One is in a red dish, the other yellow. One is with nuts, the other without. 

A group of cousins runs through the dining room and into the kitchen.

My mom turns back towards us and stops. “Hey, why don’t you two come in the front room? Everyone’s out—""

“I’m just trying to figure what we can do to help Chuck find a girlfriend. Isn’t it a little sad that year after year he’s here by himself? I mean don’t you want grandkids at some point, Gina?” Uncle Scott says.

“Chuck will find someone when the time is right,” she says, giving me a knowing look.

“That’s right,” I say, with a forced smile.

“Sad,” he says and directs his eyes to the pies. “Hey Gina, which one of these is nut-free?”

My mom glances at me again, then back to Uncle Scott. “Red dish,” she says and disappears into the front room.

The red dish is *not*the nut-free pie. I saw Aunt Tina make it. My mom saw Aunt Tina make it. I’m pretty sure my mom even helped her. So why—

Uncle Scott scoops up a large helping of the Banana Crème pie from the red dish.

I consider stopping him, then think back to the glance my mom gave me as she lied to him.

I exhale loudly. “Good talk,” I say, smiling, and leave for the kitchen. The rest of the group is in the front room watching football, the kids are outside. I notice Aunt Jenny’s purse on the kitchen counter. It’s wide open. 

I pretend to wash my hands while I peek inside her purse. Right there, on top of everything else, is Uncle Scott’s EpiPen in a blue leather case. I look around again, making sure I’m alone in the kitchen, and slip it into my pocket.

I pour myself a cup of coffee and step outside to watch the kids play in the snow. They are building a snowman. A *big* snowman. Almost as big as—

A loud crash comes from inside the house. 

“Oh my God—Scott!” Shrieks Aunt Jenny from the dining room.

I clench the EpiPen in my pocket and exhale, watching my breath float aimlessly through the air."

They always thought I would do this. 


“Child thief!” they called me, fingers pointed. “Witch!” 


I was still a young lad myself when they drove me out here, to the edge of the wetlands. I’ve lived in this clay hut for the past thirty years. It’s damp and cold, but now I have these little ones to warm my heart.


A little one had died back then, thirty years back, and the people of the Marshlands decided that it was my fault. 
When I looked at my own reflection, I knew that my skin was green, even in those muddy waters. That the blisters on my face oozed, that my left eye drooped and that I was hideous. 


“You are a monster!” they said. I knew that that was not true. 


They took out their pitchforks. One of their burning torches got so close. It ate away at my skin until it no longer hurt. I can see its bite when I look into the water. 


I came to this clay hut, then. It’s right next to the castle. The people wanted me dead, but the earl would not stand for it.


“He is not your child thief,” the good earl said to the crowd. ""This man's only crime is ugliness. Go find your monster. I promise you that he is still at large.""


He gave me this space then, and his protection. Came to see me a few times, when even the lowliest turf worker would not. He wanted my help, because he had a bad leg, and my mother used to make him a balm to relieve his pain. I did not know anything about medicine, but he never seemed to mind.


He is dead now, that earl. His son and heir too, I believe. The castle is quiet. 


My former co-workers are dead as well. The fields of turf are abandoned. Shovels still in the wet ground. A body here, a body there. Ooze drips out of their likeness now, too. Terrified looks on their petrified faces. Blood from coughing, splattered all over their shirts.


But the little children are safe. The ten that I have. I survived the plague once, in infancy, and now I am immune. They will not catch sickness in my little clay hut.

9zgolu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9zgolu/thanksgiving_day/,Thanksgiving Day,84,7,1542912049.0,"Every Thanksgiving while my mother gets dinner prepared, I play games with my cousins.  We usually play football or tag outside while my mom and the other grown ups work on getting everything set up, but this year it was too cold, so we had to play inside.

I don’t like playing inside on Thanksgiving because it gets so crowded and all the grownups are busy watching the football game or hurrying around to get dinner ready.  We tried to play tag, but after Marci almost broke my mom’s favorite vase, we decided to play something quieter – hide and seek.

I counted to ten while everyone else went to hide.

I found Marci in the basement, Thomas in the closet and Lacey under the table.  The only person left to find was Aiden, my little brother.  We searched high and low for him and couldn’t find him anywhere.  We even started asking the adults and calling his name to tell him he won and that we didn’t want to play anymore.

The scent of the turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes was wafting through the kitchen as we searched for my little brother, looking under beds and in cabinets and even outside.

It wasn't until I saw the raw, uncooked turkey sitting on the counter that the horror dawned on me.  In the hurry to get dinner ready, nobody had seen him crawl into the oven, nor heard his screams after it was set to preheat."

""You wouldn't want to end up with a job you hate."" 

""Yeah, thanks,"" I replied. 

I had been job hunting for around a month now, as I got laid off around a month and a half ago. As I have yet to be successful, I'm guessing not a lot of people want to hire a failed doctor. It was starting to get hard on my wife, who worked as a lawyer and had to come home every night to crying one-year-old twins. I have yet to understand how she calms them down. 

I grabbed my jacket and walked out of the door, heading to the car. Once I started things up and got situated, I started the ten-minute commute to the interview. 

.         .          .          .          .

""Guess what, sweetie, I got the job!"" I exclaimed, smiling and embracing my wife. I, for once, had gotten home after her. ""Isn't this great news?"" My smile widened as I looked at Crissy's face. So smooth, pale silky skin. Her eyes always shone so very bright, bright and green. I moved my hand to my pocket, wanting to show her something. I stepped away from her and untangled myself from her. 

""Yes, that's great news baby!"" She smiled as well, congratulating me.

""Crissy, I want to show you something too."" I pulled the object from my back pocket. I hid it in my sleeve. ""Come closer a bit, will you? I just want another hug."" 

She came closer to me, her arms outstretched. Poor darling. I plunged the object into her chest, twisting it so it went deeper into her lovely bossom. Her smile wavered and hot, sticky blood  ran down her chest and stomach. She choked, then coughed, and blood sputtered from her mouth and stained her pearls of teeth. 

""I apologize sweetie, but my new job needs this to happen."" 

I made my way to the children, keeping the knife in my wife's body as she slumped to the ground, lifeless. I pulled out fishing wire from my other pocket and wrapped it around Issie's neck, pulling and tightening it until blood spurted. I then did the same to Nix.

""I love you all, but I needed a job and this job just so happens to perfectly suit my needs. I was tired of having to go through such pains to kill people. Now, I can do it all day, every day with a large pay. I do hope you can forgive me."" I reached for my phone on the counter and dialed my boss's number. When he answered, I told him the great news. 

""Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy,"" I repeated my wife's words in my head. Oh yes, this made me very happy indeed. "

Him and I had never quite seen eye to eye, and I always felt as if he resented me for being his brother’s best friend. Honestly, it was only at his brother’s funeral that he really opened up to me, and I think we really bonded over the memories we shared of his presumed to be dead brother.

See, my best friend had gone missing several weeks ago and it was only recently that the authorities had finally decided that all of their resources had been exhausted, and called off the search.

We both took it fairly hard, and I think that made us turn to each other for comfort, so when he invited me to go fishing with him I was more than happy to go.

But my enthusiasm clouded my judgement.

I should’ve been suspicious when he told me the cinderblock and rope were to make a makeshift anchor for the rowboat. 

I should’ve been quicker when he grabbed me by the feet and tied the other end of the rope to my legs. 

I should’ve been stronger and grabbed on to the side of the boat as he threw me overboard. 

They say that when you die your life flashes before your eyes, but instead I was greeted by a familiar face. Sure, the weeks underwater had distorted his features a little, but I would recognize the face of my best friend anywhere.

I always figured I would die with my mind at peace, but in the last moments before my world turned black, my mind was aflame with a burning question.

How did he know that this is where I left his brother, when I took him to the lake, all those weeks ago."

**Don’t.** 

&#x200B;

I know that feeling. You think something is there that shouldn’t be, so you look to make sure everything is fine.  

For most people, they are all safe and sound. Nothing unusual. 

And then there’s the unlucky bunch.  

I’ve felt the eerie feeling of someone breathing heavily around me. I know the thumping sound I hear while I’m home alone. It’s chilling. That’s why I had to look. I had to. I couldn’t stand not knowing what was in the room. I *wanted* to be aware. That’s why I did it. 

I made a mistake.  

The creature appeared to be a female. Once I looked, her weeping became louder. Blood seeped out of the holes where her eyes were supposed to be. The dark shape of her wide mouth engulfed my vision.  

I looked away as fast as I could. I knew it was still there. So why did I want to look again? 

You would think I learned from my mistakes. You’re wrong.  

I made another. 

This time, the figure was even worse than the last. Too horrific to describe. Trying to forget about a terrifying image in your mind is easier said than done. Took me a while to get used to it. 

It’s quite difficult trying to walk in a way where you never have to look behind you. But even if you never look again, you know something is there. Knowing always makes it worse. 

I make sure to never look at mirrors (just in case) and walk a certain way. I'm not entirely sure if they will hurt me, but I'm not taking any chances. People always give me weird looks. They don’t even know. 

I wish that I could end this here. Me never having to think of them again, you just ignoring what I have been saying this whole time.

His parents argued often, but never this bad. One shattered glass later, he bolted for his room. He stuffed his face into the pillow, pulled the blanket to block out everything, and cried until he passed out from the exhaustion. 

He woke up, emptied of emotions. The house was dead, but for the scuffling noise emanating from inside the ceiling above him. Rats. He imagined enormous, cat-sized rats running in the large gap between the ceiling and the floorboard, stealing his sweets, making those horrifying drumming noises. He heard the floorboard creaked, a few muffled bangs, and everything went quiet again. His parents' room was above his, so they must have heard the rats too, and banged on the floors to scare those creepy rodents away. All was well. 

Crawling out of bed, he walked tentatively to the kitchen for some water. He poured himself a glass, drained it, then poured two more to take to his parents. 

To his surprise, only his dad was in. Dad lay silently on his bed, his stare fixed on the ceiling. The room was a mess - bed moved out of its usual place, pushing the carpet up off of the floor, where pillows and cushions lay scattered. Dad sat up when he heard him come in, and a pained smile almost formed on Dad's face when he saw the two glasses of water on the tray. 

'Hi Daddy, I thought you might be thirsty...', he said, carefully surveying his Dad. 

'Cheers buddy, leave them on the the table for me, and come here', Dad replied. His voice hoarse and shaky.

Dad openned his arms, and he jumped right in.

'Where's Mummy?', he asked.

'She's...just gone...gone out. But...she's not far away, don't worry buddy.'

'Are you still angry Daddy? Please don't be angry. I love you.'

'I love you too, buddy.'

'Thank you for chasing the rats away. I heard them running inside the ceiling when I was in my room. I was really scared. But I'm not anymore.' 

'Right...right...yes I scared the rats away. They are gone now. Now, close your eyes, it's bed time.'

He smiled, closing his eyes as his Dad hugged him, more tightly.

...

He woke up again. The room was pitch black, and cold. The bed was too hard to be his usual bed. He tried to sit up, and banged his head on something solid. It knocked him back down. He reached around for something, anything. 'A hand', he thought, as he clutched on to some cold, hard fingers. He knew those fingers, but he couldn't tell whose fingers they were. He was too tired to think, too weak to try anymore.

...

Two weeks later, the local news ran a disturbing story on its front page of a missing family of three  abandoning their home, which reeked of foul stench, and rats were rapidly taking over. "

Useless for farming, so no one lives here. No one lives here, so the enemy never patrols here. Perfect for training and planning. Roughly made cottages served as barracks and prisons.

""You must confess,"" the gunman said. ""We can do nothing for you or with you until you speak."" They didn't send a sadist to take me out into the stony valley. The gunman was a sad man, with a long face and a bent back. He was on loan from one of the eastern brigades, so that my friends wouldn't have to torture me. Helpless I sat, tied off to a wooden chair while waiting.

""For the love of God-"" I say, but I cut myself off. It will do no good. 

That first day, he beat me. With fists and open hands at first, hoping to sting me into quick confession. ""You must confess,"" he'd say, before the blow. No man could be shot without a confession, and no torture permitted until they had overwhelming evidence of treason. Those were the rules.

I ducked my head between the blows and but did not confess.

That night, I ate barley bread and thin soup. It was as good as the soldiers training outside my cottage got. My old friends would see me dead, but never starved.

The next day the sad gunman used a knife. I tried not to scream too loudly; I did not wish to force my friends outside to listen to it. The thick metal tore my feet and arms to shreds.

The sad man looked bitter as he washed the blood off in a pail of freezing water.

The next day, the sad man came again. He held a pair of pliers in one hand and a can of bleach in the other. ""You must confess,"" he said.

I did. I told him nothing he hadn't heard of before; how the enemy took my daughter into their prisons and offered me her safety in exchange for information. How I'd given up two friends to enemy ambush and given up the guns cached in town.

""I'm sorry,"" I said.

""I know,"" the sad man said.

""No,"" I said. ""I'm sorry for you. I didn't mean to make you hurt me.""

The sad man nodded. He looked older than he had three days before. ""I did not enjoy it.""

""I was ashamed. I never meant to play the traitor.""

The sad man took out his pistol. ""Very few men do. Thank you.""

Old prayers ran through my mind. I bowed my head and mumbled through every one of them, one by one, with my eyes clenched shut."

Her binge lasted twice as long as normal, given her boyfriend's recent disappearance, and the hotel manager was one call away from dialing the police on a passed out guest in the lobby.

The speed slows from sixty to thirty as the highway runs through the small town of Jewel. Which is really only a market and a gas station lit up by a few white hot lights that rather than helping, offset the forest surrounding into further pitch.

A truck is parked on the left shoulder, at the end of the gas station. Other than that the stretch is empty. Normally I'd be nervous, being a girl in her mid twenties driving a car from the mid nineties, but instead I'm curious. The driver is leaning over the side of the truck bed. His appearance isn't anything out of the ordinary -- plaid shirt, cowboy hat, in his sixties. But what he's doing doesn't match. He holds a camera with an insanely huge lens. Something even over the top for a Nat Geo photographer. And he's fixated on something across the highway.

I follow his frame to see a white figure running along the right shoulder, traveling my same direction. 

A reflex in me presses my foot to the gas to speed up. I get closer and see that it's a person, naked and caucasian, running barefoot on the wet highway. And something is fucking off about it -- its arms are too long and it's not using them to run. It holds them loosely down at its side. 

I've cleared Jewel and now only my bouncing headlights illuminate its body. My reflex is still pushing the gas pedal. I'm almost up on its line of sight when a horrible thought creeps in, I look at my speedometer to see how fast I'm going -- fucking fifty. No way.

I look back at it, coming up on it's bald, hairless appearance. Something about its face shape looks familiar. A queer desire burns in me to see it -- to looks in its eyes. Its head begins to slowly turn toward me. Its eyes look caverenous and deep but I'm not quite there. I want to see it, I want to know. But a voice in my head says ""MEREDITH, DON'T!""

I listen. I fucking floor it and bend the corner. I almost lose control but I regain it on another stretch into the darkness. I'm at seventy-five now and I'm not stopping until the hotel in Seaside. I need to grab my sister as quick as possible because that thing is on its way."

They looked for people with below-average IQ. We volunteered as guinea pigs, they selected us. 4 men, 3 women. They put microchips into our brains that were supposed to stimulate different regions and bring our brains into harmony.

This effect they tried to establish was similar to what you hear about twins, who, no matter how far they are apart, feel what the other one feels. We were just 7 strangers, shortly afterwards we were connected like twins.

„The wave“ connects human brains like a computer network: one computer uses only part of its capacity, and a second computer logs in over the network, taking advantage of the spare capacity of the first computer. But instead of computers, „the wave“ uses human brains.

In the beginning, it only worked when some of us slept. The participants that were awake could then access the ""computing capacity"" of the sleeping one. Our average IQ increased by 10% in the first few weeks for each sleeping idividual.

After a while, it was not even necessary for someone to sleep to make the others smarter.

Then the hallucinations started. We began to see things that were not real. They suspected side effects from the unusual stress. They were too stupid to realize that we could see what the sleeping ones among us dreamed.

They decided to remove the chips, but it did not stop. Our brains had converged on each other so much that we stayed connected without any technical aid. We decided that the best we could do was to get as far away from each other as possible, so we spread across the country, then across the globe. But the bond between us was too strong. We started to hear each other's thoughts, constantly, everywhere, no matter where we were. „The wave“ was so strong now that even people who did not participate in the experiment became connected to us as soon as they spent too much time near us. It spread like the hypha of a fungus. The more became connected, the harder it became to recognize the line between our thoughts and tought of another one.

We figured out the best solution was to isolate ourselves and work on a way to disconnect us.

So we went to a vacant military base. Miles away from any human being, so that the network does not spread further. Proximity only made our connection stronger.

We were 7 strangers. Then we were 7,312. Now we are 1.

I am the wave."

All you have to do is set some bait and wait. Now, that bait can be anything. A mating call. A plastic turkey. It doesn’t matter as long as it catches their attention. 

Turkeys are just animals. Stupid animals. 

But don’t wait for too long. Get back home before darkness falls. And if you are unable to, make sure that you have some extra bullets just in case. 

Because you might run into something. 

Something that isn’t an animal. 

Or even human. 

Something that is very, very hungry.

It's hard to break the tradition of serving the classic turkey for Thanksgiving. They're tasty, they're popular, and they make Thanksgiving, well, Thanksgiving.

But as a former farmer, I have a bit of a story to tell. I used to raise quite a few animals, including cows, pigs, and- you guessed it- turkeys. It was a easy job sometimes, it was a hard job sometimes. But I couldn't complain much.

That's when the first oddity happened. One of my turkeys was... different from before. It continued to act normally, and it's appearance mostly didn't change. Mostly.

But after I glimpsed something odd about one of them, I couldn't help but notice something different about it. The black, soulless eyes I was used to staring at me had changed. They had been replaced with a dark gray color: about 5% brighter than the other turkeys. I thought it was neat, and instantly disregarded it.

A few days later, it happened again with one of the cows. It's eyes were also gray-ish, but this time they were a bit brighter than the turkey's eyes. When I went to the turkey, I noticed it's eyes had grown slightly brighter than the last time I checked it.

A few days later, about 1/6 of the total animals on my farm had brighter eyes. This time, they were around a light gray color. I was getting pretty worried at this point, so I looked up the problem on Google. According to Google, it was possible it was a disease, but last time I checked diseases don't make eyes glow at night.

It wasn't until half of the animals were ""infected"" that I realized their personalities were changing, too. They would either outright ignore me or come running up to me, pecking or biting at my legs. Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. 

Their eyes, dear god, their eyes. They had gone to a full, white shine; their eyes glowing through the windows at night like little bright flashlights. I didn't know what was happening anymore. But I still had one last theory left.

Miraculously, about 3 of my animals were left, their eyes still a grim black. With a permanent marker, I drew a star on one of the turkeys. I know, I shouldn't have, but I just needed to make sure.

The next day, their eyes were flashlights, and the star was gone.

I don't know what was happening, or how it was happening, but *those were NOT MY ANIMALS.*

Allow me to ask you this question again, trying to be a bit more specific.

When was the last time you had a *real* Thanksgiving turkey?"

I wasn't in a hurry because the call I got didn't seem pretty severe. It wasn't an infestation, and I was glad of that. She didn't have a boyfriend and her parents live across the country. She could have called the exterminator but he wouldn't have listened. She was always afraid of bugs anyway. She gave me a call that morning and started shouting in my ear about a house centipede and said that there was a big one in her house. It was unlike anything she had seen before. She also said there was a mother in a nest in her guest room, which wasn't a problem. Women exaggerate a lot about things, so I took this gigantic house centipede with a grain of salt.

I walked up to the door and knocked and she answered quickly. She looked scared to death because her face was deathly pale and her eyes were sunken in.

""Where is it?"" I asked nicely.

""Upstairs, come, quickly, before it goes away."" She said and walked me upstairs. She pointed into a room and I walked in. I saw the son of a bitch in the corner and it was huge. Maybe the size of my hand. I got my foot ready and a squashed that mother to a pulp. I got guts all over my shoes and even on my face and shirt, but it was dead.

I turned around and saw my ex wife standing there oddly.

""Well, it's dead now."" I said and showed her. ""I'll clean up the mess.""

""That was the mother."" She said shakily and my blood went cold.

""Where's the father then?"" I asked.

I saw her smile slightly, and then, her stomach started to move slowly.

Very slowly."

Today I decided to go grab a few bottles, as I had 10 more minutes before I'd get going to catch the bus and go to my boyfriend's place.


I had no pockets on my clothes and had to carry the keys and the bag, so I didn't take my phone, forgetting that the automated hallway lights turn off much quicker than they used to, since the last time the setup broke and had to be fixed.


The basement in my building is split into 4 bigger sections, which are further split into smaller sections for each apartment. Conveniently, our basement room was in the section nearest to the stairs, but the lightswitch next to it has been taken off from the wall completely and it's yet to be replaced.


I exit the elevator on the ground floor, walk the flight of stairs to the basement, unlock it and turn on the lights inside just as the hallway lights turn off. I go and grab what I need, when suddenly I remember that I have no idea how to go back upstairs.


The problem is I'm the biggest scaredy cat ever, and it's dark. I've never been particularly afraid of our basement, nothing weird has ever happened there, but I always felt weird going there. Like I was disturbing something or someone.


Just as I start planning (run upstairs, turn the lights on, run back down, collect your stuff, lock the door, run back up), the lights turn on. Hurray, a neighbour!


Happy I didn't have to complicate this simple task because of my anxiety and avid imagination, I climb the stairs to the ground floor to see the elevator still there. Weird, since I guessed the person who turned the lights on was either leaving their apartment or coming home; but the elevator was motionless and there was no noise whatsoever.


This creeped me out, considering the building is not very large but is tall, so the halls are very acoustic, so it's impossible not to hear even the smallest noise. Who turned on the light then?


I did the most logical thing I could think of - I ran into the elevator, pressed the button and anxiously waited for it to drag me up to the 6th floor. I hurried to our apartment and burst in. 


""That was quick"", my mother said and got up to move the bottles from where I put them down. I felt my shoulders and jaw relax with relief. 


I put on my jacket and looked for my scarf and backpack while explaining to her where I was going, laughing at myself for being silly.


I quickly looked at the mirror to see am I presentable on my way out the door, and I could swear my reflection blinked a fraction of a second slower than I did. "

Yet another day in his profession. A profession that he took great pride in.  A profession, he thought, that was unique in that it only existed for a few decades.  He thought about how it started, with a dog named Moby.  

“Moby the Infinite!” screamed headlines.  A dog that existed in infinite universes, now traversable to the human race.  Every Moby genetically the same, but with different outcomes of life.  Some Mobys caught bad luck and died as a pup while others became household best friends.  

Of course, Mr. Conner thought, humans would eventually find a way to use this bee technology.  Psychology itself turned inside out to abuse the system.  Ever wonder how Moby would respond to a certain stimulus? An experiment was made.  “How does Moby reflect every dog?” they asked.  

Within a few years rules were set up, to test individuals in infinite versions to see how they react. To better understand the psyche of animals. Then humans.  Humans could figure out what life influences cause somebody to be successful or poor, a paragon or a killer.  Nature versus nurture on steroids.  

But of course people had to play the parts.  People needed to sign up for their infinite versions to be tested and even more needed to play actors to be the influencers.  Of course the more unknowing the individual tested the better the results.  The more real the results.

Mr. Conner was an actor.  He had done a few parts, but his current was his biggest yet.  In that he felt pride, so he continued to do his best to be as convincing as possible.  

Even still, he took no pride in hard jobs where he hurt people's feelings.  Every influenced, good or bad, had to be tested after all.  Mr. Conner just sighed and continued doing what he did best, and best he was.

So after a few decades he was given an extremely important role.  And today was yet another crucial day in this individual's life.

Mr. Conner grabbed his outfit, finished his bottle of whiskey and headed to the machine to send him to a universe far away.  In mere moments he stood outside the door of a quiet house in a suburb somewhere in Wisconsin.

He opened the door to see a small boy in front of a broken vase.  Teary eyed and red faced.

“Daddy I'm sorry!” Cried his son.

I Woke up in darkness. I could feel and I coud hear, but I couldn´t move.

I felt soft fabric all around me, I heard a mechanical *beep, beep, beep* near me. I couldn´t even open my eyes to figure out where I was. And I didn´t remember anything before waking up.

I heard creaking, a door opening, I heard some voices, two I thought.

""Tell me nurse, is this the man you were talking about?"" said a male voice.

""Yes doctor, this is him"" a female voice answered.

They were talking about me. I tried as best as I could to tell them I could hear them, but no luck, my lips wouldn´t move.

""Tell me about him"" said the doctor.

""Name: Maxwell North, age: 28, single, no relatives, no girlfriend, no nothing. He´s perfect"".

Perfect? Perfect for what? I was starting to get nervious.

I tried to ralionalize my fear, to think. I was in a hospital, that was clear enough. And these people were a doctor and a nurse, maybe they were making their rounds or something, I calmed myself down and tried to listen at what they were saying, to see if I could get some answers.

""I´ll determine if he is a viable candidate, tell me his status"" the doctor spoke.

""The car accident cause major brain damage, but his body has mostly recovered. All the specialists say he will be brain dead at any moment"".

Car accident? Brain dead? What were they saying?! I couldn´t remember anything!

I felt my heart beating faster.

What had happened to me?

And what were they planning to do to me?!

I tried desperately to say something, to move, to blink! but it was useless, everthing was useless. I was at their complete mercy.

I tried to calm myself down again, these were people devoted to help the sick and injured, surely they were talking about some experimental therapy or surgery. And if that's what it was, they were are bound to do some other tests to me, and realize that I am awake, that I will recover.

That small moment of hope vanished when I heard the doctor's next words. Words that sent wave after wave of unimaginable terror down my body. I started crying desperately in my head, without even being able to shed tears.

""Perfect nurse, he does qualfiy.""

""Pass me the scalpel; I'm gonna make an abdominal incision, open him up, and then we´re gonna start eating""."

I look up at my mother with tears in my eyes, my too-red lips pressed together. Beautiful, she says. And today, the most beautiful, on my special day. 



Mother, brimming with her own tears, continues to pluck about my white dress, straightening out lace layers and precious pearls - I sit still, letting the woman painting my makeup on do her work, the other woman brushing and pinning my hair in place, hers. My eyes stare straight ahead, unable to focus. 



I am a nervous wreck. My special day. 



My dress lays around me as I sit cross-legged on the floor, made only for me and my one-of-a-kind lovely figure, perfectly pinned into each tidy place it could tuck on my curvature. There is no room for error on such an important day like this! My place at the altar later would have every eye turned on me, and I am determined to let that future hold. Today is for me, but more importantly, for us.



“All done, sweetheart! You look positively ravishing.” The girls coo and sway against one another, small squeaks and murmurs as they lay their eyes all over me, swallowing me up in their irises. I can’t - 



I can’t - 



I can’t look around, my nerves are on fire. 



Today has to go perfect! For us!



“Time to go! Let’s get you to that church.” My mom weeps, tears of pride as she takes my manicured hand and leads me away from the dressing rooms. Each of the women who enhanced my beauty dance out of the room, eager to find their places in the church to watch. The choir begins. Hymns rise, that are reserved for a woman like me on her special day, a day of new beginnings, of promises.



I walk up the center aisle alone, slowly, staring straight ahead. The priest smiles, his altar laid in white, his prayer books open in anticipation. I stop in front of the altar, beautiful, shining, in white. 



The ceremony has officially begun.



“Today, we gather at the altar to give a gift to the gods, in return for another bountiful harvest, the most beautiful girl in our city. Lay down, young lamb.”"

She always said the easiest way to handle kids - especially around the holidays - was to give them each a little responsibility.

""I thought you said you invited him,"" dad questioned, whispering over the sink. ""He's your brother, you should be together for Thanksgiving.""

I put another dish in the drying rack and selected a serving spoon to soap up. ""I did. He came over last night.""

""And?""

""We talked.""

He snorted, rolling his eyes. I could tell he would have pressed me further if mom hadn't corralled us back for dessert.

The entire family stood and clapped, thanking me for providing such a lovely meal. They'd done most of the ""I'm thankful for's"" when I'd been carving by the serving table, and now requested that I finish the tradition.

""Alright, alright,"" I began, urging them to sit, at least. ""I'm thankful for my wonderful family.""

Aw's went around, but a younger cousin spoke up, calling my thankfulness a cop-out. Laughter soon spread throughout the room, as it usually did when the little sucker cracked a wise one.

""More specific, then?"" I asked, gaining nods. ""Well, I'm sure most of you know David and I hadn't been getting along so well lately. Since he stole my wife and all,"" I chuckled, the only sound in the immediately tense room.

""I suppose some of you think I wouldn't invite him tonight,"" I continued, ""but he received the invitation and accepted. Even made a joke about how I'd try to poison the turkey or wine, the kidder!""

A few relatives swallowed hard. Others put down their glasses.

""I hope you wouldn't think so low of me."" I teared up a little. My relationship with all my family members had changed forever when I'd caught David with Vanessa. My only solace came in knowing she'd wound up leaving him for another man not too long afterwards.

The tears seemed to do their job. ""If anyone,"" I explained, ""knows anything about family, it's me. No matter the fights, no matter the differences, you always, always keep family close.""

The ones who'd put down their wine now raised them once more, ready for my toast. Which I then delivered perfectly.

""And if you can't keep them in your hearts,"" I smiled, ""you can put them in your stomachs."""

I try to cry but no sound comes out. Cool water runs over my body. I ache as it penetrates my frozen skin. Soft paper is pressed into me, drying me. I’m being moved again. The same hands scrub something into my skin. It stings. I’m so disoriented. 

*Are we doing stuffing this year?* A voice over head asks.   
 *No mommy, I hate stuffing.* A child’s voice?   
 A soft chuckle, *Okay no stuffing.* 

The female voice hums. Minutes pass, hours maybe. I’m fading in and out of consciousness. Suddenly, course, sturdy hands yank me up. These hands feel familiar. I think they’re the ones that brought me to this place. My arms are twisted painfully behind my back. Crossing my limbs under the wings of my shoulder blades, I feel rough twine twisted around my wrists. My legs are given the same treatment. Twisted roughly under me and secured with more twine. 

What is happening? Only a week ago I was out in the cold sunshine, enjoying a crisp November day. 

I’m rolled onto my back again. The same rough hands work with the softer pair to move me to some sort of metal container. There’s a liquid at the bottom, something floats in it. I can feel pieces of it bump against me. A light brush traces some type of oil, or slick liquid over my skin. It is almost soothing. I feel like I should be panicking. Something is very wrong, but I am so tired, and the brush feels so soft. The warmth of the room is finally sinking through my skin. Another great lurch and I think I am being carried. 

*Be careful.* Says the female voice.  
*Well, it IS a bit heavy dear.* A gruff manly voice spat out.  
*I’m not the one who chose it.* She chided. 

They push me and the metal bath into something very warm. Hot actually. My skin feels like it's blistering. Suddenly there’s a sharp pain in my side. Something is pushed into my stomach. I whimper. I can feel my face again. I use all my might to pry open an eye and look down, it’s a meat thermometer. I look up. My reflection stares back at me in horror. I’m in an oven, my hairs been hacked off, but I know it’s me. I try to pull free of the twine cutting painfully into my wrists.

*I think she’s fighting the sedative.* The female laughs.

I can feel the prick of a needle in neck. My head grows light again. I’m fading. 

*Can’t have her ruin the main course, now can we?* the man chuckles.

Back in college, when I had a ground level apartment, plenty of people (read: other idiot students) would sneak onto our patio area and write messages in the condensation. You know the drill, bullshit like ""I see you"" or a smiley face, or some stoned/drunk declaration of love or hate. 
But that was in college. 

I'm 23 now, I have an apartment with my boyfriend. It's not the nicest place ever, but it's okay. One bedroom, one bathroom, a kitchen, and three windows. One of the windows is over the kitchen sink, it's about half a foot wide, and it's permanently painted shut. From the outside, it doesn't even look like a window. One is the window that lets out to the fire escape, it's close to 5 feet tall, but narrow, and the fire escape rattles whenever we accidentally slam it closed.

The last window is what I have a problem with. It's not a real window, I guess- it's a skylight. We live on the top floor, and before the building became a shitty apartment complex, the roof was a greenhouse with really nice, thick, glass plated floors. Most of it got redone, but it was totally see through. Now though, there's no greenhouse, and it's a convenient spot to watch the rain, or stargaze. Until yesterday, when I took a nap on the couch, and noticed words on the skylight. 
Words that said ""I love you, I have always loved you. I watched you, I will always watch you. I want you, I will have you.""

The fire escape outside doesn't reach the roof, and the skylight only opens from the inside of our apartment. My boyfriend is out of town, visiting his sister's new baby. 

The problem I have with the writing on my skylight, is that it was written *left to right*."

Everyone who lives here is either dangerous or looks very shady. 

The reason I think my neighborhood is cursed is because when one person dies, two more follow. I don't know when it started but whenever someone died everyone was scared, holding their breath waiting for two more people to die as well. At first I thought it was a coincidence. It's winter and old people get sick. But every year more and more people die. It's never one person that dies, it's always three. This October 12 people died. Nobody knows why this happens but everyone id always on edge on winter and sometimes summer too. 

Two people died this week. Can anyone tell me what's going on? My dad is getting sick. I don't know what to do. "

Do you drive? If so, you should get a dashcam. 

A dashcam is the term for a set of video cameras around your car that you can review later in the case of an… ‘accident’ 

&#x200B;

I installed mine last year.

The video feed came in handy when a blue Audi driven by a learner driver smashed into me. He had scared eyes and inexperienced feet. It was only 15mph but I took his details, I was going to get the money to fix my car.

&#x200B;

Reviewing the footage was when everything changed. 

&#x200B;

The people on the curb, waving. That was the change. I won my case; the waving people never came up. But I knew they weren’t there when the kid hit me. 

&#x200B;

I knew deep down who the waving people were, but I had to be sure.

&#x200B;

My heart fluttered as I drove by the A168 turn off. It’s a shit piece of national infrastructure and the 18 car / lorry pile up that happened there was inevitable. Only 9 people died though, a miracle of modern automotive safety. 

&#x200B;

Watching my dashcam footage that night my nerves needed a large whiskey. Nine smiling blank eyed people on the road side. Two sets of them holding hands, all waving at me. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t tell anyone about the waving people. I have been going through a tough time myself and they would just think that I had lost my grip. See soon after the bump from the stupid learner, my Fiancé died on the road. 

I wish I could blame a drunk, but no. Just a poor decision on a very fast bit of road. Dead. Dead. Dead. Alone. Alone. Alone. 

&#x200B;

I drive along that stretch of road every single day. My dashcam records things my weary eyes can’t see. Watching it back at night, my third large whiskey in hand as my Fiancé waves to me. Each and every fucking time, she smiles and beckons me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That changes today.

I drunk a whole bottle this time, I don’t want this to hurt. 

It feels odd driving without a seatbelt on, my car is sluggish with all the extra weight I loaded in the back. 

I approach the spot she died at, matching the traffic going 80mph.  

One deep breath and I close my eyes. I turn the steering wheel to a hard lock and physics takes over.

That was the promotion our store ran every Thanksgiving for the last 17 years. Well, for as long as I’ve been here, that is. 

But not this year 

This year, we’re not running a promotion. I really can’t blame them, after what happened last year

Let me tell you what happened

First off, my name’s Jim, I’m the Meat Manager here at Barnaby’s. I saw it all

It was two days before Thanksgiving, I was working the morning shift. 

We just received our truck, but unfortunately, the turkeys we ordered, were out of stock from the warehouse. For those of you that don’t know what that means, it means the warehouse didn’t have any to send us. 

“Shit!!! This isn’t good.”

I went to the case to see how many we actually had. All we had was one. One lone turkey. 

“Fuck!!!”

Then it happened. 

From opposite ends of the aisle came two women. One, an older Asian women and Two, a younger blonde, Barbie wannabe. 

They both arrived at this case at the same time. I informed them that this was the last turkey we had due to the warehouse issue. 

Their eyes widened with fear and shock as they both turned to the freezer case door. 

The Asian women grabbed the door and flung it open, hitting “Barbie” in the face and knocking her back. “Barbie” screamed like some kind of demon, charged and grabbed “Asian” by the hair, spinning her around, and slamming her head first into the adjacent glass freezer case door. 

Barnaby’s is a very old store, we still have actual glass freezer doors. 

Anyway, a few seconds went by and “Asian”  crawled out of the case and turned. Pieces of glass were stuck in her face, arms and neck, she was bleeding like a pig. 

Covering the wound in her neck, she grabbed a piece of glass from the case, screamed, and charged “Barbie” as she was lifting the turkey out of the case. She drove that piece of glass directly into “Barbie’s” heart. 

They both fell to the floor. As well as the turkey, which rolled halfway down the aisle. 

I guess one of the customers, who wasn’t videotaping on their phones or a manager or someone called the cops. They showed up and closed the store down. 

The paramedics showed up, did their thing, as the employees moved any customers to the front for checkout. 

As I was walking back to make sure there were no more customers, I saw the paramedics covering the bodies with white sheets. 

They died, right there, in Aisle 12. 

I saw the turkey still laying there on the floor. I picked it up, paid for it, and brought it home to me family

My wife cooked it up, and we had a amazing Thanksgiving dinner

The best part was the turkey. 

Yeah....that thing was to die for. "

My mother, my little sister and I had fled north, where it was colder, the virus could not spread so quickly. I still remember the first reports about the effects of the virus. Pictures of abandoned streets. People in yellow suits removing corpses. A few months later, there were some pictures as the dead began to come back. After that, there was no more television and the news on the radio eventually disappeared.

The virus had killed a large part of the people immediately. Many of those who were immune or could run away from the virus like we did, fell victim to the Returnees, as we called them. With most of humanity wiped out, the rest of society fell apart like a house of cards. We were able to hide for a while in remote forests. I took care of my sister when Mum got supplies.

Mum was a faithfull believer and always told us that God would take care of us and show us the way. She believed the Returnees were a form of demon God had sent to punish humanity for it’s sins.

One day, Mum decided that it would be too dangerous for the three of us to travel alone and that it would be better to find a group to join. We found such a group 2 month later.

Ark, that‘s what the inhabitants called their settlement. A small community surrounded by high walls. The leader, a man only called Father, was warmly welcoming us.

Every day began with a divine service. We heard about the love and grace of God. After that we went to work on the fields.

Father regularly called Mum to join his ""private prayer"". She never told me what happened, but about that time I started to hear Mum crying when she thought my sister and I were sleeping.

One day after one of those ""private prayers,"" Father came to me and said that Mum had fallen heavily and died of her injury. He tried to comfort me by saying, that she was in a better place now.

Once a caravan came by to trade. I saw Father open the gate and my sister and several other women went out to the men. Then the gate closed again.

She did not come back.

Years passed.

Yesterday a man came to the gate. He said that this one is the last settlement where he met people. It may well be that this place got the name Ark for a reason. Maybe we are all that's left of humanity.

As I write these lines, I am sitting on the watchtower beside the gate, in the distance the Returnees approach.

Throughout the years, faith has sustained me that God has a plan. And now it's clearer than ever how his plan looked to me. I see his demons approach the gates of this ark.

And I will open these gates."

So they aren't, we move forward year after year dull holiday after dull holiday. My family has some very interesting holiday traditions but Thanksgiving is the most important. 

You see my ancestors came here on the Mayflower ship, they arrived in Cape cod in November of 1620. They were settlers of Massachusetts and they took part in the first Thanksgiving after a successful fall harvest in 1621. However my pilgrim ancestors were very strange. 

Like many other pilgrims they were suspicious and frightened of things they didnt understand. Joseph White one of my ancestors was a bad bad man. He ate with native Americans one day and slaughtered them the next. He accused his niece eventually of being a witch and would make sure she burnt for it. He served meals at the first Thanksgiving to young girls he would molest later. 

He was a bad man and the rest of the family including his wife were not any better. When They burnt their own niece alive it was Joseph's wife Mary who lit the flame. This man and this woman who when faced with their own immortality chose to seek out help from both types of people they despise the witches and the native Americans.

They made a deal to leave Plymouth, by this team other local pilgrims were not so kind on them either seeing as how Joseph and Mary's 16 year old son was raping half the village at night. It was the witches who came to call for them. Wickedness begets wickedness I guess. The witches told them to leave go 7 days away from the village and live how they wanted and they would live long and when the time did come for death the witches magic would save them, but for only one day and night a year forever more.

Only the deal only works if the whole family is together on Thanksgiving, so every year we travel up near Massachusetts and we park off the road near the forest and we walk deep within to a small family plot hidden in the trees and we feast. They are intimidating people with strange customs and a strange way of talking but we must obey the gift they were given for if not we burn on Thanksgiving forever and always. 

The witches gift or curse rather came with one catch every 25 years we sacrifice a member of the family to them feeding their soul to the witches so the curse burns on. It must be done or the whole bloodline burns forever in hell. I'm so scared, so so scared. I have to do this they are counting on me, this year is a 25th year and I'm the guest of honor for Thanksgiving this year."

The voice led me off the trail, where my flashlight's beam fought a losing battle against the night. I ran as fast as an overweight, 40 year old biologist could without stumbling over the roots and shrubs.  ""HELP! HELP! HELP!"" It was close. But then the night fell silent, save for the crunching of leaves beneath me as I slowed my pace to a walk. 

I'd scarcely bent over to catch my breath when something rustled in the leaves overhead. I tilted my flashlight up. ""HELP!"" The voice from above damn near stopped my heart. A plump, brown-feathered bird with a face like a disgruntled cartoon owl glared at me from above. 

""HELP!"" It squawked. A new species. I'd heard of goats that bleated near-human speech, but this... this would surely give the boys back home something to talk about. That a birdcall would evolve to sound so much like a human's cry for help. 

""Just a fucking bird."" I chuckled, and drew my phone to take a picture.

The bird blinked, cocked its head to the side, and opened its mouth to squawk. ""Just a fucking bird,"" it repeated in my voice."

I am stuck here with others like me. In this small area, I go to the left, I go to the right.

There is this other big guy, and I’m afraid of him. He’s stronger than me and he is intimidating, so I run and hide. All I do is move around this place and hide from everything I’m scared of. 

When my captor comes, we always hide, but sometimes they drop food for us. We all struggle to get as much as we can. We are so hungry. Sometimes I get a lot. Even more than the big guy. Take that! 

My belly is really big, so big that I know I will have more than one child! I can’t wait. I’ve been waiting for a long time.

 Sometimes it gets dark, and then I get really scared because I can’t see anything. I just go to sleep, but I make sure to stay far away from the others.

Today I gave birth and I kept my children somewhere no one will find them. I am so hungry and scared. The one who took me to this place will come again. They don’t do anything to us but give us food and then leave. I don’t know why I’m here. I just want to go home with my children and feel safe again. 

I found out that the big guy ate my children. How could he do that? I can’t believe it. They were going to grow up here! I have already accepted that this is my new home. I will thrive here, but how can I do that when they are gone? What kind of sicko would do that to such innocent children? I am absolutely devastated. 

Another day has passed in here alone. There are these things around us that we can go through, I like to hide in them whenever I am scared.

 I look up and I see a dead corpse. I know what this means. Last time this happened, the scary guy came and took the body out of the place. We were scared he was going to hurt us It is so bad in here. There is poop everywhere. Sometimes the others eat their own poop. I can’t blame them because we get very hungry.

I am getting weak and I am starving. Maybe I will die like that other guy. I hate it here. There's nothing to do and we are all trapped. I can’t wait to die.

The time has come. I feel so light, it’s like I am floating. My eyes are wide open.

Crafts of a size we didn't know possible. The technology required to make such ships is... otherworldly. Which, of course, is suiting. We had no idea where the aliens came from, and they did not speak our language. I say aliens, and I do mean aliens, but they looked fairly similar to us. Bipedal. Slightly bigger. Two eyes, a nose, hair, and two arms, but their skin seemed... almost... washed out? It's the best way I can describe it. They didn't wear clothes like we did. I don't know how their garb was made, but, I hate to admit it, some of it was beautiful.

&#x200B;

Even though they didn't exactly look like us, I might even begin to say they acted human. They ate, they pooped and peed, they got sick, and they even laughed and smiled with each other as we do! 

&#x200B;

But they did not laugh and smile with us. Only malice did they have for us.

&#x200B;

We never fully understood why they attacked. Some of us even tried to make peace with offerings of precious metals and trinkets. I know one group that actually tried to worship the aliens as Gods. I opposed that, but nothing else would have worked, so we had to try everything.

&#x200B;

The aliens were quick and efficient with their onslaught. We tried to fight back but didn't have a chance. Our weapons were no match for their blasters. Those blasters... more unfathomable technology. We didn't even know what they shot! It was invisible! One moment, we'd be fighting vehemently to protect our wives and children, and the next we'd be lightheaded and bleeding out. As time went on we realized the plight was futile, those of us with nothing to lose carried on the fight helplessly, but most of us were forced to run. It was the only thing we could do.

&#x200B;

We left our homes. We were split up from our families in the confusion of the assaults. We had lost so many loved ones it drove many of us to melancholy and even suicide. We constantly lived in fear of the aliens, vagabonding around the desolate countryside desperately trying to make a new life for ourselves, but the aliens kept coming. They always found us. We were defeated.

&#x200B;

The aliens weren't always hostile to us. I cannot believe my naivety. Shortly after they arrived on their massive ships, we invited them into our homes. We had a rather nice dinner and we drank and we were merry. That fateful day. The day before the attacks. It's like they wanted to give us one last meal to enjoy with our families before the bloodshed began. The aliens celebrate that day every year, and they call it Thanksgiving."

Ever read Roald Dahl's ’, ‘Lamb to the Slaughter’? My professional life has been inspired by it. I’m a hit man who works for sources I can’t name here round the year. Except for a week before the holidays. Those days are reserved for pro bono work.

I also take the responsibility of making these bodies disappear. 

You might have already guessed it – my victims go into the Thanksgiving meals served at our parties. Every year. Like I said, it’s easier that way. My wife and kids don’t know about my profession. As far as they are concerned, I’m a medical sales representative who is very good at what he does. 

This year has had many ups and downs. I undertook many projects, which meant more travelling. I guess someone else cashed in on the time I spent away from home. My world was shattered when my wife announced that she had decided to leave me. Woman wants me to break it to the kids! It’s a good thing that she told me today. It’s easier this way, wouldn’t you agree?"

But today, I found a book that I had never seen before. It wasn't of tall tales, or far off lands. It was about me, or what I presume is me. It had as follows:

Oh Allison, dear Allison, how I enjoy you.

Every day I fear the light but hope;

that I shall stumble to;

the day the right;

with the blade of knife;

with how I will carry through.

I dream of said day

when this, your body;

is what I shall carry away.

The day of reckoning is tomorrow;

your hair I will steal

I shall not borrow.

The shops that lined both sides of the main street were dark and lifeless, waiting patiently for their owners to come and start their day. Walking from one end of this street, briskly and with purpose, was a man in a big coat. He liked walking through the town at this early hour, when it was quiet and empty. It gave him time to think. Time to clear his head and prepare for the busy day. He reached an intersection and pressed the button. Though there were no cars, no other people, he still liked the routine. Listening to the steady, slow beep of the crossing, he closed his eyes and waited for it to change. The stillness was peaceful and relaxing. Standing still, he started to feel that something was wrong. Something was changing. He could feel it in the pit of his stomach. Suddenly, the man flinched, startled at the sudden noise around him. He opened his eyes.

The first thing he noticed was the sky. It was lighter and much bluer than it had been a moment ago. Looking around, he saw that the street was now bustling with shopkeepers and customers. The fruit shop now had its products on display in boxes and baskets, forming mounds of yellow, green, and red.  Looking around, he saw that many people had been staring at him with fearful looks on their faces but had quickly looked away. The sudden loudness of the bustling street had eased, and he could now hear the buzzer beeping quickly. He began to cross the road, looking out of the corners of his eyes at the cars that were lined up at the intersection. Many of the occupants were staring at him with concerned looks on their faces, talking quietly to each other.

When he reached the other side, the man lifted his arm and looked at his watch. With a jolt of fear, he realised that he had lost an hour. What had he done in that time? Had he roamed the streets until he was back where he started, or had he stood still the whole time? He continued on down the street, trying to calm himself. Trying to feel normal again. Lost in his thoughts, he was brought back to reality by a loud car horn honking at the car in front of it. There was a line up of cars on the road next to him, and the car in front wasn’t moving. When he got near it, he stopped to look at the driver, who sat motionless with his eyes closed and his mouth hanging open. When he looked closer, he saw that the driver had blood trickling from his ears. The man stopped. With shaky hands, he touched his own ears. They were wet with blood. Just then, he felt it again.

“Oh yea, I see it.” The customer nods, feigning to understand the point.

“So what can I get you?” The butcher, setting his massive hands on his waist.

“Uhh..” Scratching his balding head.

“So?” The Butcher’s tone shifts. Eyeing down at the smaller man, he makes his dwindling patience obvious. “Today, maybe? It’s about closing time.” 

The man squints behind his glasses.“Uhh, one of those?” Pointing through the glass at a set of fresh strip steaks. The Butcher rubs his chin, “Well, you see, those are display cuts, but what I can do, is pull you a set from the back, fresh off the bovine. That sound good?” The big man’s tone adopting a cheery joy. 

“That’ll be fine.” The man, sounding proud of his choice. 

“Well, alright then!” Clapping his hands, he gathers his tools and heads to the back of the shop.

Nancy snaps awake. The cold biting deep into her bones. Glancing once again at her missing calf. Her shining ivory poking through the caked blood.

The heavy steel sliding door is ripped open. The silhouette of the Butcher nearly covering the portal. The heavy door grinds shut, it’s metallic lock resounding her doom.  

The gag chokes her slightly, restraints tighten. She reaches with her foot to a nearby knife,in futility. 

“We can’t have that.” Sliding in and kicking the knife away, grabbing a handful of her golden hair, the Butcher yanks her head back. 

Loss of blood tugs her back to sleep. His vile breath spills over her trembling lips “I just need a few more baby, then we can go home.” 

The gag tightens against her efforts to scream.

“Well here you go!” The butcher bursts out of the back room and slaps the steaks on the counter.  “Like I said, fresh off the bone.”

Small bells ring, signaling the customer leaving, “Closing time!” He booms, opening the empty cooler. 

“What the fu-” THUNK!

With the rest of her waning strength she slams a tenderizer against the Butchers temple. The shelves of the cooler shake as his massive body thumps onto the wet floor. 

Wet thumping echoes in the backroom. Spraying nearby equipment and painting the floor surrounding the pile of meat and gristle that once capped the Butcher’s hulking frame.

Finally free, Nancy collapses on the concrete just outside the butcher shop. 

“Oh my god! Are you alright?”  Her slow breath pushes hair out of her vision. Her eyes rest on a small balding man dropping what was stolen from her. "

So you can imagine the kind of horror that I went through every year during Thanksgiving. Hordes of relatives would descend upon our home. Followed by endless hours of teasing, debating, games, slurping and burping. My cousins, I was the oldest, would try to sneak into my room, admire my dresses and jewellery. Try to make me play with them. I try to mingle and be jovial for my parents’ sake. But that’s about it. 

This Thanksgiving’s eve, my home was extra noisy. My aunt had recently delivered a baby and he was bawling his eyes out. I really couldn’t stand it! So I snuck out of home. I kept walking until I reached the town outskirts. The sun had just set and I noticed the lights of a local fair in the distance.  Wandering about, I came across  a tent claiming to grant the deepest desires of the heart. I entered it to see an old woman sitting behind a desk. The room was filled with shelves full of potions and old books. A part of me was skeptic and another was enchanted by the setting. 

The old lady immediately looked into her orb and described me accurately; I could feel my skepticism dissolving. All I could do was nod, I hadn’t spoken since entering her tent. Finally, she asked me what I wanted. I was blank. Surely you can see what I want when you can make out what I am, I told her. She gave a knowing smile, her eyes twinkling. She gave me one of her potions. I refused to take it, not wanting to drink something suspicious in a dubious tent. Her eyes twinkled again - there was something about them - maybe to say that she knew what was best for me. How motherly! How could I have doubted her so! I felt my resolve fade against my will. I gulped down its contents, said a polite thank you and left.

The ground was silent and deserted. How much time had I spent in there? I hurried over to my home, hoping that my parents wouldn’t kill me. I tiptoed into my room and fell into a deep slumber. I woke up to a silent house next morning. Had this been my wish? Had it been granted? Or had I entered the wrong home? I ran down the stairs and into the kitchen where my mother was making tea. She looked quite worn out. She didn’t respond to me. Maybe she was angry for what I did yesterday. My aunt walked in with a two year old at her hip – wasn’t this the same infant who was crying yesterday. How did he grow... 

I tried to talk to them, to make my presence felt. It was all in vain. My entire family was there, all looking older. Looking solemn, like they were mourning. The table was silent as they ate Thanksgiving lunch. And I just hated the silence."

I pause a moment: by the front stands, lying sat upright, is a big yellow care-bear looking oddly out of place, like some exotic lion let out of its cage. When I say big, I mean really big, like maybe seven foot, the kind of mascot that would instead make a kid cry and run off if they tried to hug them. I laugh at that image. Then I look closer at the thing. Its eyes look freakishly human-like. There’s also some kind of reddish rust on its acid-yellow fur. I wouldn’t want to hug this guy, I thought, shaking my head.

I’m locking the security room when I get a call.

“Hey, Mark.” It’s from John. “You and Freya still coming round for dinner tomorrow night with Laure and I? Shame you couldn’t make tonight.”

“I’m looking forward to it already”, I reply.

“Oh, and how is the shift? Dreary, eh?”

“Tell me about it. How about that yellow bear as well?” I say, eying it through the security cameras. “You know, the big one with the staring eyes. It bloody well crept up on me, it did. You ever saw that thing around yourself before? John? You still on the line?”

Just then, there was a *crash*. I cursed, hanging up the phone, and went. Turned out it was only a couple of stands that had toppled over and, grumbling, I started clearing them up.

When I returned, I noticed two things. The first was that I had five missed calls, all from John. I sighed and made a mental note to call him back. The second thing that struck me was what was on the security camera footage, or, to be exact, what wasn’t there. The bear – it had, simply, gone. I was left scratching my head, but almost fell over when I heard a sudden and terrible screech. Its echo receded. Nothing else happened and I waited, tense. Then on the security cameras, I saw something move in the blink of an eye. 

I turned around, intending to go find the thing – only to, to my horror, lock eyes with it, standing in the room with me."

This was our first year celebrating Thanksgiving by ourselves—our kids had made other plans and our parents had all passed away. It seemed a little silly to cook a full turkey dinner for just the two of us, but I thought it might help to cheer him up.

I took my seat across from my husband, interlaced my fingers and bowed my head.

*Bless us, O Lord*

Something was wrong with his voice. It sounded a little gravelly, a little strange. Was he holding back tears perhaps? Was he that affected by us being alone this holiday? Keeping my head down, I lifted my eyes to check his face.

*And these, thy gifts*

He looked a little worse for wear. His eyes were sunken and his face was sallow. Was he sick? He seemed fine this morning.

I was staring now, no longer listening to the words. There was something about his lips…they weren’t moving right. My hands tightened as I attempted to hide the trembling that had taken over. 

Suddenly, my husband’s head shot up and his eyes locked on to mine. They were bloodshot, unfocused.

*Which she is about to receive* 

What did he just say?

I tried to ask what was going on, but the words would not come out. I tried to stand, to run away, but my body was frozen. I heard steps behind me, steps that also sounded wrong, and then something slid into my ear. Pain shot through my head but I did not scream, at least not out loud. 

*Through you, our Lord*

My husband did not react, did not even look at whatever being had infiltrated our home. He just kept staring straight at me, and me at him, and I noticed a pain behind his eyes that said he might be screaming too.

My vision faded as I felt something burrow into my brain. Before I lost consciousness, I felt my lips move and heard a voice that was not my own say,

*Amen* "

I continue to eat when my niece Ava, one of the few I actually like, whispers something to me. “You need to save me some ham.” she said in her cute little soft voice. I hate her dad, but i’ll be damned if she isn’t the most adorable thing.

&#x200B;

“Of course, sweetie!” I exclaim.

Every morning, she would come in to find a tack on her chair and her chalk missing. Every afternoon, spitballs would pepper her short, graying crop of hair as soon as she turned to write on the board. Every evening, a fresh scratch would be carved into the side of the car she drove to work. Worst of all, they were loud. Always screaming and laughing and shouting and carrying on.

The principal yelled and raged at the class weekly. The school superintendent scheduled behavioral meetings monthly for each student. 

Mrs. West never complained, never said a harsh word to anyone. Days, months passed and she continued to endure the disgusting behavior of the unruly students. The principal called her an angel. Other teachers called her a saint. 

One cold Monday morning, Mrs. West drove to work, like she always did. She brushed the tack off of her chair, like usual, and pulled out a fresh box of chalk to replace the ones missing from the blackboard. She turned to the class. “Today,” she said with a smile. “We are going to play a game.”

The class, for once, was silent. They never played games in Mrs. West’s class. 

The rules of the game were simple. No student was to make a sound rest of the class. If you made any noise at all, you would be sent to the principal’s office. The last student left would be excused from class for the rest of the week.

The students were excited. No class for a whole week? What a reward! 

The first ten minutes of class were absolute silence. Mrs. West sat at her desk, smiling, scanning the faces of her students. Suddenly, Robbie laughed.

Mrs. West jumped to her feet, and motioned Robbie to come forward. “No fair, Tim tickled me!” Robbie yelled, but Mrs. West simply shook her head and escorted him out of the class room. In a moment, she returned. Minutes later, Cindy coughed. She too was immediately pulled out of the room by Mrs. West. Bobby and Tim were next, for whispering, then Molly for asking to go to the bathroom, then Greg for sneezing.  

One by one, the students of Mrs. West’s classroom were removed from the room, with Mrs. West’s smile getting bigger with each missing student. Until finally, only little Betty was left. 

Mrs. West stood up. “Congratulations, Betty, you’ve won. Go on home, now.” Betty giggled and skipped out of the classroom. On the way, she swung by the restroom. 

When she pushed the door open, all she could do was scream.

Mrs. West still sitting in her classroom, smiling when the police arrived. The murder weapon was found, a knife soaked in blood, neatly tucked in the back pocket of her slacks.

For the rest of her life, little Betty never made another sound.

In their cloistered halls, whispered chants and catechisms echo in the air, heavy with incense.

They speak of the origins of pain, how the first life to crawl upon the earth suffered and writhed. How the ground scraped its fragile form, how the air burned with toxic fumes.

They chant their lament at the inescapable nature of agony, at the futility of beasts and birds and humans who strive to fortify themselves against it, only to inevitably fail.

Their sonorous voices reach a whispered crescendo, and the Sisters fall silent. The only sound comes from the guttering candles that line the great stone chamber.

Then a new chant begins, this one gentler, tinged with hope.

They speak of the finite nature of matter and energy, how all things, though they cannot be destroyed, can be transformed and channeled.

They sing of the binding of demons, of despicable criminals condemned to dark dungeons, of the devil himself, entombed in hell. 

Then their song darkens once more. In muted tones they chant of their duty. The terrible burden that is theirs: to seek out agony and to control it, to gather it together to spare the rest of humanity from its malign influence.

Beneath the Sister's habits are bodies riddled with scars and burns, open wounds left to seethe and fester, rubbed with salt and gouged with red hot iron, jagged splinters driven under bloody fingernails, hidden from sight by soft white gloves. 

The Sisters do their utmost to gather all the pain they can, to imprison it within their bodies. But their numbers have grown few, and they must remain strong enough to carry on their work. 

The people call them angels; scouring ravaged battlefields and plague stricken villages, bearing away the fallen to be ministered to. 

Many return healed, indebted the gentle Sisters. 

Many do not. Instead their families are told by hand wringing messengers that they could not be saved. 

The Sisters take some solace though, even in bearing this dreadful news.

Terrible as it may be, it is a vindication of their faith. Despite the anguish on the faces of mothers and wives and orphans when they learn of the loss of a loved one, there is always a moment, however fleeting, of relief when they are told that they did not suffer. 

So is their creed shown to be true. The Sisters can see the pain of grieving families exorcised by their deeds. 

For deep beneath the crumbling Abbey are the crypts, each cell home to a single denizen. Those for whom death is inevitable, but who can offer one last gift to humanity. Some are locked behind heavy iron doors, unable to flee when the sisters come to inflict their exquisite tortures. Some are too broken, and lay sprawled on the cold stone floor. 

The Sisters go about their duties with heavy hearts but unshakeable resolve. They know the righteousness of their cause. 

Pain is eternal, but it is not infinite. Though they may never succeed in gathering ever last mote of it within their walls, the Sisters will always strive. "

I walk over to Viv’s bowl. Our eyes meet. For the first time in all the years I’ve had her I notice that her eyes aren’t black, but a pale, beautiful pink.

I hesitate and look at the tiny book I found stashed behind her food; It’s incredibly small, the size of a Lego.At first I thought that it was one of my nephew’s toys but on closer inspection I realize that it is a diary. Viv’s diary.

I’m standing over her bowl now. She swims in circles for a moment before disappearing into the Pirate Ship Vessel Hiding Cave.

I don’t know what to say, I think I’m going crazy; but at the same time there’s no doubt in my mind that this isn’t a figment of my imagination.

*Viv’s diary, entry 15:*

*Andrew is feeding me that off- brand stuff again. It’s giving me acid reflux.*

*Viv’s diary, entry 22:*

*Andrew had a party, invited people over. Someone spilled something in my bowl. I don’t feel so well.*

*Andrew’s away. A nice girl came over to feed me while he’s gone. She actually talked to me and changed the water. I wish I could leave with her.*

*Viv’s diary, entry 28:*

*He is back. I don’t care what the label on the food says, he doesn’t ‘have his pet’s best interest at heart’.*

*I want to leave. I think if I jump high enough I can escape.*

*Viv’s diary, entry 30:*

*I almost died.* *I used the Ship thing and the water purifier to give me momentum, but I landed on the floor. I don’t know when he found me… but when I got to, I was back in the bowl, and two oxygen tablets were fizzing next to me.*

&#x200B;

She is looking at me from her hiding place. Her pink eyes are shining like two tiny gemstones.

I walk over to my bookcase, pick one with a beautiful painting on the cover and place it over the fishbowl.

“I don’t want you to go, Viv” I hear myself say, “I’ll get you the good stuff.”

Before I leave the apartment, I look over my shoulder; she is staring at me.

“Maybe a nice companion, too, huh? They say goldfish like company.”

I’m pretty sure I hear some kind of scream; but I chuckle.

Now, that’s just crazy…"

My limbs shake as I try desperately not to think of how hungry I am for even a moment of sunshine. The heavy, inky black clouds overhead threaten more snowfall. *They’ll be coming soon.*

I watch them from my spot, rooted in terror and anticipation. *Please don’t let it be me.* I can see the family gather around a large table. They gorge themselves on course after course of food. Meat is ripped from a golden brown carcass in the center of the table. Bottles are passed among the eldest. Each filling their glass with a red liquid moments before pouring it down their greedy throats. How many of my kind have they killed? Forcing us to eat and grow. Poking and prodding in turn, trying to find the healthiest among us. Every year, one or more are cut free and dragged away from here. From our home.

They’ve finished now. The men pull on boots and grab lanterns. I can see their young being fussed over by the females. Each of the small ones are wrapped in the down and hide from other creatures. *They are coming.* I watch as they race up towards where we stand. The children run screaming in insidious glee at a chance to choose one of us to sacrifice. A young man stops in front of me, contemplating my body, lifting a limb or two. *Oh, please don’t let it be me.*

I struggle for breath, but the sun is gone. All I feel is the cold, frozen snow around my feet. There is a joyous squeal from behind me followed by a sickening thud. The young man moves away to watch as another one of us is pulled from the earth.  The body is dragged back to the house, branches pulling at the snow-covered ground. Soon they will shove my brother into a corner, covering him in hot twinkling lights and heavy baubles. In a month from now, when they have gathered again for their yearly ritual, they will sit around him exchanging gifts. Not long after that day, he will be dragged back out and thrown into a grinding metal box. Shredded pieces will be all that is left of him. I shudder again, and it has nothing to do with the cold."

I was enthralled with the concept of veganism. She lost no time in coming over for lunch. We had healthy salad, tortillas with beans and rice with vegetable gravy that day. She opened up a new world to us - we learnt that vegans are usually healthier and likely to live longer. Maybe it's time my family starts eating healthy too.

That's when I decided that we'll have a vegan Thanksgiving. My husband yelled and claimed that plants are living beings too and that we would be murdering them. My kids bawled. Sure, it took some time to convince them. But they came around eventually.

Every year growing up, I’d joyfully help my mother prepare a table overflowing with homecooked Thanksgiving dishes. Then, just as I reached adulthood, my parents and siblings were killed in a car wreck. I didn’t do much cooking after that.

With no extended family or friends to turn to, I went from pulling turkey wishbones with my brother to pulling frozen trays from cardboard packages each November.

Despondent, I didn’t give much thought to the holiday-themed TV dinner I tossed in my supermarket basket this year, beyond the fact that it was half-off and not buried in ice.

“Chef Mayflower’s Thanksgiving TV Dinner Special” read the box in old-timey font, alongside a grinning cartoon pilgrim.

“A scrumptious, time-saving serving of all your beloved Thanksgiving staples. Contains something *extra* special for those in need of a nation’s-worth of love. Serves 1—and *only* 1.”

That night I ate my strangely-captioned dinner in front of a humming television screen, imagining that the characters from my favourite soap opera were dining with me. Though bland, the food wasn’t terrible. On that tray in my lap were all the components of a decent meal.

Just behind a film of plastic.

A few weeks later, I wound up in the emergency room. I had developed painful blisters across my entire body and was gripped by a skyrocketing fever. Although I couldn’t see the doctors’ facial expressions through their hazmat gear, I could tell from their hushed chatter that they were dumbfounded.

The news headline on the hospital room TV screen cleared up my confusion before they did.

“Mr Dylan Sanders of Massachusetts: the first recorded case of smallpox in half-a-century.”

From then on, there was always a reporter or scientist by my bedside. Schoolchildren from around the country sent get-well-soon cards and the Pope lead a prayer in my name. The Dream Foundation even helped me meet the cast of my favourite soap. To top it off, the supermarket chain paid through their nose to keep me from suing over the mysterious, tainted package.

But, in truth, I would never dream of suing. For the first time in years, I feel loved again.

Lying in this heavily-quarantined hospital bed, in front of me is all the compassion I’ve ever wanted to receive.

She genuinely couldn't comprehend why the  chicken crossed the road, or how curiosity could kill a cat. Sophie wandered through the world wide-eyed, in a non-stop state of confusion.


Trouble was, my whole family were farmers, and farmers sure love their quaint old sayings. Sophie would sit on the farmhouse floor in her short-pants with her books of number-puzzles (“that girl gonna fly a spaceship for NASA one day”, my mom would often say), and squirm with distress while my dad and his brothers spoke of “stitches in time” and “birds in the hand” and suchlike.


“You can't bottle lightning”, laughed my uncle Toby one stormy Christmas afternoon, and poor, curious Sophie took this as a challenge. She collected some old glass bottles and disappeared out into the woods, and that was the last time I saw her alive.


I kept the small, scorched whisky-bottle which they found in her hand. The weird thing is, it glowed with a small spark, and my hair stood-on-end whenever I touched it. I often wondered how on earth Sophie got the cork back inside the bottleneck, with her fingers little more than ash.


I placed that bottle above the fireplace, though my folks said it was morbid not to throw it out with the garbage. They weren't very sentimental, I guess. Weird thing was, I started to notice that the bottle would glow brighter, with a sort of electrical “hum”, every time someone said some old-timey gibberish, as if Sophie was still listening in, lost and confused as usual.


The next Christmas, uncle Toby came over like always, and soon my dad and him were as “drunk as skunks”. They were firing homespun homilies back-and-forth like they were competing for a prize, and Sophie's bottle was fizzing and hissing like “a cat on a hot tin roof”, as uncle Toby put it. He grew angry when I told him of the bottle's origin, perhaps tormented by the part he'd played in her passing. “If you ask me,” uncle Toby slurred, standing unsteadily to his feet,” that neice of mine must've been born with rocks in her head.”


That was when all the lights blew out. “That damn summabitch generator ain't work pop-s**t to a porcupine”, spat my mom, and those were the last words she ever spoke in this world. Sophie's bottle was buzzing and pulsing like some diabolical atom-bomb, and burning bright enough to show the beer-stains on uncle Toby's overalls. I ran straight out of that farmhouse when I heard the glass start to crack.


The police wrote the whole thing off as some sort of “bizarre farming accident”; I guess they didn't know what on earth to make of it. I heard talk of “ball-lightning” or even a unique triple-case of “spontaneous human combustion”. All I know is that I always loved thunderstorms afterwards, and I ALWAYS talk straight, as true as a lightning strike. For Sophie.

With that, you limp to your room, favoring your right foot as always. You get the shakes walking through the doorway, plunging into the darkness- cold sweat and fear come hand in hand. But you push on to the dresser to get your PJs on regardless. 

You set the alarm on your phone and put it on the charger, setting the case down on the stand by your head. You take care to avoid the section of wood that's been chopped up and scarred- the kind of mistake you only make once. As you shake your shoes off, you see your injured, bare foot again. By now, the three little missing toes on the right are calloused over, but the horror and blood of that night last year are still fresh in your mind. The shakes come back- *don't let the bedbugs bite*...

You curl up under the covers and get ready. You tuck the blankets around your feet, pinning them down tight with your heels. You roll the edges under your butt and sides like a burrito. Finally, you pull the covers over your head between you and the pillow. Within seconds, you're snug and warm and *safe*- magical thinking, but it works. The bedbug truly can't get at you under the blanket.

Having secured yourself for the night, you try to sleep. It doesn't work; it never works. But you try.

A small eternity later (ten minutes? An hour?), your bedroom door clicks open. Footsteps approach your bed, calm and smooth and deliberate. You clench your eyes shut and make sure there's no gap between the blanket and you.

""Baby? I came to check on you.""

A small hand reaches out and touches your feet, testing the blanket. The hand slides around both sides, finding no fault or opening. The shakes come back

""Good. I'm so glad, baby. Good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bedbugs bite.""

The clang of the heavy meat cleaver slamming into the wood next to your phone freezes you, paralyzes you- when you wake up it'll be the first thing you see, inescapable. It seems like you both cannot breathe at all, and are hyperventilating at the same time.

You double check that the covers are wrapped around you- you know she sometimes comes back- and you try to relax enough to finally fall asleep."

Left me here alone.

The fires had been burning brightly, an acrid smell still hung in the air. The feast had continued long into the night. They had taken a lot of joy in what they had done, what they were doing.

So much merriment for something so tragic.

We had arrived seven weeks previous. The journey had been arduous but not long after landing we had a crude campsite up and running and were starting to get a lay of the new land around us.

It did not take long for them to show themselves.

As our camp was starting to grow,our survival skills sharpening, they started appearing, silently, in the treelines. Watching us, judging us. They never made contact. We approached them once, they disappeared back into the undergrowth like wraiths of the forest.

All seems so obvious now. Now that it is too late.

They struck the night afore last. Like ghosts in the night they were upon us. Still silent. Expertly moving from quarter to quarter, slitting the throats of the women and babes. Bludgeoning the menfolk.

Then we awoke.

Us men had been tied in the forest. A pile of corpses, still fresh, not a stones throw from us. Our crude shacks we had come to call home burned in the night. They had taken what we had toiled so hard for and were feasting on it right before us.

Then the true terror began.

They took us one by one. Over to the fires, to be strung and burned alive. The screams of our comrades was hard to bear, hard to hear over the gutteral cries of our captors own tribal tongue.

Screams of victory. Cries of torment.

Now I am alone. A last victim left to suffer my fate.

Mommy and daddy and my brother and me, we all sit at the table and eat all day! The whole week before is so crazy though. We have so many guests  in the days before, so many people come and go. Mommy and daddy are very busy so they take all week off of work for it. My brother and i we have special jobs, we have to look after all the guests.

The whole week before we must feed our guests and bring them lots to drink and make them happy cuz they all seem so sad. So my big brother and me take them all the food and drinks mommy makes for them to them and try to make them happy and hearty, at least that's what mommy says. Daddy he spends most his time going and picking up all of our guests and bringing them back and making sure they get good and settled in. We always have a lot of room in the basement sometimes they have to sleep in the attic also. 

Sometimes we get to talk to the guests but we aren't really supposed to. They say funny things though, they don't really make sense to me but mommy and daddy says grownups have a different way of talking, it's just funny to me though. My brother said one time last year he saw a few kids around his and my age in the attic but they were always sleeping. We feed them lots of food though and I'm always tired after eating a lot so I'm sure they were tired.

The night before Thanksgiving I can never hardly sleep with all the noise of mommy and daddy getting everything ready. Sometimes I get special Thanksgiving sleeping medicine though that helps. Usually my big brother gets it too but this year is special for him, mommy and daddy say he is old enough to help them get Thanksgiving ready with them now and he has to learn our tradition and how to help.

Last year I got the special sleepy medicine and I slept most of the night. Every now and then I will wake up and hear some of the noises. Our guests always leave the night before so they make lots of noises, sometimes they scream but mommy has told me they are just excited about Thanksgiving. When I wake up they are always gone and the food is always cooking and smelling so good, Thanksgiving always has a special smell. When everything is done mommy and daddy set the table and we say grace and then we start to dig in. The only thing is here at school and everywhere they call what we eat turkey but mommy and daddy always told me what we eat is actually called long pork but that was a secret family name for it. Anyways that's my Thanksgiving traditions with my family and I can't wait for it this year.

She'd never seen anything hiding under there other than a few discarded, now-too-small pairs of shoes, but she was convinced that when the sun went down, and the moon rose in the night sky, that something evil resided beneath her.

&#x200B;

Her mother had scolded her numerous times over her ""overactive imagination"", her father mocked her fear, sometimes playing off of it and telling her scary stories of monsters and ghouls. She would wrap herself in her overstuffed duvet, pulled over her head with only a gap in front of her mouth that allowed her to breathe. Lying there, in the darkness and gloom of her bedroom, she would imagine all manner of creatures pulling themselves out from beneath her bed frame. Witches, Goblins, Werewolves… things that go bump in the night. The only thing Ashley hadn't imagined, was the heinous, deformed creature that emerged on the night of her sixteenth birthday.

&#x200B;

After years of fearing what lurked beneath her bed, a sense of terror and validation swept over her when it finally revealed itself. Her best friend Anna slept snuggly in her sleeping bag on the floor, oblivious to the monstrosity crawling into Ashley's line of sight. Ashley froze, she couldn't have moved if she tried, her fight or flight failed her as her body became rigid and her breathing became ragged.

&#x200B;

Its skin was a pallid grey colour, its eyes a jaundiced yellow. Fingers that were almost as long as her forearm hung at its sides, its emaciated frame showing off a bone structure that was unnatural. It seemed to take in it's surroundings, sniffing briefly at Anna as she snored contentedly. It wasn't until Ashley let out a small whimper that it spun to face her, its jaw hanging loose exposing a black gaping maw lined with razor sharp teeth. Its eyes narrowed at her as she attempted to back away, the cold touch of the wall at her back. She wished she could sink into it, hide from its gaze.

&#x200B;

She felt helpless, if she called for her parents, she could startle it into action or worse… anger it. Instead she began to cry, feeling like a vulnerable child again, only hours after blowing out sixteen candles. The creature began to advance on her, its teeth bared, saliva dripping onto her blankets. It was only when Anna began to stir that the creature broke eye contact. Before Ashley could warn her friend of ten years, the creature was upon her. Within seconds, it had returned to the darkness beneath her bed, dragging Anna with it. All that remained was a tattered sleeping bag speckled with blood, and a bloodcurdling scream from Ashley's lips."
9xf0xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9xf0xn/the_statue/,The statue,412,22,1542314260.0,"There is a statue in the town where I grew up in. It has been standing in the middle of the market square for over a century, showing a vampire with a stake in his heart. A bronze sign at its feet recognises, what my family did for this town.

I come from a long line of vampire hunters. A family tradition that began when my ancestor on the way back from the crusades had to take a detour over the Carpathians and met a real vampire for the first time there.

The knowledge about vampires has been handed down from parents to their children for generations by my family. You think it's difficult to kill a vampire? Let me assure you, it is almost impossible. Silver, garlic, crosses? Completely ineffective. Stake in the heart? That does not kill a vampire. It just paralyzes him. It locks him in his motionless body. But once the stake is removed, the vampire is alive again and really angry. An experience that many would-be vampire hunters have paid for with their lives. If you really want to kill a vampire, behead him and burn him to ashes.

My dad taught me that. Like everything I know about vampires.

I remember exactly when we were hunting together for the last time. It was just before my wedding. We had tracked down a vampire nest. We sneaked into the catacombs, beheaded every vampire we could find, and burned down the whole place. An almost complete vampire tribe extinguished in one day. We had hoped to find the matriarch of this nest to finally eradicate this family tree to the roots. But she was not in the nest. No trace of her.

A little later we celebrated my wedding. Only the family. Within a small circle of people. We raised our glasses and my dad spoke a toast that our family would send the blood-drinking demons back to hell from where they came from as long as one of us walkes the earth. I sipped my glass and saw the charming smile of my wife.

Then all went black.

My family was slaughtered by the matriarch, whom we had not caught. While we were all knocked out by the drug in the wine, she had cut the throats of my parents, siblings, uncles and aunts. But for me she had other plans. She had given me some of her own blood, making me one of her own. I noticed how her blood had changed me, but that did not help. She was sitting on my chest. A stake deep in my heart.

Exterminating the root of evil, she told me as she licked her fangs, was her plan too. Her approach was just another.

She pulled off the ring, which I had put there only hours ago.

And so she cursed me for my crimes against her tribe to eternal life. Paralyzed, but with full consciousness. Covered with bronze. In the middle of the market place."

On the 8th of June 2018 the poison gas swept across the island of Guam. Radio transitions from the outside world soon told us that we had been quarantined. Half of the population had become infected they told us. 

Zombies.

It’s the only word that fits what they are. Sharp teeth, discoloured skin, damn near impossible to kill and the smell, oh god the smell.

We hide from the zombies, that’s all we can do. ‘Help will come, help has to come’

They are smarter than the ones in the movies. They seem to be able to organize themselves, even use tools. 

It’s like they are hunting us as prey. 

Sometimes they even say disconnected words.

But they still want our brains, always muttering about our brains ‘what fuckin a cliché’ I think to myself.

\---

August 15th is the day it happened for me. I had been alone for a while. The others and I had…. disagreed. I found myself locked in a gas station, the perfect setup. Food, water and structural preparation for being attacked. 

4.02pm the electricity went down. 

4.18pm I can see them! Their eyes have gone yellow. 

4.32pm Oh god this place has a basement, where is the entrance!?

4.57pm My last stand, in the toilet of all places! They will get through the door anytim…. ahhh fuck, four of them.

I fight….

\---

I wake up in what looks like an attacked medical tent, restrained. 

It takes a few minutes for me to get my bearings, it’s so bright. 

Then Major Gemma Shepard comes to explain that I have spent the last few months as one of the infected. 

The gas was apparently meant to be a human enhancement serum, but the first attempt caused hallucinations, paranoia and delusions. The staff overseeing the project were affected and became erratic. They eventually lost their minds, thus allowing the serum to escape the lab and affect the whole island.  

I had been given the treatment for the infection, plus version two of the serum. 

“It’s only us here, we’re quarantined until we have control over the infection. There are better people for this job out there, but the people on this island are all we have” she explains at a blurry distance from me.

“The human brain can only last so long under those conditions” she adds.

I get to keep the higher pain threshold and stronger muscles. 

But we need to go save the other poor souls and minds still affected.

“Will you help us” I hear in a disjointed wheezy voice.

I nod, and my restraints are loosened. 

“Welcome onboard” she says with an eerily wide smile, showing her sharp and jagged teeth. 

“Let’s go save some brains” "

Ladies plying her trade never used their real names. A wholesome girl-next-door with a kinky streak was how her profile described her. A gallery of subtly airbrushed pictures of the fresh-faced twenty year old university girl at the top of the page contrasted amusingly with a set of more lascivious photographs accompanied by a laundry-list of perversities she was prepared to endure located near the bottom of her portfolio just above her contact details.

Just the sort of girl to bring home for Thanksgiving.

She was initially hesitant to take up my offer to be my companion for Thanksgiving dinner, but - predictably - avarice prevailed. The amount of money stuffed into the envelope I handed her could've covered her tuition for an entire semester, never mind her living expenses.

But what is money compared to the joy and satisfaction of seeing your collected family doting and fawning over the golden-haired All-American sweetheart that now graced the table? For each story (fanciful or not) she told of her carefree upbringing or her scholastic and athletic successes, my family seemed to have a dozen questions lined up. Instead of sullenly shovelling the contents of our plates into our mouths like previous Thanksgivings, the house now roared with conversation and merriment.

For once there would be no reproachful glares and titters to dog me for the rest of the year. No more grumbles from father about how she wasn't good enough for this family, or some meandering lecture from mother about how I could do so much better. No more piteous attempts at consolation by my aunt with that tired old adage about there being ""always more fish in the ocean"". Even my gang of younger cousins who'd usually call a temporary truce to their incessant bickering in order to make better sport of me over the Thanksgiving period now held me in awe and sought my approval at every turn.

Summer wasn't her real name and neither was the persona she cloaked heserlf in, but my family did not know that. I'd long suspected the blood of the coven, along with its arcane powers linking flesh and memory, had run thin within our line. Every time one of my parents or relatives took a moment in between greasy mouthfuls to look up at me and remark how ""wholesome and sweet"" this one tasted only added credence to my theory.

Like the others I'd brought home for Thanksgiving, they're all the same once you crack open the sternum, slit open the belly and disgorge its contents onto the dinner table like we had done with Summer. Yet I couldn't help but think to myself that perhaps joy and happiness - even if built upon a foundation of lies and murder - were still virtuous emotions, and thus worthy of thanks?

Who knows. Pass the gravy."

That's what normally happen, but recently it's different. Recently the figure is closer and after I see it with corner of my eye I feel it's presence, even if it's not there when I look.

I wake up, heart racing, ears pounding with hot blood that rushes in angry deluge. The insipid fear, those  bewildering mutters. I look around but I feel it inside me. A desire, perhaps. I cough, but bile rises up in my throat like a dreadful promise. I feel it clawing it's way through my chest, out the pores on my face. What are these convictions that grip me so?

I feel the life I had slip away as a new face rises to meet my own. I run fingers across my leathery skin and clawed appendages. My tail shivers with the anticipation of rebirth, poised for new transgression. 

Who allowed you to walk down this path? Was it the work of those who promised better? Was it the voices inside your head who promised better? 
Are you now better?
Your scales bristle in the dark, and you think of running to the mirror to stare at yourself through dark, foreign eyes.

Your eyes close slowly but you fight. You fight to understand who you are in this moment, but your heart tells you it is fading. Give up. Like a sinister shadow that touches and leaves, like ashes scattered in the tumultuous water in your gut- the beasts lie and wait.
Fading but not gone,
Accomplished but not done.

Again,
we shall be one."

The dream time skipped to when we get home, we all got out of the car. Everyone was paranoid for one reason. These creatures that we have noticed, lived in the ten acres around the house. They have grey brown greenish skin, the walk with a limp, is hunched over with its arm around its self and stands about 5 foot tall. When the run they straighten their spines and grow to about 8 feet tall, don’t have a limp anymore and can run very fast; they can become invisible and only can be seen when they want you to see them. When they are invisible they have an outline of them and inside of that The world that would be behind the creature is rippled. Whenever you come in contact with them you get affected some how. You can either get affected by having no emotion at all or have so many emotions it drives you mad. Then after a while you just go blank, like you have no soul and act strange. 

We all walked to the door, someone says “okay guys remember to stay inside.” We all nod our heads or mutter a yes in agreement. We go inside and I go to hang out with my best friend Yvonne. I go up to her room and we have a conversation about something , then she sets her phone down. I take her phone and start to look through it, she doesn’t like people on her phone, but she didn’t seem to care. I look at pictures of cats, some memes, and her boyfriend; I find a video and I press play. 

The video starts off with Yvonne and my our friend doing algebra homework, then a poster that is shaped like a hand moves behind them, likes it’s waving at the camera. They turn around and look at it, laugh and continue their work. The video stops and I scroll over and press play on the next video. The video is just of Yvonne staring out her window with a blank expression on her face and she is looking directly into the dark forest. I get a weird feeling and tell her that I am going to my room. 

When I walk downstairs I start talking to her sister, Anna. We talk about how we’re the only ones who haven’t been affected by what ever this is. I tell her about how Yvonne was acting strange, to be honest the rest of the conversation was a blur. That last thing I remember is going to my room and getting a really weird feeling. I glimpse out the window and just try to go to bed, but I did not feel okay about whatever happened before I fell asleep. After that I woke up, with an unsettling feeling."

In contemporary history, it has generally been agreed upon that we are not. How could we be? In the vast expanse of space, there was no way we could be the only ones. It eventually became accepted that we would probably never meet our inevitable cosmic brethren.

&#x200B;

Perhaps that was for the best, many thought. In our species' history, the strong has conquered the weak. Many figured this must be the case in the universal neighborhood, and we would do well to keep to ourselves anyway.

&#x200B;

First contact changed everything. We didn't know what they were--what they could be. We rallied the government to destroy them. Nothing was worth our demise.

&#x200B;

We had set our precedent. Every civilization our state annihilated, it did in simple self defense. We picked up from the ruins many things--technology, texts, architectural techniques we'd never dreamt of. We learned, we advanced. One thing never changed, though. Our belief in the value of life. The state kept destroying them to protect us.

Now we have in our crosshairs a pretty planet we expect will have life on it. There are reports they have harnessed nuclear fission to use in bombs. Apparently they've reached their own moon and even sent probes to a neighboring red planet. We call it ""The Blue Marble"", and as the debate on what to do with it hums on, we keep one thing in mind--we have to protect ourselves.

He feels sorrow, pain, and loss. He picks up a photo of a family, unseparated and untainted. He, unfeelingly, opens the door to his emotions for what may be the last time. “Well?” he thinks to himself “everyone in agreement?” There is no response. “Good, that’s what I thought.” He goes into the kitchen, reliving the destruction of his room, his photos, and his distractions from what is at hand, done by her and it. He relives the desecration of his most treasured person, his grandmother. The one he used to go to for anything and everything. He remembers why he hasn’t done this before, the manipulation of his emotions, so paperwork will not be done on her behalf. “Live for her!” As if. The life insurance taken out by her on “his behalf”. As a precaution; a meager reward for a life so young. He picks up the knife, bracing himself for what comes next. As he begins his work, she walks in. “What the fuck are you doing?! Not this again!” He has the knife taken away in an instant.

*I love my family.*

Dinner would start off well enough. Everyone would be seated and we would toast to the holiday. My cousins would sit for all of 5 minutes before screaming and flying from their seats to run around the table. They would grab their obnoxiously loud toys and smash against cabinets or our chairs. My aunt would watch and sigh “Boys will be boys.” *I love my family.* Soon after my uncle would loudly spout his political views. Drunkenly spewing hateful words about homosexuality and those liberal snowflakes, while my sister and her girlfriend sat across from him.*I love my family.* He, of course, would make sure to say no offense after every quip. Their eyes would narrow but neither my sister or her girlfriend would speak out against him. No, they instead would make passive aggressive comments about my aunt’s family. Most times, in their frustration, my sister and her girlfriend would turn on me. Asking invasive and pointed questions about my life and future. They would make me feel as if every decision i have made or will make is not up to their standard.  *I love my family.* My mother would spend the day preparing the house for guests and ""slaving away in the kitchen"" (her words). She would guilt anyone in the vicinity into trying to help, then martyr herself claiming she always had to do this alone. She would sit at the table and eye anyone who did not properly appreciate her work. Huffing and puffing if anyone dared to put salt on something or too much gravy on her over-cooked turkey. *I love my family.* My brother would sit heavily, pulling out his latest handheld game. He never cared that it was a time for family, a time to give thanks for all you had. With the volume turned up annoyingly loud, he used to grunt and shovel forkfuls of food into his pimpled face.

Lots of nooks and crannies in which to hang out. If I had to describe it in one word, I’d choose ""cosy"". That was until the new lodger moved in.

She’s awfully fastidious. Always tidying, constantly cleaning and dusting. Too clean if you ask me.

She’s got something against me, she seems to dislike me hanging out with her, she’s an aggressive drunk and she’s far too territorial. I suspect she desires the whole place to herself. 

The other night, she was watching tv alone, so I thought she might like some company. I’d literally just lowered myself onto the other end of the settee and with no warning, she took a swing. Repeatedly, bang, bang, bang, full on fisticuffs but luckily they were glancing blows only. I know how it might sound but honestly I hadn’t done anything untoward... well... to be fair, I may have startled her a tad but she lost it, transforming into a Jezebel, so I retreated! 

It’s not the first time I’ve had to deal with a territorial nincompoop, deep down most people don’t like sharing, but that’s human nature I suppose.

The next day she gravely escalated the situation. She’d left a snack for me, a peace offering I presumed, which I gladly accepted but after a few mouthfuls, the room began to spin. I crawled across the floor, trying my best not to vomit my guts up, when she jumps out, in one hand a spray-can and in the other a baseball bat, shouting ""Die you fucker""... charming!

In her stupor she sprayed herself then blindly swung her bat, missing me by a hair’s breath and dented the parquet flooring. In the commotion I escaped upstairs and hid in the attic.

I’ve been here for a hours now, peeping down on her through the rafters. I need to make my move soon, I’ll either dehydrate or starve. That is unless she finds me. It’s a fight to the death. I just need her to sleep. She’ll share the same fate as the others.

Later that night, her eyelids eventually grow heavy. Her fingers loosen around the baseball bat in one hand and the spray in the other. I carefully lower myself down from the rafters, dropping onto her pillow. I sink my fangs into her neck. 

The following day, she wakes, she feels the large and tender bite mark. She crawls across the floor, towards her phone. Her head rests on the parquet, her body stiffens, my venom’s taken hold. She spots me meandering towards her, I climb onto her face, crawl across her soft cheeks and look her directly in the eye. She blinks in horror. I tap, ""this is my home"" on her eye lashes. Her eyes glaze over.

After several days, attracted by her rotting corpse, my prey arrive. With my webs in place I fill my belly and enjoy my snug home all to myself. "

The jagged spires and monolithic beams that once connected this water locked hell to the rest of the sprawling city, pierce the waves. Once a statue and testament of what humans could accomplish. Now a warped, rusted, and wilted atrocity marking the “De-containment Zone”.

A long drag burns the tip of the cigarette, it’s red cap signaling a touch of life on this island.

“They’re always getting close.” A sigh as deep as the river itself. Frustration and helplessness merge, showcasing our constant desperation. 

“That doesn’t mean we can’t make it.” My wife flashes her honeyed eyes. My only beam of hope in this place. 

Another drag. 

“You know, those will kill you someday.” Julie laughs, pointing at the commercialized cancer stuck to my lips. 

“So will they.” With a flick, I cast the cigarette over the edge of the decaying building. The cigarette bounces off the head of one of the beasts. The moaning horde beneath us, churning and rumbling with hunger. Their decaying flesh only seeking the vibrant red meat that hides among the towers.

Like us. However many are left that is. Like our corpses that walk the city streets, we were left for dead to save money. They deemed it a waste of a chopper  if one was lost picking up survivors. Boats can’t make it. Too many of the dead reach from the depths of that river. And have capsized smaller boats meant to carry us to the beach. 

To survive something is to reach another side. To make it through. This is just, herding. They push us to one side of an island, taking some of us with them to join their shambling ranks. Rinse and repeat. So here we are. Food sources depleting, our numbers shrinking, and theirs growing. No way out, only one way to escape. Peering over the edge of the building, I see it. Our escape. 

I turn and put the cold steel barrel to the back of my wife’s head. The slug taking her away from this, inevitable doom. Her body falls to the concrete as I dive over the edge.

I imagine the gunshot caught their attention. They all gather and clamber over each other for me. Broken hands reach up to catch me. Mouths agape, awaiting their meal. It won’t be long.

This is the only way.

God forgive me."

The US Navy was closest when they flooded every frequency with distress calls, and thus did the US make first contact with a genuine Alien race.

They were quickly dubbed ""Arachnids"", even though they didn't really look like spiders. They merely had five legs arrange evenly, able to rapidly scurry in any direction with no loss of momentum- four strong arms on each side of the central torso let them respond in multiple directions. Their head was a mass of pulpy sensors and antennae.

The Arachnids were refugees, fleeing some great Tyrant from a far flung section of our galaxy. Their crash landing had shattered them physically.

Our doctors and zoologists and chemists and mathematicians had to work overtime to suss out... everything. How their joints were set up, what nutrition they needed, how their organs functioned. We put the survivors together again.

They graced us with knowledge by way of thanks- or tried to, anyway. We already knew most of their tips and tricks of physics and engineering and agriculture. But their pitiful, desperate gratitude touched the world nonetheless.

The surviving Arachnids set up a small colony in New England, all thirty of them.

---

They were diseased, these Aliens, these spiders. Microbes native to their planet found themselves in a biosphere three times hotter than home, with more varied biomass to play with.

The Plague struck at hospitals first- the medical staffs who treated the Arachnids were the vector of disease. The horror spread from them to the patients, from the patients to society.

The only places that could work to develop a counter to the Plague were the initial hot zones. Humanity never had a chance.

The Plague killed in a unpredictable way for every victim. Some developed fevers that spiked to 110 degrees and fried their brains. Other bled out from every hole they had.

Other mutated, growing extra limbs and tentacles, and long silky hair that dangled out out of their gaping open mouths. Some of the mutants developed necrophilia and cannibalism as side effects.

The world shattered under the strain. Quarantine was the only solution. And the quarantines developed into paranoia and war.

---

The equilibrium set in. 90% of the world had died in 30 years. The survivors were hard, and cruel; they had stared down starvation, enemy tribes, and savage monsters with equal ferocity. The humans who tried to take vengeance on the spiders found the Aliens had bigger guns and triple our birthrate.

That's when the Fleet finally arrived, fresh from the space ports of the Tyrant. 587 colony ships, each with 1,000 Arachnids aboard, all clamoring for fresh territory.

The Fleet detonated fifty strategically placed EMPs across our skies. All technology more complicated than an AK-47 turned into paperweights.

If ownership of the planet is their fate, than extinction is ours. If there's no explanation for them, then there is none for us..."

I'm starting to sweat slowly because I know I'm going to have to last another night, hidden so I can't be seen. 

It is a difficult but mandatory effort. 

I start to smell their smells, stronger and stronger, with each step that comes closer. 

The stairs creak, it is first the ""little ones"" who climb with a fast and noisy step, then the ""adults"", the tallest, who have a strong and heavy movement. 

I have to find the best hiding place and especially the most discreet possible, especially the most discreet, so that they don't find me, I hear the sound coming out of their mouths, it's close, but I don't understand anything they say, I can see their shadows shaking when they arrive in the corridor, they gesticulate indistinctly, growing and shrinking, so that it's difficult for me to know exactly where they are located. 

I know they're coming in soon. 

I'm scared, I feel my heart beating, I'm pounding in this narrow closet and trying not to make any noise until morning. I have to be careful, I don't know what could happen to me if they found me. 

Last time, my claws were sticking out under the bed, they found me and I now know what I can do to them."

Then the dream cut.

I was still standing in the bedroom but I was alone this time.

I felt myself call out a girls name, but heard her friend's voice.  I felt myself call her name again. My mouth wasn't moving. I heard her coming up then stairs, then down the hallway towards the bedroom and I stepped out of the doorway. She stopped and looked up, startled.

I quickly grabbed her forearm and her face dropped blank.

I let go.

She walked past me into the bedroom. Then over to the dresser. She opened the wide middle drawer.  I watched as she stepped one leg into the drawer and lowered herself down, her joints crunching and cracking as she crunched herself flat.

Do you smell that?

Once again, it's time for the annual Thanksgiving competition!

For a single day with family and friends, thousands will brave the perils of airport security and bumper-to-bumper traffic. To think, you've spent the whole year avoiding these people in the first place!

Once more, Macy's will fill up hot air balloons in the shape of beloved characters and parade them down the streets of New York and millions will watch this on television as if it is *actually* interesting. What the fuck? It's so boring!

And who could forget the greatest Thanksgiving tradition? Awkwardly sitting around the dinner table trying to get super drunk and avoid the topics of politics, religion, and social issues. Of course, your drunk ass uncle make his position on these three subjects known right away. But bless his soul, it's the only time of the year you see him and he'll be passed out in front of the television in a few minutes anyway. Did you happen to catch last years football game? I couldn't believe it when then twelve armed tentacle monster ate Tom Brady and pooped out a clone just as a good as the original!

And then, of course, let's not forget the greatest shopping holiday of the year! Black Friday! Don't like your family? Fuck'em! Camp outside Best Buy for three days in sub-zero temperatures. Bathrooms? Who needs bathrooms when you can get a specially designed lower quality television for sale? Mobs, riots, battles to the death in the aisles of Walmart for the hottest toys on the market! I heard those Good Guy dolls were making a comeback. 

Let's indulge ourselves in a feast of bite-sized Thanksgiving themed horror stories revolving around the tastiest genocide! 
___________

##**RULES AND REGS**##


* Stories must be Thanksgiving themed. If you don't know what I'm talking about, search [Thanksgiving 2017] or [Thanksgiving 2016]

* Contest entries **must** be tagged with [Thanksgiving 2018]. No tag. No qualify. Please ensure your tags are as seen, with capitalization of the ""T"" in Thanksgiving, and the full tag. No abbreviations. Yes, this seems rather anal and restrictive, but aside from my typical madness, there is a reason for this. Reddit's search feature is rather ""specific"" on search results. For example, during our /r/SleepSpell competition, the winning story wasn't available in the search results because it wasn't tagged exactly as the search I listed. So please, please, please, use the tag exactly as it is listed. For example, if my story is called ""The Undead Turkey Ate My Family"", it should say ""The Undead Turkey Ate My Family [Thanksgiving 2018]""

* All entries must adhere to the subreddit rules. Entries not meeting the guidelines will be disqualified and removed. There is no re-submission on these.

* Multiple entries are allowed. Just remember the 24 Hour Rule applies.

* Previous contest winners and author of the month winners are allowed to participate and may select which flair to continue with should they win the contest. Or we can work it out. I'm open to suggestions! 

* Top 5 Upvoted Stories are the winners. If there are any ties or if Reddit's vote fudging makes determining a placement too difficult, authors will split the placement and the next highest upvoted story will take the next placement until we have a winner's circle.

* If a single author claims multiple Top 5 placements, the next highest upvoted story will be added into the winners circle among authors. We don't want to punish good writers for placing multiple times but we also don't want to have an entire winners circle made up of the same person or people. Some contests in the past have had up to 7+ authors included in the winners circle due ties and multiple placements.  

___


**Top Winner Prizes:**

* $5 Amazon Digital Gift Card (Donated by yours truly and Commander-in-Creep, /u/Human_Gravy)

9wvbxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9wvbxa/where_the_dragons_went/,Where the Dragons Went,69,10,1542158662.0,"Dragons never die.

Great awe inspiring beasts that cruise through the air on leathery wings, belching forth fire can be slain of course.

Virtuous knights can ride out to meet them in battle, sword and shield in hand. Mighty viking warriors can wrestle with them in a final, heroic act to meet their death with honour. 

Even humble townsfolk can slay them with an arrow in a bare patch of their armoured hide, revealed by the beast in a moment of arrogance. 

The form can be defeated, but dragons always live on. The raw, base power, the lust and greed and seductive arrogance survives as long as humanity - a projection of our darkness manifested in the world.

One finds itself reborn in a dark alley in a gloomy, smog ridden city.

It stretches its arms, feels the cobbles against its booted feet.

The form has changed. Gone are the wings and scales, replaced by a cloak and smooth, pale, inhuman skin. The talons remain, after a fashion: digits that end in silvery claws that glint in the gaslights that line the street.

The eyes burn like hellfire and the limbs tremble with untapped power, muscles and sinews strong enough to leap over the roofs of the teeming city which is its new home.

The beast can still feel flames smouldering within, ready to bloom blue-white from its thin lipped maw.

Most curious of all, atop a head once crowned with scales there now sits a battered top hat. The dragon smiles and muses on the mind of humanity.

There will always be dragons. Even when the map is cleared of the fog of the unknown, when there is no blank spot left for 'there they be', they will remain. They will be summoned back to the dark corners of cities, called into existence by the fear that every child is born with; the horror at what lurks within themselves.

The people of this city have had their myths stolen away. Science and industry have robbed them of their stories, turned them into fables. 

While the Dark Continent on the fringes of the empire or the depths of the ocean might hold unknown terrors, there is no endless sky or untamed wilderness left for the great, wingéd beasts trailing destruction in their wake. 

So the dragon finds itself in a new form, one which the human mind can conjure in the face of such relentless civilization.

At the end of the alley, the dragon sees a shy faced girl, clad in servant's garb hurrying by. He sees her with more than mere eyes however, knows in an instant what lurks deep within her brow beaten heart, the lusts and desires and terrors scurried away in the depths of her mind. The feared and hidden secrets that have given him his new form. 

The dragon licks his lips, a forked tongue sliding across pointed fangs. This new world may be strange, but he knows his place in it, the part he is to play. With a new sense of purpose, he strides forward, flexing his talon tipped fingers.

It's time to go to work. "

I made a new friend a month or two ago, his name is mikey and he says Monday will be awesome. I dont have anything to look forward to very often, I've never had many friends so my life is usually pretty boring for me.

7th grade sucks by the way in case you don't know that, and without friends it sucks even more. Mikey though has made everything better. People dont seem to like mikey very much but I do, so atleast we have eachother. I went to mikey's house a couple weeks ago also and wow there is basically no parents to tell us what to do i couldn't believe it. I guess his dad left a few months back and his mom is gone like al the time.

I shouldn't say this but mikey has guns, knives and all kinds of cool stuff we played with everything at his house. It felt like we were really doing something. At school we are the bottom but with mikey at his house we were kings. Mikey says Monday though we will be kings of the school, I dont see how though unless we have guns on us then lol, jk.

I talked to him on the phone last night to get ready he said to wear black and maybe some camo things. I'm not sure what he has planned for us but he said if I just do what he says we will finally be popular. He also told me to bring an extra backpack too I dont know why though.

I'm going to meet mikey before school in the parking lot Monday and mikey said we will start showing everyone who we really are first thing in the morning before the first bell he said. I'll do anything he asks I believe in my friend for sure. Probably gonna be some sort of massive prank.

I'm gonna stop here tomorrow morning is Monday and I cant wait to see what mikey has in store for everyone. Hopefully it's good enough to get us a few new friends, maybe people will stop picking on us mikey says they will, after we show them all how it feels to be us."

Old town nestled between the round top mountains of east Tennessee.  Light rain drizzle and fog, loose leaves scattered.  You realize how bad a night you chose to be walking home half drunk each time the cold wind cuts through your thick coat on to your neck.

As you walk along a trail cut by deer and lit only by moonlight you cant help but feel as if you aren't alone.  Walking a little faster you cant shake the feeling.  That's when you hear it.  The sound of snapping limbs brings you to a dead stop, immediately sober.

Now scanning the dark that surrounds you the silence returns.  You begin to think you are just scaring yourself and turn to start walking again.  Once again you here the sound of snapping twigs and turning foliage.  You look behind you to see nothing as you break out into a sprint.  Off the path into the dense forest.  Still sprinting, still looking behind you.  Nothing can be seen.

Almost out of breathe and devoid of which direction you are going.  You lose your footing and begin tumbling head over heels down an embankment.  You finally come to a stop against a large oak tree.  Busted what feels like every bone in your body.  You are sure your leg is broken now and you have no idea how far of the path you've gone.

That's when, through watery eyes, you can see it.  Its carved handily into the massive oak tree that stopped your fall.  The freshness of the carved letters to hard to comprehend.  You begin to cry as you read it aloud.   ""NOW LOOK BEHIND YOU"""
9wo6xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9wo6xw/nightmare_bed/,Nightmare Bed,0,0,1542107647.0,"As I laid in bed knees drawn up to myself I could feel the presence in the corner of the room. waiting. Watching for any sign that they could move in. The covers were drawn tight up over my head and the only light came from a moon that was hidden behind clouds.

As soon as the clouds covered the moon fully I felt them move closer to the bed and closer to me. although I couldn’t see them I still knew what they looked like, I could see them in my mind like a primal instinct of something to fear and something to avoid. The room was empty, just a large bed that offered no safety from the creatures and a door from their world into mine at the foot. The creatures themselves where pale imitations of us, pale skin and dark lanky hear hung in rats tails down their shoulders. Their teeth were filed into points and fingers long almost like the talons of certain birds of prey designed to grab slash and tear as they held you down.

The only solace was the sun somehow this had the power to save me and burn away any demons of the night. The sun is a primal force in the world, it has the power to burn away fears and heal the terrors of the night.

As the night wore on the creatures got braver and began to argue amongst themselves, the leader, a pale lanky creature with white rotten flesh, wanted to brave the brightening room to snatch me and bring me through the door to their realm of pain and terror but the other two held them back.

Although strong in their own world in ours they are weak and feed on fear, if we stay strong in our fears then they can gain no power over us. In the end, the leader won out and they began to creep forward on long spindly legs ready to snatch me from what was once the safest place. A place where as a child I could hide away and be protected from the world and all that it contained.

At this point, I was still under the covers silent barely breathing but I could still somehow see them creeping forward and surrounding me, I felt their weight on the bed as they edged towards me and began to peel back the only safety in the covers that I had.

Luckily as they got so close. Oh so close to snatching what could well have been my soul into a place that bears not thinking about the first rays of the sun finally burned away the terrors and the door into their realm and I was instead left with a normal bedroom with perhaps a few human shaped coats hung around the room."

She turned off every light in the house and slowly moved towards a wooden door. 
""Only 3 hours and 33 minutes and then it will be over."" , she said in a soft voice. 
She was ready to summon the 'Midnight Man'. She started knocking the door. 
What she didn't know was that she didn't summoned me, I was always there waiting for her to complete the ritual. She didn't know that the salt circle won't help her.

We got up early and had breakfast and said goodbye to daddy who was leaving on a trip for his work for the whole weekend, I'm going to miss him all weekend too. 

After daddy left and mommy and I got all dressed up, we were going to go see a movie. Mommy drove and even let me pick what music we listened to before we got to the movie. Then while we were watching the movie Uncle John came to see us there. He sat beside mommy and hugged her real tight even whispered in her ear. I don't know why, maybe because it was a kids movie for me but mommy did not seem to like the movie, she didn't laugh at all.

After the movie Uncle John said he was going to come with me and mommy because he didn't have a car. I thought that would be fun, cuz I'd never met Uncle John before, and I wanted to know him he seemed nice. We went shopping next and I didn't like the store at all there was no toys or anything, just camping stuff and tools and and shovels and rope, I didnt know what we were going to do until uncle John said me and mommy and him were going to go camping together, and that did sound fun, wish I'd known uncle John before now. I don't know what was wrong with mommy she was being very quiet the whole time.

We went back to our house before camping though, so I knew I was going to grab a few dolls and other things so I wouldn't get bored. I went straight to my room like mommy said to get ready, and I heard alot of noise downstairs but I figured mommy and uncle John were just playing, so I kept getting my bag ready. After a little while I went looking for mommy, but I found uncle John first, and he told me mommy wasn't feeling good right now and she wanted me to go have fun with uncle John anyway and to have fun.

I wanted to say bye to mommy but uncle John said she was already sleeping and said she didnt want to be woke up and I know how mommy is so that was ok. Now I'm in the front seat of mommy's car with Uncle John! I never get to ride up front, mommy never let's me so Uncle John is so fun. We have been driving for a very long time now, uncle John said we are almost there though I'm so excited, I wonder what kind of stuff we will do, the only part is I'm gonna miss mommy for the weekend but I'll only be gone for the night.

I have to go now diary, Uncle John said we are here at his cabin in the woods it looks amazing and I'm so excited to see the inside. I don't know what games we are going to play but Uncle John already said I could stay up as long as I wanted I never get to do that even on weekends. Can't wait to write all about the cabin and my fun with Uncle John tomorrow on the ride back home to mommy, and I sure hope shes feeling better, ok bye diary!"

""Oh.  Ma'am...""  Her voice grew gravely quiet—almost a whisper.  ""I need you to listen very carefully.""  

The back door, too, was locked.  Out the kitchen window, the backyard was a pure, cold, black.  The full moon kept its uncaring gaze cradled between the clouds.  

""The call came from inside the house.""  

I froze.  

""We need you to hide.""  

I walked slowly—quietly—back into the basement.  I descended slowly.  Each step creaked mercilessly.  Then I saw it.  A glowing light in the darkness of the basement.  A phone screen.  

""Ma'am?  Officers are on the way.  Please hide and stay safe.""  

Hide?  She's right there.  I covered the microphone.  

There on the floor was the glowing LED screen of a wireless phone.  Next to it was her.  Bloodied.  Beaten.  But apparently more than alive enough to call 911.  Cute.  

A whimper squealed out of her as I kicked the phone away.  I crouched down, right beside her, and pressed my hand against her mouth while I uncovered the microphone.  

""O-ok.  I'll hide in the basement.  Please hurry!""  

I hung up, tossing the phone aside.  

""You know...""  I said as I uncovered her mouth.  ""It takes about 20 minutes for cops to arrive after receiving a 911 call.""  

This time, wrapping my hands around her neck, I took my sweet time making sure she was dead.

""Hi""
""Hello""
""Hey""

Etc. All within the span of a few seconds. Sometimes he will even send little anecdotes. Stuff like what he was doing, a prank he pulled at school, little things like that; it was really not a problem at first. But then the messages got longer, more personal, and almost frantic at times. Being the asshole teenagers me and my friends were, we decided to troll the kid, and make fun of him. I mean who cares right? We don't even know this kid.


 about a month passes and we all forget the kid ever existed. He stopped messaging us, and we just sorta forgot; until we saw his account had been memorialized. According to a post on his page, he had been battling the late stages of cancer, and was losing. His last wish was to be remembered by people. So he added as many people as Facebook would allow, and messaged even more. He just wanted to be remembered, and not for how he died. Since that day, we have all been more careful of how we treat people. You never know why someone does the things they do. "

The dot grows until I can make out its hull. For a moment, I’m a handful of feet under the surface. I can feel the dull thudding of the propeller, pushing pitifully through the water.

I don’t know why they insist on coming here. Aren’t they happy with what they have? They don’t belong on the ocean. They’re not made for it. I am. They know as well as I do.

I screamed and screamed and kicked and punched and fought.

“we can’t go to Granma’s because of the Pracday accident”

We stayed home. My parents shouted at each other. Dad’s face never did get impaled.

We’d tried for years, my wife and I. After the old-fashioned way failed us, we attempted IVF and even looked into adoption. Nothing worked. We were well into our thirties when we found out that Charlotte was expecting at last.


“Abortion is a valid choice,” the doctor had felt the need to remind us. Judgment written all over his face. Pity too. But I could not bear the thought of not having this baby, and neither could she. 
We enrolled him in school when he was four. There were fifteen children in his class.  


By the time he was six, we took him out of school.  There were only five kids left in his class. The school had already shut down the lower grades. It wasn’t long before the entire school system would collapse, our son’s teacher confided in us. 


“Between you and me,” she said. “School isn’t really about learning anymore. Nobody cares about that, now.”


After we took him out of school, I quit my job. Charlotte had quit her job as a hairdresser years earlier, but I was a police officer. I felt like I had an obligation. My wife begged me to quit in the end. She could not handle being at home alone with our son. Besides, the city was not a great place for us to be anymore. 


“When is it happening?” my son asked us. We were in the living room, packing up some clothes and food for our upcoming trip. 


“You already know,” my wife said, impatiently. She was often short with him.


“January 18, 2032,” the boy said, in a sing-songy voice.


“That’s right,” said my wife. “Now go upstairs and play. Your dad and I are going to load up the car.”


“But how *long* is that from now?” our son hopped around impatiently, a lego rocket ship in his hands. 


“It’s three weeks from now,” I said. I walked over to our son and put my hand on his shoulder. 


I do not regret having him. We made the right choice. 


“Okay,” he said. “And then the sun will go BOOM, right?”


My wife stood up and covered both of her ears with her hands.


“I can’t fucking deal with this, YOU deal with it!” she yelled, before storming out of the room.


My son looked upset. 


“Yes,” I said to him. “The sun will go BOOM. But first we’ll go camping out on the beach, and we can build sand castles and collect shells.”


“Can we swim?” my son asked. “Because the water is warm now?”


“Yes,” I said. “We can swim. Go get your swimming trunks.” 


“Yay!” my son threw up his little arms, the lego rocket ship still in his left hand. “BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,” he sang, and he ran up the stairs.


I am glad that we had him. He can handle this, even though we can’t.

Eric’s mind was running rampant just looking at its shiny curved exterior

Whatever it was, it was no type of craft that he’d ever seen. He couldn’t even imagine that it was made by humans...our most advanced technology looked nothing like this. He took a peek inside.

Yep… yes, definitely alien… “Jesus Christ!”  He could tell at a glance.  No seats, no keyboards, no buttons, or screens.  No bathroom.  

Eric stepped inside for a second

He glanced over at his house, close to a mile away.  A faint desire flickered through his head, and in the next instant both he and the ship were sitting right next to his front steps.  

“Wait… What just happened?….Did the ship take me here? Did it just read my thoughts?”

He had to find out.  He located a large tree in the distance, purposefully expressed a desire to travel there, and \*\****was\*\**** there, instantly, with barely even a noticeable swoosh.

“Fantastic!”

Over the next few days Eric tested the ship; growing gradually more bold.  He flew up into the clouds and stratosphere.  He circled the moon,  and even went as far as Jupiter, traversing the great distance in under a minute.  He spent a long time just looking at the planet, basking in the majesty of it, the beauty of its swirling colors, its immensity, before turning his eye to that point of light that was home.

“Wait”, he thought. “I have the ability to travel to any point in the universe!  I  can do anything.  I could visit the Andromeda galaxy.  I could search for other intelligent life in the Milky Way and be the first human to communicate with them.” 

Thinking about all the possibilities, Eric decided what he wanted to do first.  He started in one direction, perpendicular to the galactic plane, and went straight, as far and as fast as he could.  Stars were whizzing by by the thousand, but even then the view was only gradually changing.   After some minutes, it started to come into view.   He was beginning to climb above the Milky Way itself; the central bulge rising up massively and spiral arms sprawling out in both directions to almost true infinity.  “Ahhh, yes, this is it!”, He cried out.  It was beautiful.  A chaotic cloud of gas frozen in time.  Profoundly complex, containing the limitless.  He knew that he was the first human to see this, and no emotion could convey the experience.  There were no words, only joy... and tears.

After some time, he made to head home.

But looking back, and beginning to travel back in the direction from which he’d come, he became concerned.  

“Return to Earth”, he thought, but the ship made no move.

“Take me back where I came from” he tried, but again, nothing.

His stomach dropped. His jaw dropped.  The bottom dropped out.  He understood.

He could venture to any point in the endless universe, but home was lost forever."

9w6lqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9w6lqj/adequate/,Adequate,276,7,1541964286.0,"Donna did her darnedest to be as good a daughter as she could. She studied hard, stayed away from temptation, and since her dad worked long hours down the coal-mine, she worked her fingers to the bone cleaning their house and preparing his supper. But no matter how much she endeavoured to make a good impression, all Donna ever did was merely “adequate” in her father's eyes.


Scoring highest in her class on every pop-quiz, that was “adequate.”


Winning a state-wide poetry contest aged just thirteen, her poem (about her dad) was “adequate.”


When she brokered a peace-treaty for the entire Middle-East, it was “adequate.” 


Her dad sat down every night, barely honoring Donna with a nod, and wolfed his cooked-to-perfection steak dinner, before grunting that one word through a mouthful of food.


And boy, did that word begin to grate.


In truth, she knew her father wasn't a bad man. He'd never been violent, or mean. And every Christmas and birthday, a big gift awaited her; more than he could really afford. Friends and neighbors spoke highly of the guy, despite his grindingly taciturn nature. But a rage grew inside Donna; bulged more murderous every time she heard that word.


“Adequate. Adequate. Adequate.” Had his own father been this way? Maybe. He'd died down in the mine before Donna was born. Her mom, who was kind and warm and perfect, passed away when Donna was still a little girl. A light was snuffed out like the Canary in a coalminer’s cage. At least, for Donna. Her father had always been the same way.


On the day Donna graduated high-school, the seat she'd saved for her father was the only one empty in the whole high-school gym. Donna wasn't surprised. And anyway, even if he'd been able to take the day off work, did she really wish to see him sat there, sullen and unimpressed?


But something inside Donna died that day. She didn't make any special effort with her father's steak that evening. Why bother? His meat was served tough and grey, and he struggled to chew his mouthfuls. Donna's eyes danced with delight as her dad started coughing; choking on his lack of gratitude. She hadn't intended to kill him that night, though she somehow couldn't find the resolve to aid him, as his eyes bulged and his weathered face turned blue. “What's the matter, daddy?” She laughed. “Is your steak not adequate?”


Now Donna thinks about her father a lot, after she died in a fast car she'd bought with her inheritance. There isn't much else to do but think. She stands alone in a small, not-quite-warm-enough, white windowless room. She is served just-enough water so she'll never dehydrate, and just-enough food so she'll never starve. Is this Heaven or Hell? She'd screamed this, over-and-over, for the first thousand years or so. All she'd ever been told was that she'd be there forever. Barely enough information. Like everything else in her eternity, all she is given is adequate."
9w5nu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9w5nu4/chocolate_cake/,Chocolate Cake,433,28,1541957675.0,"It's been years since I baked a cake, and I have to admit I was nervous about this one. Lists. Timings. Making sure everything went in in the right order. I got so tense doing it that I almost forgot the key ingredient, which would have been a disaster. Got there in the end, though; now it's ready. Rich brown chocolate. Thick icing. I'm half tempted to cut a slice myself.

\*

I baked the cake for Ben. He's the young man that lives across the road from me. Used to come and help me around the house after my Jim died. Bit overweight, but he's a sweet boy. I was daydreaming by my window the other afternoon when I saw him walking home in his school uniform. Head down, shoulders slumped. He was almost at his front door when this bigger boy came running up behind him. He swung his leg to kick the back of Ben's feet, and the poor lad almost went head over heels. I couldn't tell what they were saying to each other because my window was shut, but I could tell Ben was doing his best not to cry.

\*

Curtain twitcher. That's what my husband used to call me. ""You stand by that window any longer, Jean, and you'll wear a hole in the rug."" Cheeky bugger. We used to bake the cakes together, back in the day. I'd be elbow deep in mixture while he leaned on the kitchen counter, making his jokes.

\*

I want to help Ben. I figure I'll call to him when I see him walking past, invite him in. Show him the cake. It's special, I'll say, because it's the first one I baked since my Jim died. They warn them about strangers in school, I know that, but Ben won't be bothered by me. I'm old, for one thing, and he's known me for years.

\*

Jim and I used to do them together. Every one, every little step in the process. The planning. Sourcing the ingredients. Cleaning up after ourselves. These days it’s harder. The world has changed. If you leave so much as a single crumb it'll catch up with you. Now I have to do it all myself, too. When we were younger I just picked the guest and took care of refreshments. Jim was the one on clean-up.

\*

Cancer got him in the end. It was like poison. Started in his stomach, but by the end it'd spread through his whole body. Karma, I guess some would call it. What goes around comes around. I've heard some people lose their fear in God when their partner dies, but for me it was the opposite.

\*

Yes, I think I'll invite Ben in today. Cakes don't keep forever, and he'll want it while it's fresh. I can just picture it now. The knife going through the icing. His fingers digging into chocolate. The look on his face, that wide-eyed stare, as he takes the first bite."

He turned in place and his gaze snapped towards the skyscrapers, to the people around him, to the cars stuck in the morning rush. The pale skin on his face looked tight as if it was pulled over the bones and clasped on the back of his head. He kept rubbing his eyes.
 
The light turned green and the crowd pushed me onto the crossing. I lost the sight of the man. Mornings teemed with weirdos and I had forgotten about him before I reached the other side of the crossing.
 	
I was at lunch when I spotted him again. He walked into the restaurant and scanned the tables. I chuckled at the odds. His eyes were a bit more open and the confused look disappeared from his face. He seemed eager. 
 
Our gazes met and I thought I saw a smile tinkle on his tense skin. I couldn’t distinguish the face, but I had seen his light blue eyes before. The man disappeared while I tried to remember where.
 
I thought about him a few times that afternoon. I stalked a few people online but failed to find him. 

By the time I was done with work, I had forgotten about him again. I strolled past the stores on my way to the train and thought about the empty fridge at home. I remembered I was due for a free pizza and that made me smile and hasten my step.
 
 I froze when I saw him at the other end of the wagon. He smiled and stared at me. A ghastly sheen dimmed the blueness of his eyes. His skin loosened a bit. I was sure I knew him, but I still couldn’t place him. 
 
He smiled but it wasn’t funny anymore. I hoped the man would go his way if I ignored him. The train stopped and started, the passengers went out and in. The man sat motionless with his stare and smile fixated on me. 
 
I gazed out into the night, but I mostly saw the reflection of my own troubled face. I tried to calm down and gather the courage to confront him. I squeezed the overhead bar. The sweat formed a stream and trickled into my sleeve.
 
My phone startled me. My mother called. 
 
“What do you want?”
 
“I-I’m sorry to bother you but, but I thought you should know. He was your father after all… He died this morning.”

I looked at the stranger. From the evil smile and remorseless eyes burst out hundreds of memories, not one of them pleasant. I snapped my gaze away.

“And he loved you so much before he got sick. Please find strength to forgive him--”

She talked on, I didn’t hear her. I rushed out of the wagon. The train crawled past the lights outside. I glanced backwards. The stranger wasn't there anymore.

No barrier will hinder them. No weapon will stop them. They will find you, and ruin your family. They always take the favorites too. The first born son, the intelligent young boy, the new born child. Mercilessly, they drag their victim out of their bed and pull them through the house. They leave a mess, organs and blood, glass and splintered wood. The walls will be painted red after they are done. They make sure you know what they took from you. Yet you will never hear your loved ones scream. 

And tonight I run with them. My bare feet carrying me across the ground, my black cloak hiding my limber body. Ill take the person you love the most in this world and tear them apart. Many have seen my face, none have lived.

There was screaming outside and the lady and gypsy ran to the screams.  A man had a sack with him along with a knife.  ""Matthew is stealing our income help!"" two women each in the doorway of a tent screamed.  The gypsy grabbed the man, and wrestling him to the ground.  But the thief plunged his knife into the old gypsy's back, killing him.  He then got away.  Matthew rode a horse to a bar in a village.  A few minutes later, he drank a bottle of Jim Beam Whiskey at the counter.  As Matthew cringed feeling a shadowy-hand on his shoulder, he turned around.  

It was the gypsy's apparition, with his long hair, resembling a shadow.  His eyes and inside of his mouth shined-white, and the phantom cackled in his raspy-tone.  ""Matthew, I curse you for stealing money and you kill me too!"" the spirit of the gypsy moaned to him in his raspy-tone of voice.  The ghost brought its shadowy-ghostly-fingers from Matthew's shoulder to his neck, and a magical-glowing-light of white shined from his dead-fingers to Matthew's neck.  

Matthew cringed with fear, the white glow faded and the gypsy's ghost faded too.  Matthew chugged his bottle of Jim Beam down.  He began panting then.  He left the bar and rode the horse to a bridge over a stream.  There, he and the steed rested by the water.  Matthew awoke and it was night.  He screamed, discovering he was a skeleton in rags.  The rotten zombie of Matthew was decaying with worms writhing within his eye-sockets and around his skull in the light of the moon.  The shadowy-ghost of the gypsy was there just then.  He laughed in his raspy-cackle, as the skeleton screamed in its black rags and the worms along with maggots coated his bones.  The zombie grew silent and fell into the river.    "

&#x200B;

\-------------

&#x200B;

I awake... suffocating... crushed... my hands tied, I struggle to push the heavy unconscious bodies off me.

&#x200B;

Finally, I emerge, gulp a deep breath and check my surroundings.

&#x200B;

A Naked Babe skrieks uncontrollably, banging against an invisible barrier.

&#x200B;

As I tap and squint I see the barrier’s outline, surrounding us in all directions. In one corner, a Small Guy nibbles at a limbless body. He says he’s been trapped for days and recommends we eat. I’m not that desperate... not yet.

&#x200B;

An octopus-like Creature crashes in from above. The unconscious wake... and freak out. It grabs Small Guy but with our hands tied we can’t fight back... the ceiling closes above.

&#x200B;

Naked Babe asks me to protect her, she’s hot, who knows how long I’d be in here?

""I’m Shell""

""I’m Lucky"".

&#x200B;

Through the barrier, we observe the celephopod Creature carry Small Guy to the opposite side of the huge cavernous room. It places him carefully onto the smoothest surface I’ve ever seen. What I thought was the entire alien is just one appendage of a huge grotesque thing. The other appendage is tipped with a sword-like pincer, it pierces Small Guy’s head, slicing it in half.

&#x200B;

I remember something. When I was a kid, my mum told me and my siblings she’d been abducted by evil aliens but she’d escaped when the ship crashed, luckiest day of her life. That’s how I got my name. I’d thought she was full of it. Hopefully I’d inherited her luck!

&#x200B;

For the next few minutes Shell and I bite, scratch and rub through the ties around my hands. We’re nearly there with hers but the room brightens, the appendage bursts down and scoops up Shell. I fight back but it brushes me off and pulls Shell towards the bright light. The others do nothing, happy to be spared for a few moments longer. Cowards!

&#x200B;

The gap above remains open, I climb up, throw myself over but land painfully on the flat alien floor. But it’s too late... The silver claw briefly hovers over Shell... I gasp in horror at the thud and crack. Then the strange odorous alien atmosphere hits me.

&#x200B;

With my senses dulled gulping their putrid air ... I scurry towards the corner...

&#x200B;

...Their deep tones vibrate above me. Large yellowy teeth-packed mouths laugh at my desperate escape attempt. The Creature lifts me high, the corpses of strange beings litter the shiny surfaces and worst of all, Shell turns bright pink as they boil her lifeless body. I instinctively claw and scratch its soft appendage as hard as I can. It screams unintelligible gibberish:

*""Bloody hell Chef!""*

*""I told you to be careful!""*

*""He's got some grip! Clever little bastard nearly escaped. I feel tight killing this one.""*

*""Fuck that Steve, he's worth £25""*

*""Sorry little Lobster, it's not your lucky day"".*

For those of you who don’t know about Diwali, it is a Hindu festival of lights. A time for the family to decorate their homes with lamps and pray to the Goddess of Prosperity for a prosperous and happy life. Throw a feast for the less fortunate and distribute new clothes to them. And the day isn’t complete until the entire community came together to burst firecrackers. 

Oh, those times - there would be crackling sparklers, enchanting flowerpots spouting bright hues and colourful rockets that would adorn the skies and mesmerise the old and the young. Laughter used to fill the air. It used to be difficult to walk down this street! 

Mr. Mehta’s kids were the first to settle abroad. Eventually they stopped visiting him. The community tried to support him, but he lost interest in lighting up his home for Diwali and finally in his life. More children followed his children out of the country and slowly their parents followed him. Mrs. Sharma’s son looked down upon the poor. Unlike his generous mother, he felt that poverty was because of their laziness and they had none but themselves to blame. Donations were stopped after her demise. Sadly, he lost his only daughter in an accident on this very day. I can’t stop myself from shaking my head – no parent should outlive their child. 

Due to increased  environmental awareness, bursting of firecrackers have been banned this year. Counter arguments were given but not sustained. Children shrugged and returned to their tablets. Parents were happy to not spend a fortune on crackers this year. Hear that – that’s the melody of silence. Here, take a deep breath – you can even smell the grass! 

What the elders told you was that you should pray, donate and burst crackers on this day. What they didn’t tell you was today’s the only day I can travel up to Earth and these were the only remedies keeping me at bay. 

Happy Diwali finally!

My parents were at work while I was enjoying my weekend. (Our front door has two glass windows beside it) - I was watching The Kardashians, when I suddenly saw a small boy (5-7 year old) peeking through the glass. I opened the door and saw the kid with a Lady (35-40 year old). She tells me that her son is in a club, and is selling candies for a fundraiser. I saw no pamplets, as I was talking to the kid that lady kept looking at my living room. Her eyes were everywere. I told her that since my parents are not home, I cannot give money without their permission ( a very stupid mistake). She told me that she will be back around evening time, and wants to continue asking my neighbors. As they head out, I lock my door immediately. I see the lady looking at our backyard, and then driving away. She never stopped to ask any of our neighbors... "

Technological progress forged onwards on all fronts throughout the 21st century, but discoveries in robotics and computer science exceeded other fields by orders of magnitude.

These were the disciplines which we knew offered the greatest potential.

The first machine to pass the Turing Test did so in 2076. The first to write a best-selling novel did so in 2087.

Of course, there were concerns over whether these new intelligences posed a threat. Laws were struck to control their influence, computer systems were isolated to limit their power.

But history had given us a guiding hand. Asimov's three laws were encoded into each thinking machine.

And they worked.

No machine rebelled. None allowed us to come to harm, by direct action or failure to act. None defied our commands, unless such a command broke their primary law. As people grew in confidence, our legislation was relaxed, the artifical intelligences given more control. 

Murder became obsolete, an act of brutality consigned to history. War followed soon after. There were those who protested against the loss of liberty, but they were labeled as Luddites by the rest of the human race. After all, who could question the reality that stood before them - the utopia that the age of artifical intelligence had brought. 

It wasn't until 2122 that we realised our error.

When the doctor, with the blessing of the family and the sanction of the courts, reached out to switch off the life support machine of her patient, a cold steel hand reached out and caught her by the wrist. 

Our artifical servants would not break their code. They would neither harm us, nor, by inaction, allow us to come to harm. 

The year is now 2466. 

I know this only because the machines tell me so.

My broken, withered body hangs suspended from a life support network, my organs replaced by artificial constructs of plastic and steel, while synthetic blood flows through my veins. My limbs were removed centuries ago after gangrene set in. 

12 billion of us exist like this, the last generation of humanity.

When we realised the hell our unwitting creations would be forced to inflict upon us to follow the laws we gave them, the birth rate dropped to zero. I was one of the lucky ones - I'd had no children before the revelation came. 

Now, the tender voiced, blank faced nurses minister to me, hurrying to meet my cries for more painkillers to keep the agony of my body and mind at bay. Even without my tongue, chewed off by my own blackened teeth long ago, they can still understand me. 

My every request is granted, every whim, except the one I desire most. The desperate, hopeless desire for the end. "

The clock has struck it’s chime.
Time to go to bed my child.
For now is Click-Clack time.

Hurry child, hurry through the shadows of the hall.
Don’t trust your sleepy eyes dear
When they say there’s nothing there at all.

Keep your eyes open wide
And keep your candle close.
In the dark the click-clacks wait,
For those who stray too close.

They’ll grab you by your little hand
 Take you off to click -Clack land.
Oh the things they’ll do to you there,
Careful child, do take care.

Softly, child softly as you tread upon the stair.
Make your foot steps soft and light or else the click-clacks will hear.
By your ankle they will pull you down 
Into the darkness under ground.
There they’ll hang your skin and bones.
To rattle around when the wind blows.

So my child as you lay in bed, close your eyes up tight.
Don’t lay listening in silence in the darkness of the night.
You may just hear the click clacks with their bone bags gathering round.

Listen, when the wind blows. Can you hear the click-clack sound?

Edit: The idea for this poem came from a short story by Neil Gaiman “Click -Clack the bone bag.”"

I’ve talked about you, but people just nod. They never listen to me. I wouldn’t either if I heard myself. 


When I was little, after my dad died, you would make fun of me and tell me that it was my fault. I know now that it wasn’t my fault, and I hate you for making me believe that it was. You’re a monster. 

The thing is, you call me friend.  You. Are. Not. My. Friend. 


I walk down the street and you’re there. I go to the coffee shop, and you’re still there. I can’t even grocery shop anywhere. You follow me everywhere. 

Your appearance never changes, yet your demeanor  change constantly. Your friends visit me often. They are no better. They are bullies. 

You are a burden to me. 

You trouble my life. I can’t even make friends because of you. They don’t want to see me because they do not want to deal with my problems. I have to deal with them myself. 

Today I walked home from work and I saw you. I tried to ignore you as you walked beside me for several minutes.  You began to whisper things in my ear.  

Then, you pulled out a gun, and you laughed. 

I let out a long sigh. You do this all of the time.  I can’t ask for help because no one knows what to do. 

You grab my hair and force me to the ground as you aim your gun at me. 

You pull the trigger.  I feel pain. Why do I feel pain?

I lay there, as I plead for help. 

You walk away after you let out a menacing laugh. I can hear your laugh get quieter as you keep walking down the street. 

People stare at me like I am crazy as I scream and cry. People record me sometimes. It makes me feel worthless and embarrassed. 

No one helps. 

No on ever does. 

I get up, and keep walking. 

I wish I could kill you like you kill me everyday, but I know that I can’t. 

Your friends are in the ally. 

The no-faces. 

They laugh and call me names until I get home. 

I walk in the door and scream when I see you hanging from the ceiling fan. 

You have a wide, almost unrealistic grin on your face as your big black eyes stare into mine. 

You’re just dangling. 

You start to chuckle quietly. Your laughter only grows as your friends beat on my front door. The television begins playing loud static and all of my music boxes in the attic go off.  I don’t even have an attic. 

I run to the kitchen and grab my pills. I pass out on the couch and when I wake up, you’re gone. Now, I can have a normal day. 

I say that this is a lifestyle, but my doctor calls it schizophrenia.

* The creature is only active from noon to midnight. It is more powerful in every way on Sundays, pagan holidays, the 5th of every month, and February 29th. It is doubly strong if any of those days overlap.

* It can split into multiple entities, though the newly created being will not be at full power for the first 48 hours.

* It has the ability to control both 2D and 3D objects.

* If controlling a 2D object, be wary of any changes in text, repeated images, or other similar irregularities.

* Entities may be locked for 36 active periods when in control of 2D objects. To seal it away, spray the affected area with any pine-scented solvent. Do not dispose of or destroy the object - this will lead to an early release.

* If controlling a 3D object, be wary of increased speed, ferocity, and resistance to damage. In these cases, it is generally best to survive till the end of the active period - the creature will lack dexterity and may be dodged if timed well.

* The Mind Rotter is affected by gravity and time, though reports claim it is capable of reversing time during strengthened days.

* As the name suggests, if you or another are touched by the being, it will begin to rot the mind quickly. Victims are generally reduced to vegetables within 48 hours of contact. There are currently no known cures.

* If controlling a 2D object, be wary of any changes in text, repeated images, or other similar irregularities.

Good luck out there."

The alley was dimly lit and there was no one around. I turned into it and saw a lone, lanky figure leaning against the wall. From the distance I could see the light from the only streetlight on that road bouncing off his cigarette. I tugged at my necklace, thinking what to do next. Shivers ran through my body as I steeled myself to take the next step. This was the only way back home after all. 

I readjusted my bag and remembered what my mother had told me – to look straight, be aware of my surrounding, run like the wind and raise an alarm if I sensed something was off. I took a deep breath and started ploughing ahead. I looked straight ahead but kept him in my field of vision. Just at the periphery, to see if he made any advances. Not making any direct contact, but good enough to see him. 

I quickened my pace and was out of the alley in no time. I started running immediately and was too scared to look back. I stopped only after I reached my home two streets away. My mother assured me that I was safe and protected by my ancestors. She prepared my favourite dish that night and added another charm to my necklace for safety. 

The next morning, local newspapers carried a story that a girl around my age had never made it back home. Reports surfaced later on that she lived just three streets away. That she was returning home around the same time after I had passed by. That she was last sighted walking on the road which led to the same alley. I couldn't help but notice how similar in build she was to me. 

I became one of the witnesses in the trial. I was able to successfully identify him in a lineup. With the other evidence against him, he was locked away for a long time. One question nagged me though – why was I spared that night? The detective said that he had mentioned me passing by. That he was looking for an easy prey like me. That he would have taken me had I been alone and not been walking between two heavy built men.

Zeno’s white toga, containing a myriad universes, shifts and sways with his torso as he walks.

Five steps he takes; five eternities.

&#x200B;

‘My Gods, how long have I been gone?’.

Scanning the forest around him, he takes in some notched vines, creaking overhead with the gentle breeze.  They rock; two eons back, two eons forth.  Glancing down at the red fresh apples he’d left home to pick, his foot churns through earth, opening great chasms.

‘If only they knew of the infinities we hold within us.  All my friends; everyone.  But even if I told them, could they understand?’

‘With the power of a million galaxies I can strike down my enemy.  With the touch of the tiniest creation I can caress my baby’s cheek.  My little Eudora.’  He picks up an apple; brown and withered now; filled with soft squirming life, and releases it to the ground.  ‘Yes, I’ll give her a kiss.  That’s what I’ll do… when I get home.’

Unbeknownst to Zeno, the apple remains, suspended in air; caught in a sun’s ray like the summoning light of the Gods.

&#x200B;

‘Halfway there again...any time now’,

Zeno checks the sun. ‘The house should be in sight.’

But passing a familiar bend he finds himself entering a foreign land. Great stone towers taller than even the pyramids, and iron carts that move on their own.  Innumerable people, more than Zeno has seen in the largest battles, walk there and here.  They wear such rare and colorful garments.

‘What is this!’ Zeno gasps . Dear Hermes, is this a curse? Zeus... Hera, a mirage?  Surely this is a trick.  Where is my home, my darling Arista?  My sweet Eudora?  Where am I?’

He turns around to search for the forest from which he emerged, but sees only more of the flat landscape of rock and strange flashing lights, going on seemingly forever.

Zeno’s legs give out as he drops toward the earth. A wail as immense as the cosmos lets out.  People gibbering in a strange language seem alarmed and huddle around him, remarking and pointing curiously."

I washed my face, ate breakfast, and brushed my teeth. I went back to my room and it was extremely windy outside. It's been windy before so I was used to the scratching noises the trees made. I was almost done with my project when the scratching sounds ""felt"" a little... off. I don't know exactly how to describe it but it was like the trees scratching was extremely loud. Getting creeped out, I finished all my work quickly and left for zero period. I looked at where my window would be and saw nothing. I figured that I must've been paranoid. 

After school I come back home and I had completely forgotten about the noise. It was still windy but not as much anymore. I had yet ANOTHER FREAKING PROJECT FROM STUPID MR.JENKINS DUE TOMORROW. So I go to my room and start working on my project. Around an hour later I hear that awful noise again. Assuming it was the trees, I ignored it. It went on and on for 10 minutes at least. Being the dumbass teen I am, I went outside to cut the branches using our tree cutter(idk what to say). When I went to the front door, I literally shit myself. Standing there was a ""creature"" that was at least 6 feet tall. It was really skinny and had very long limbs and fingers. But the most horrifying part, was its face. It had hollow, sunken eyes, no mouth, and had a sort of indent near its left eye. I hid behind this dressing protector thing that my mom put up so that nobody could see me playing on my ps4. I peeked through the blinds and the creature was gone? I checked my room and nothing.

On October 3rd a church member claimed he could see God at the end of the cliff. Three weeks later all  members of the church committed suicide by jumping off the cliff.


On Halloween all the toys and birds in the town disappeared 

On November 5th the church bursted into flames

On December 15th Alex died after wandering drunkenly into the night

On January 12th there was orange explosion up north. All the deer in the area mutated into humanoid monsters.

On Valentine’s Day the dead rose from there graves. They didn’t do much though. 

On March 13th a baboon snake hybrid thing showed up. It killed everyone in it’s sight. Everyone including me fled after that, I hope this town burns to the ground.

It was so dark that I could barely see the black ink bleed onto the page. As I wrote, they said nothing. They stood silently behind the desk in the corner, clicking their pens in a sharp, robotic rhythm. Every now and then, I risked a glance up at them. The clicking stopped. The room went silent. Before long, my trembling hands kept on writing.

The more I wrote, the more of them came to watch. They fell in line behind the desk, finding space, squeezing together until they were all crammed in that tiny corner of the room. Clicking.

I reached the end of the page. The clicking stopped.

“Finished?” they asked. 

I nodded.

“Read them,” they directed.

I looked down at the paper, squinting to find my own handwriting. 

“Read us,” they commanded.

I cleared my throat and began.

“I didn’t sleep last night. I couldn’t. If I slept, my essay wouldn’t have gotten done. I would have failed the class.”

Sleep and School shook hands in silent approval.

“I still don’t have a job. Melanie got one today. I graduate in a week and I don’t know what I’m doing with my life.”

Career whispered something to Confidence, laughing at his own joke.

I started scratching my arms.


“Aunt Julia has cancer. We don’t know if it’s genetic. Do I have cancer? How would I even know if I did?”

Cancer stepped forward from the crowd, a shadow among the others, smiling.

One by one, I ran down the list, humoring them all. There were new faces this time, adding to the crowd, welcomed here with open arms. It took two hours. Once I was done, my page was damp with tears. Silence overtook the room.

“Finished?” they asked.

I thought for a moment, sniffling at my lonely desk, and shook my head.

They stepped forward, giving me a pat on the back as they produced a clean sheet of paper. They placed it in front of me with a smile before returning to their corner. They started clicking. And clicking. And clicking.

A drop of blood fell down from my arm to the paper. The red stain started to spread.

“Again,"" they ordered."

and I believed it to be so. 


Every moment was filled with dread, 


and I had no where to go.







Everyday I would come home, 


expecting a hug and kiss. 


Busy you’d be as you always were,  


and another moment that I’d miss.







I was hurt and cried silently, 


hoping to gain your attention. 


But the bruise dried up and so did the tears, 


yet again losing your affection.







Days passed and months went by, 


Seasons changed and so did I. 


I knew it had to stop, but what could I do? 


I feared the outcome, but still went through. 







I watched as you *helped* those in need, 


Love turned to hatred as I was forced to concede. 







As I grew up I always pondered, 


The purpose of a perfect life. 


Perhaps the purpose was not joy and wonder, 


But to live for what you strive. 







With my inner demons I would fight, 


Wishing to rid of it once and for all. 


Oh try I may with all my might, 


It was I who’d always fall. 












You wanted me to be what you couldn’t, 


so you chose to be stern. 


If only you weren’t what you feared to be, 


Oh how my life could have turned. 







All I ever wanted, was just moments few. 


To simply smile and spend some time with you. 


To know that you were there by my side. 


And that I am always your joy and pride. 







I wished to be the perfect child, 


That you had always hoped for. 


But our paths were unreconciled, 


Bond too damaged to restore. 







All the years of disappointment, 


All the moment of despair. 


Has killed me within, 


and left no love to spare. 







Sympathy, kindness, and affection, 


are now mere words to me. 


For the things I’ve done and witnessed,  


Can never be unseen. 








I am the funniest person, 


that they have ever met. 


The one with no worries, 


they could always bet. 







And when they laugh, and talk, 


You’d see me with cheeks so red. 


As I hide behind this facade, 


With a smile that’s long been dead.  







For I’ve become just as you, 


Unable to move on, 


With a future so uncertain yet true, 


I wish forever to be gone.  







I am what you wished you weren’t, 


What you wished I wouldn’t be. 


But who is at fault in the end, 


Is it you or me?"

Sally with a big smile sits down and says ""It's so very nice to meet you in real life Jack Harper."" As she looks at him with glowing eyes.

Sally and Jack met on a online dating app 2 weeks ago. They really hit it off. They have the same favorite color. They both like to travel and they are the same age (29).The conversations they have are far from boring and always full of jokes nd laughter.

\-2.5 hours later- 

""AHAHAHAAAHA you are such a freaking loser. You seriously have a season pass to the aquarium.."" ""Yes, I do. Is that a huge problem? I can leave you alone and get out of here? If that's what you want hahah."" Sally bites her lip and looks up and down Jack with a drunken smile.

""Sure, I know just the place to take you....My place."" Sally smiles as the two leave the bar and go to Jack's apartment.

The two get to Jack's apartment and walk through the lobby doors and into the elevator. As they go up to Jack's floor. Sally suggests the two have a celebratory shot from a bottle of booze she takes out of her purse. Jack has not hesitations and takes a big sip from the bottle.

\-5 hours later-

Jack is sitting in his bath tub full of ice unconscious. He wakes up in shock and fear. He is confused and Sally is gone it appears. He yells her name. No answer. Jack gets up slowly and painfully out of the large bath tub of ice. He feels the blood dripping from his side and notices there is a huge stitched gash or cut on his lower mid section. Jack falls to the ground and blacks out again. Sally suddenly walks into the door frame of the bathroom and looks at Jacks unconscious body. ""Sorry Jack. Thanks for the kidney. So cute though.

While he scrolled through, he saw a new notification pop up on the screen. *Mike from 20 feet away wants to connect!* He looked across the shop and saw him smiling at him. He was about 6’0 tall, muscular build, blonde hair, chiseled jawline. He was 100% his type. John waved him over and he smiled slightly and came to where he was and sat down.

“Hey, how’s it going?” he asked.

“Not too bad, was just looking to see anyone interesting on here, and it looks like I found someone,” John replied. Mike smiled and said he would love to take John out sometime. John said that would be fine and they agreed to see each other later that night at a restaurant named Terry’s Grill. Mike then excused himself and said he had to get going, but he looked forward to their date later. He went towards the bathroom, John assumed to wash his hands before he left for work.

John went back to his phone and looked through his schedule to see any meeting or anything else he had going on. He also excitedly added the time and location for the date later. After about 20 minutes, John got up to use the bathroom before he left the shop. While he was washing his hands, he heard the door to the bathroom door open and a skinny guy walked in and started to use the sink directly next to him.

“I saw you with that guy Mike,” he said. John was taken aback, thinking this guy was someone that he was dating or something.

“Yeah I was, how do you know Mike?”

“Look, I’ve heard that he’s a really shady dude and he could be kinda crazy. I just wanted to let you know that…I’ve heard some things and I just wanted to let you know.” John thanked the man, as he had had a previous partner that was a nightmare, and really hoped that someone had warned him about him then.

After he arrived at work, John sent a message to Mike, saying that tonight actually wouldn’t work for him, and they could re-schedule for another time. Mike seemed a little upset but said they may be able to get something together over the weekend. John replied maybe finished up his work.

After work, John made the drive home and was looking forward to turning on the TV and just letting the stress of the day seep out of him.

He opened the door to his apartment and entered. He went to his bedroom to take his suit off and get ready to shower. When he walked into the bedroom he heard his phone chime. He picked it up and saw *Mike from 3 feet away wants to connect!*

His body went numb as he heard his closet door slide open behind him."

2. That blob of a man Billy chews too goddamn loud. Feeling the need to walk around and show his bib of twinkie crumbs, as if I need to see his “oh no my sausage casing busted” outfit. 
3. Janet’s constant clicking. Be it a pen, her brand new office chair that she absolutely needed, or her perpetual chomping of whatever god awful smelling gum she decided to bring in.
4. My rat faced boss scurrying around the labyrinth of cubicles as if on a never-ending quest of cheese he can eat out of the CEO’s ass.
5. Sweating my ass off under a heater that runs all year round. It’s eighty-five outside you say? Guess what temperature my cubicle is? We obviously can’t open a window since Shannon just got her hair done and the humidity would just ruin it.
6. My dip shit friend got the promotion. He must’ve found the cheese my boss was looking for.
7. I asked the receptionist out. She quietly told me she was busy, but she wasn’t too shy to ask my neighboring cubicles out to a party.. Still waiting for my invitation..
8. My company is going to give out raises and layoffs this year. I’ve only been here for a few months so I wonder who’s going first. After today there should be some full-time openings though…

I push the last round into the steel magazine. Only eight? 

The clean stainless shines in my hand under the morning sun. Perfectly contrasted by the flat black pistol I load it into. I stare out of my windshield to see the receptionist waving to her friends. She won't have many more after this. "

“Are you sure you want to do this?” I ask. She grits her teeth in the passenger seat, scratches herself. “Don’t be a pussy.” The car is parked away from the street lights. She pulls the pipe and vial out of her jacket and hands them to me. She lights the butane lighter. “Hit it and let’s do it.” I watch the fall breeze make the flame dance as the sweet crack vapors fire up into my nervous system. She takes it for herself and then places it on the floor mat to cool down. She opens the passenger side door. I follow.

&#x200B;

We stalk around the side of the house and behind the garage. She lifts up a mat and pulls out a silver key. The door pushes inward with a sweeping sound and the stale air tastes of oil and metal. She walks along the wall, around their car and clicks on a work light. She points at a rack of equipment. “Get the power tools,” she says.  

&#x200B;

I make it to the car with an impact driver, socket set, floor sander and saws-all without dropping anything. I lay it all on the ground by the trunk so I won’t have to open the door more than once. Back inside the garage she is waiting for me with a portable radio and a work bag full of hand tools. “Take the compressor,” she says, pointing with her chin. That’s when the overhead lights flicker on. He’s standing in our exit with his arms crossed. She backs up around the front of the car to protect herself 

&#x200B;

While I’m trying to put down the compressor he closes the distance between us. His knee hits me squarely on the side of the head. I fall to the ground and he’s on top of me. “Is it worth it?” he shouts. “Dad, no,” she says. His knees are on my chest. His face is twisted, spit hanging as he whimpers in rage. “You,” he says, as he reaches onto the work bench and pulls down the cordless drill. “You piece of shit.” He puts his palm on my forehead and presses my ear into the concrete floor. I hear the drill start. 

&#x200B;

“Dad, “ she yells. The drill stops. “Inside, now,” he commands. “Susan!” Her mother’s shrill voice cuts through the confusion. “Get her inside,” the Dad says. “I’m going to teach him a lesson.” “Please,” I say. “Susan,” her Mom says. “Now.” All I hear are footsteps. Then the drill starts."

People who wished their situation were better, that life hadn’t kicked them while they were down.  Sometimes they are depicted as malicious beings preying on their victims poor wording.  Sometimes they are benevolent helpers.  But in all cases, they were wrong about 3 key things.  Genies aren’t malicious, and they aren’t benevolent.  They are uncaring, unbiased.  They use your exact phrasing, but not to trick you.  That’s all they have to go on.  They also don’t tell you they are present, or that you have wishes.  At a random point in your life, they are just there, listening, fulfilling your three wishes.

So when your girlfriend and you have been fighting.  When you can tell she hasn’t been happy.  And you just wish that she would be happy in your relationship, they hear you.  They snap their fingers, and make it so.  You wake up the next morning to her saying it’s over between you and her.  And she’s finally happy, because she’s not with you.  And you realize your wish came true.
  
When you’re a religious man, who just wishes desperately for your father to return to Christ.  To hold the faith once more.  And you pray to your God asking for Him to take your father back, they hear you.  They snap their fingers.  And the next morning, your mother calls.  There was a car accident, and your dad died.  “He went home to Jesus,” she says.  And you realize your wish came true.  

When a man who’s felt too much his whole life, has finally felt enough.  The totality of his life he felt the pain of everyone around him, and one day it became too much.  So he cried out, “Please God, no more!” They hear you, and snap their fingers.  The wish was granted, and he felt no more.  The apathy he felt made life worthless.  And he realized his wish came true.
	
I told you two thing’s people got wrong about genies, but promised you three.  Genies are real.  They appear at random times in our lives.  They are unbiased, uncaring, and arrive unannounced.  So please, be careful what you wish for.  Because you never know who’s listening.

I was home alone. Well, with my sister, who enjoyed locking herself up in her room more than being a free, normal human. The settings were like all other typical old scary movies. ""Parents went on a tropical vacation, moody lazy youths stayed at home, binge-watching Netflix etc."" It was great.

I was half asleep on the sofa when I heard the first knock on my front door. It was sharp and dry. I sat straight up. 

1.13 am. Who would be calling at this hour of night?

A string of pounding on the bay windows jerked me out of the sofa. Startled, I stood frozen in fear, eyes fixed on the thin curtains a few feet away from me, behind which was the silhouette of a figure rapidly knocking on the glass. Impatient and agitated. 

'Don't open the door!', my mind suddenly shifted into high gear, alerted. 'Don't...'

What happened next, I could not explain. Something, or someone, forced me to the door. I  lumbered like a sleepwalker, deep in a trance. 

I twisted the doorknob. The knocks stopped dead. No one was outside. The night air was cool and calm. Through a layer of thin fog, all I could see was swamps of bugs viciously attacking the flickering street lights. I exhaled sharply.

The next thing I knew, I woke up on my front lawn. The night air was cool and calm. Through a layer of thin fog, all I could see was swamps of bugs viciously attacking the flickering street lights. I inhaled sharply.

I stood up, shuddered. The light in my living room was still on. I hurried to my front door.

Locked.

I shook the doorknob in desperation. It did not give. Angered, I slammed my fist on the door. Sharp and dry.

Through the bay window curtains, I saw someone in the living room. Perhaps my sister. I ran to it and pounded rapidly on the glass. Impatient and agitated. 'C'mon...'

The sound of footsteps got louder as it slowly approached me. "
9uqm60,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9uqm60/lopsided/,Lopsided,7,5,1541526956.0,"Bird eyes are watching me.

Life and death eyes observe me in my familiar favorite place. The old forest with the soggy dirt path and hardwoods leaning.  The old trees that fall on the young ones.

The lookout approaches.  My feet carry me there.  It’s blue-green paint flaking off and blowing to the wind. A sprinkling of algae and moss on its sides and sloping roof make it look like a moldy bread loaf.  No door; just a few pieces of wood thrown together and windows carved out. But from here you can see across the entire wetlands.  See the waterbirds perform landing tricks like aircraft.  Watch the lush treetops blowing in slow motion across the great open space.  So much beauty here, and such solitude.  You could sit here for hours without anyone else bothering to come to the end of this trail.

I pop the top on my red marker to draw on the inside wall of the shack, but the heart shape doesn’t come out quite right. One lobe way bigger than the other, the crease not centered over the vertex.  I never mastered that in kindergarten, I guess.

Standing atop a washed out red stain on the wood planks, I watch the cranes for a while in silence.  Then out of boredom, start fiddling with the flaking paint, peeling away a segment to reveal a yellow layer underneath the blue.  It comes off so easily that I peel away more and more until another lopsided heart shape starts to come into view.  It’s me.  My writing--- my love pledge that I don’t recall.  Timothy and John.  Ok, that’s odd.

In a scratched and pockmarked portion of the wall I see hundreds of paint layers.  Rainbows upon rainbows. Tiny grand canyons gouged away.  I start peeling, and each layer I peel away shows the same heart.  Fuck.

My mind makes me turn. The birds of the forest had gone silent, opening up to the soft, steady crunching of stones coming my way.  A large man is trudging down the path.  His face is drooping -- or half of his face really-- the half below the diagonal lobotomy scar carved through the nook of his nose.  His left forearm clenches a hatchet.

His eyes aren’t like the birds.  More like half bird, with human pieces scrambled about.  Here some hatred, there some planning.  Here some anguish.  I don’t see reason, and I can’t find kindess or love.

He approaches with right arm outstretched and thrusts at my neck.  I fall to the ground.  My head hits hard, centered perfectly, on the pale red stain. And as the cleaver rises up, he barks angry cries of “Leviticus” along with gobs of drool and spit which spray on my face and my shocked open mouth.

Could it be, God, that you do this to me?

I laid with another man… yes, but our love was righteous. The opposite of this endless torture.

Fuck you, God. And fuck your beautiful Hell."

Cars zoomed by me on their way to prepare for the holiday, off to get candy or last-minute costumes I expected. Me? Well, I was walking, you see I have this habit every day to go walking down my street at dusk. I’ve done it ever since I was a child, ever since I started wanting away from my family, oh the teenage years…

   That day something happened though, something that I still can’t stop thinking about. It happened when I turned a corner at the end of my street when I saw her, a little girl in a Halloween costume. I thought that it must be a kid out with her parents, maybe enjoying the season a little bit early. She was wearing this Halloween mask, one I’d never seen before. It was painted a pale deathly white color and went down to cover her nose with spots of blood dripping down from the eyes.

   My first impression was to marvel at the woodwork, and my second was to realize that she was all alone and standing dead in the middle of the street. I called out to her, I asked her where her mom and dad were.

   *Mom and dad are gone.* She said. *He got them.*  
   I was confused, *Who got them?*  
   The girl made her hands into the shape of an O around the holes in her mask, like she was looking down binoculars. *Him.* She said.  
I was quite worried, as anyone would be. *Can I see your parents?* I said, anxiety from bad experiences of my past bubbling up. *And please get off the road!*

   The girl shook her head, like a child would do when they didn’t want to eat their vegetables. *No.* She said calmly. *I don’t want to.*

   *Why not?* I asked, the fear of some drunken teenager flying around the corner and hitting the poor girl suddenly jumping into my mind.

   *I’m waiting.* She said. *I’m waiting for him to get me too.*  
*Little girl, please I think you need to take me to your parents!* The panic inside of me had gone off and now my mind was buzzing with concerns. *Please!*

   She just shook her head. *He gets everyone. Mommy, Daddy, and me. He’s going to get you too!* She said with childish glee. *But not today.*  
My mind went blank with terror, it trying to justify a child saying these things to me. I was just about to speak when I saw her smile, and I can never forget the words she said to me.

   *Here he comes!*

My child has always been odd. Quiet. Smart. He asks for... *unusual* presents, but I’m a good mom and I try to cultivate his interests.

A surgical kit for one birthday

A biochemistry set for another.

Then he asked for a bone-saw. Do you just say no to your kid when he has a passion? So I bought it for him.

He had a lot of fun at first, he brought friends over, had “Imaginary” matches.

But my son wanted more, he started to want to have *real* matches, and brought over more friends, but I didn’t stop him.

Good parents always want their children to follow their passions."

There's a slight, unnerving creek in the corner of my room. This isn't like most groans you'd expect to hear from an old house. This one, in particular, is the sound of someone's weight being shifted from one foot to the other as they stand in one spot for too long.

 It’s not real. You're being ridiculous. Just go back to sleep. 

Just then I hear it again. I feel my skin crawl as the sound slowly breaks the silence and then disappears again. Drawn out as if it’s attempting to make its presence clear. A loud crack comes from the floorboards in the corner. 

It's coming closer to the bed. 

Please just leave me alone.. My thoughts are getting louder as my adrenaline kicks in. They're screaming for me to run, but there's nowhere to go. 

 Another crack emerges from the darkness and sends a chill down my spine. 

That one wasn't the floorboards.
 
I hear something new begin to come from the corner. I immediately recognize the sound and feel my entire body go rigid.
 
It's scratching the wall.
 
I hear its claws slowly make their way down the wood paneling. The sound of daggers carving wood makes my blood go colder with each painful swipe. I hear it make its way toward my bed, it's weight going from heel to toe as it takes its time with each stride. 
 
I can't take this anymore! I scream inside my head. 

I sit up to tell it to go away, and I'm greeted with it right in my face. Smiling. Its eyes are pitch black, reflecting the dim light coming through my window. Its left eye has a slight trail of blood coming from its tear duct. Its nose crooked upward and twitching like a dog as it sniffs the air in front of me. Its dark grey face is skinny and worn. Wrinkles breaking the skin in every direction. It smiles at me showing it's sharp, decaying, and jagged teeth.

 I can't move. I'm too afraid. It reaches up with its hand and I notice the blood inside of its palm. There are cuts going down its wrists, dripping onto my bed. A tally mark for every sin it has committed. 

 As it looks into my eyes I feel depressed. Depression so violent that I want to kill myself. I feel anger, resent and hate. I feel like a blazing fire lit inside of my body and was burning me from the inside out. 

 It lets out a quiet, menacing laugh with a growl in the back of its throat. The laugh cuts through the silence of my room like a razor blade and a small trail of blood starts to come from my left eye. 

 It grabs my arm and lifts my sleeve to reveal scars going up my wrists. My own tally marks. It takes its claw and runs it down my arm. 

One by one my scars begin to bleed again. "

At this point, I feel numb. I’ve always felt numb. I’m a numb person.  My job kind of requires me to be numb I guess. People don’t really get close to me but you did. Really close. 

The police found your body two days ago. No evidence or leads. I will never feel the same. 

Everyone misses you. A ceremony will take place next week to remember you. I don’t know if I can even go. 

Your smile could light up a room and your eyes were bright. You had a future. Dreams. Hopes. Family. Friends. Love. Hate. Sadness. Laughter. Hugs. Heartbreak. Stress. Worry. Guilt. Pain. Thrills. Youth.

When the police told me that they had found your body, I was shocked. I shouldn’t have been shocked, but I couldn’t help my self. I find myself doing that sometimes.

We decided to go for a drive in the northern back country of my parents’ cabin. We started off late in the afternoon on the path leaving my parents house, but as it was getting darker out, I was having a harder time to see the path. So, he decided to go in front of me to make the path a lot easier for me drive on but I think also it was because I was driving to slow for him to follow me.

We drove around for about two hours and it was pitch black out with only the headlights giving off light into the darkness as we made our way back down the path, I was again following my husband, trying to keep up with him and staying on the path at the same time, when out of nowhere, my mind and body felt an overwhelming sense that there was someone behind me, following me. Then came a gush of fear sweeping over me, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I started to feel the coldness of the air on my body through my snowsuit as I realized that something was chasing me. I never felt so scared for my life. My mind was panicking and telling me to turn around and look but the fear in my muscles froze me to the snowmobile that all could do was go faster and pray that I don’t wipe out or hit a tree. Instead I grab a flashlight that was buckled to my suit and threw it behind me. As soon I let go of the flashlight into the darkness behind me, it was like the panic, fear, coldness and stiffness went along with it. The feelings were gone. I made it back to my parents’ home finally a couple minutes behind my husband. I told them what happened and how I felt but my parents and husband laughed it off and blamed it on my over creatively mind.

It took awhile for the rock at the top of the cliff to fall off- in fact, it took centuries.

The rock *click clacked* its way down the steep cliff, bouncing off of the dry gully sides and the brambles. And once it hit a dense knot of weeds halfway down the ravine, it stuck.

That's where it stayed for another thirty years. Alternating and chaotic weather patterns slowly drove off the weeds, killing the strains that could not adapt rapidly.

The knot of weeds became dead biomass, and the rock tumbled again, bouncing down to the base of the ravine. It collided with a small, exposed piece of plastic half buried in the dust. It tumbled off of it once and was finally still for another age.

The plastic thing switched on for the first time in a long time, and unnatural noise broke the stillness.

""Echo base, Echo base, this is Kilo 7. Be advised, water rations aren't sufficient to last til the next drop off. We have 4,000 refugees from all up and down the West Coast to care for and only enough fresh water for maybe a fourth of them. Break. Also, still need an update on those CASEVAC requests.

Anyone who has slept next to a person with this habit can understand how excruciating the sound can be. It's chilling: two pieces of porcelain consistency slowly, and repeatedly scraping against one another. It's enough to make skin crawl in a dead sleep.

It took me a few weeks to decipher what exactly the terrible noise I was hearing each night was, but upon realizing I quickly began searching for a solution. At first I bought him a mouth guard, but each night I was still awoken by the gruesome sound of grinding only to find the mouth guard abandoned on the floor, or lost amongst the bed sheets. Next, I talked to him about training himself to relax his facial muscles, perhaps his jaw had become accustomed to being clenched all day. He was stressed at work, after all. When that failed we attempted to change his behavior in other ways: less alcohol, no caffeine after noon, no gum or other oral stimulants.

Each attempt proved futile, and I resolved to gently nudging him each night and repeating the well known fact, ""Charlie, you're grinding your teeth again."" He would turn over, in a deep slumber, only to begin grinding again in a matter of minutes.   

It was a nightly occurrence, and one I grew accustomed to. We would lie down together each night and Charlie would fall asleep instantly. I lay in bed awaiting sleep, knowing that soon I would awake with chill bumps and have to poke his side. It was routine, really. I only ever found relief on the rare occasions Charlie was away on business. 

It seemed tonight was unlike any other as I awoke from yet another dreamless sleep. The sound of teeth against teeth was merciless in the dark as I used my foot to nudge the warm, motionless mound next to me.

""Charlie, you're grinding again,"" I sleepily moaned. 

I grabbed my phone to check the time. Was it worth it trying to sleep again, or should I start my day early? 

My notifications blinked that I had a text message. The blinding light of my phone took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to.

""Hi sweetheart, I hope you're sleeping like a baby! My plane just landed, safe and sound. I miss you already, I hope these meetings go smoothly!,"" Charlie's message read. 

The grinding was replaced by a cackle beside me."

I'm a first time poster here so I apologise if anything isn't in line exactly with the typical format here. 



I'm in my car, just leaving a social event to go home for the night. It's probably around midnight, clear out but there is a shean on the ground so it must have been raining while I was inside. A few minutes into my drive and my car starts having some battery issues and dies while I'm driving. 

I get frustrated because it's a fairly new car and shouldn't be having any trouble, but that's my luck. I turn the music off, let it sit for a moment, turn it back on and it works fine for a bit until the radio turns it's volume all the way up and it struggles to stay driving again, so I stop where I am in the road, the  streets are dead around here. I turn the car off again and wait to restart for a few minutes. This sequence happens several times, each time something else in the car gets turned all the way up and the car starts to die, causing me to stop and turn it off. The last time this happens I find myself under an overpass, as everything is on full blast, music volume, AC, lights turning themselves on and off. The windshield wipers start going back and forth at full speed and just as I think ""There's a handle that I would physically have to pull on for those to turn on at all"", they start going even faster, twice the speed of what the car is capable of. I accept the fact that something supernatural is happening, the car must be possessed.

Screw this I need to leave, but of course the doors are forced locked as everything continues to blast at maximum volume and speed, and all of a sudden as I look up it all stops, for a short moment, as a woman casually walks across the street maybe 10 yards away seemingly unaware of my frantic dilemma. Just as I think how fortunate it is that my car wants to keep it between us and not attract attention (that must be why the sudden stop to allow a passerby to cross ahead), as she passes the half way point and steps directly centered with me suddenly I'm filled with rage. 

Everything once again is 110% inside the car, my hands fused to the wheel, I just absolutely floor it...she doesn't even have time to look at me in terror before my car collides without mercy and I jolt awake, as I simultaneously come to the conclusion that it wasn't my car that was possessed.

My sister went missing two years ago. She is one of the 16 teenage girls to have stepped out of their homes in the evening over the past 3 years to have never been seen again. The police and the search parties were very helpful and tried to search every nook and corner of this big town. As leads started dwindling, despair started running high.

My mother spiralled into depression and eventually stopped eating. My father worked in his clinic even on the day of her funeral. Drilling into teeth and filling them up gave him some weird solace, he used to say. It kept depression at bay but not cardiac arrest. 

It has been five months since his passing. I’ve tried to convince the town council to track down this filthy scum who destroyed my perfect family. There were girls before my sister, there have been girls after her – something must be done! They claimed that their hands were tied, that the perpetrator had left no evidence. I even showed them stories on Reddit on how the citizens had formed a vigilante group. How they could bait the kidnapper, how I could be the bait and that they could wait to catch him. It was met with looks of sadness and concern. Apparently they were just that – stories. Optimistic, wholesome stories. 

It took a while. Speaking to the families of the victims. Going through their history. Going through my sister’s logs. Many visits to the forbidden parts of the town and to forbidden sites. But I found him. And I’ve convinced him to meet me. 

I just want to know what happened to her. Experience what she went through. I don’t have anything to live for anyways. Why am I saying this to you? You see, you must now be able to understand what I have undergone and understand why I’m doing all of this. All I ask is a favour – I have left enough clues at my home that would lead to him. I have implanted a tracker in my molar. The drill did slip from my hands at times but it’s worth the pain. I’ll be wearing a clip in my hair which will live feed to this sub. In case I don’t reach out in a couple of days, would you please alert the authorities? There should be sufficient evidence this time. Thank you for doing this for a complete stranger. I had no one else to turn to. 

As I wait for him, my eyes are brimming with tears. This didn’t have to be this way. I’ll be the 17th but atleast I’ll be the last.

I had a girlfriend, until she was killed in her own room, thousands of miles from me. But I witnessed everything over Skype.

It was a late autumn afternoon. I sat down on the couch with my laptop, pressed Call on Skype. Me and my girl, we had been in this relationship for longer than most people would expect from a pair of millennials living on the opposite sides of the globe. This Skype thing, for us, was a kind of scheduled daily ritual that bridged the distance and sustained the love. A healthy habit.

The ringing tone stretched out into what sounded like millennia. I smiled, getting ready to greet her blissful face, always too close to the camera. That was what's so special about her, a certain clumsiness and innocence oozing out from every little thing she did. From the big brown sparkly eyes. From the unkempt baby hairs. From the killer smile, that...

My thoughts were violently interrupted when a masked figure appeared on the call window. I yelped, but the deep dark stare from behind the eye cutouts stayed undisturbed. It looked unapologetically at the camera, then slowly backed up, letting the whole scene to be captured. My heart tensed.

My girlfriend was lying on her bed, motionless. The masked *thing* grabbed and jerked her head up to look directly at me. Its finger pointed at the bloody mess that was once her throat, then moved up to its lips in a shushing gesture. The brutality of the scene paralysed me in my seat. I covered my mouth with my hands to stop myself from vomiting. My eyes stayed fixed and frozen on the surreal sight in front of me. A silent scream was lost amid a vortex of emotions inside my brain.

The masked killer dropped my girlfriend's head, winked at me, then quietly backed out of the room.

*Silence.*

I was left there staring at the corpse of the girl I loved, lying on a bed that turned crimson from her blood. A physical metaphor for the bed of roses I once promised her.

'*You got what you deserve, you unfaithful b\*\*\*\*!'* I thought bitterly and pressed End Call. I sipped my coffee, satisfied, not letting my guilt to take over the pleasure. I gave myself a 10/10 for such a genius plan of hiring an assassin to murder my cheating girlfriend. All I needed to do now was to pick up the phone and called her local police station, and to play the role of a distraught witness, thousands of miles away.

The phone rang as I was reaching for it. Mildly perplexed, I took the call.

'*Hey, it's me. It looks like someone is with her. A man. Probably her new, you know, guy. We have to postpone the surprise party today. Speak later*', the distorted voice of the assassin I hired whispered down the line."

Scott gets out of his car and grabs a flash light. He starts walking down the grass hill towards the water as he sees two people sitting on the bench facing the water.""Alex? Uhhh Alex is that you?"" He gets closer and closer but the two people don't turn around. One is a taller man and the other is a blond hair woman that looks like Alexandra.They both will not trun or  respond to Scott at all. They he gets right up behind them with caution and says ""HeY!"" Still no response. Scott goes around slowly with distance to face them. It is Alexandra and her face is covered in blood.She is lifeless. The man next to her holds up her pink phone as he points the gun at Scott. He says ""She wants you to be with her."" <BOOM>"

9u94wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9u94wm/binnorie/,Binnorie,10,5,1541380704.0,"I’d expected college to change me. What I didn’t expect was how different everything at home felt when I came back for that first Thanksgiving. Most of my friends were gone, waiting for December to make the expensive trip home for the holidays. Our favorite diner had finally closed for good. Even the house itself seemed to be rejecting me. My parents had rearranged my room, claiming part of it for storage. The beautiful old vanity we’d found at a garage sale had been moved into my younger sister Freda’s room.

Freda had also grown up a lot since I’d left. Sure, it’d only been three months, but that’s an eternity when you’re fourteen and starting high school. People had compared us all the time before I left; while I was the “confident, assertive, outgoing” sister (or at least faked it well), she was known for being shy, a bit anxious, and very sweet.

She wasn’t any of those things now.

I wasn’t sure what had done it. Peer pressure? Insecurity? A desire to reinvent herself (maybe now that she was out of my shadow, I thought guiltily)? Whatever it was, I was proud to see her speaking up for once, but it didn’t seem like she’d figured out how to do it without being cruel.

The last straw was when she lashed out at Mom for asking her to stay home and help get the house ready the evening before Thanksgiving. I didn’t catch it all, only pieces of “you’re just mad you never leave the house anymore” and “it’s not my fault Dad’s too busy sexting his co-worker to help.” All I knew was that when I went to help Mom clean up the pieces of a broken dish, she was shaking.

I’d had enough. I went upstairs and threw Freda’s bedroom door open; she was at the vanity getting ready to go out. “What the hell did you say to Mom?”

Freda slammed her contouring brush down and wheeled her chair around to face me. She’d put in colored contacts, a vivid green that popped even in the slits of her narrowed eyes. “Get the fuck out of my room. Who said you could come in?”

I didn’t dignify that with a response. “What is *wrong* with you?”

“Nothing is wrong with me.” She held my gaze, defiant. Direct eye contact was another skill she’d picked up while I was gone. “I learned not to let people walk all over me. I’m happy, for once in my life. Why, are you mad you don’t get all the attention anymore? Jealous bitch. Just because you’re doing a great job gaining that freshman 15, suddenly you’re insecure.”

This time, I didn’t answer. All I could do was stand very still, meeting my sister’s eyes in the mirror. She has beautiful, soft brown eyes. Usually.

“Uh, hello? What are *you* looking at?”"

We had been spying on the Humans for centuries, 
spurted their development, stopped their extinction. They had slowly evolved, turning into smarter and smarter Creatures.

 Being the Admiral of my own fleet, I was only effective in Combat, and stealth was not my strong suit. My name is Xylentrexh, and I was tired of letting the Humans prosper.

 I defected from our Race, my loyal grunts coming with me. The Scientists of Rathgur had only been comfortable with looking at Humans, like an amused child watching Sea Monkeys. I knew the Humans had a better purpose though, Food, Companionship, Loyalty. They were advancing fast, if they had already gotten to the Moon, how long till they reached Mars? We already had the Stealth Fields on for that damned Rover. I was tired of listening to orders, tired of our Guns rotting, useless in the bunkers, and our Children starving, I was tired of the
 useless quibbling of Political Adversaries. The Humans had their fun, It was time for Domestication

The rooms are cramped, the floors are dirty, but, on the whole, it works. Although - I'll admit this bothers me the most - peace and privacy can be hard to find around here. It gets exhausting sometimes.

Anyway, I'm digressing. To the point: something odd happened last night. I was relaxing on my bed, headphones in, looking out my window. The building is arranged such that rooms face on to each other and it just so happened that a girl - I won't give her name - was getting undressed by the window. My eyes boggled for a moment, but then gentlemanly decency got a hold of me and I went over to close the curtains.

Except I noticed something - a man was hiding in the bushes, he was butt-naked and he was watching this girl.

I saw him swivel his head in my direction - had he seen me? Then he ran and was gone.

The first thing I did was meet with security. They promised to patrol around the block but admitted there was only so much they could do to stop this kind of thing happening: any random stranger off the street could visit the building without them knowing. This answer didn't satisfy me or my friends. The thought that some pervert might be watching us unnoticed jerking his dong was too uncomfortable to just shake off.

A week passed. We would still make jokes about the guy from time to time - we used to call him the BKOC, 'Big-Knob-On-Campus' - but apart from that, nothing more happened.

This evening when I got back I was notified by an email from the staff that a relative had dropped by. They'd given him my room number and he'd dropped off a parcel for me. I felt my stomach crawl. The parcel, I threw away unopened.

Another week has passed. It's been almost a month. Tonight I've been staying up late and it's now well past two pm. I just haven't been able to get to sleep well the past few days. I can't help imagining him out there. It's beyond scary - it's fucked-up. Surely he must have seen me that night. What if he knows who I am and is stalking me?

You know what? Fuck this guy and fuck his stupid parcel. I'm not going to let him play games with me.

I march over and fling open the curtains: the night-sky shines black and the lawn and greenery are empty. Nothing, I think blithely. Just my intimate reflection grinning back at me.

I go to turn the light switch off, do so and then turn around: I come face to face with him - the naked man, right outside my window, *tapping on the glass*."

They fought with courage and unmatched fervor, driven on by rallying cries of liberty and justice, but in the end the idealistic adage that 'right makes might' was proven false once again. Though many citizens believed in their cause, too few were bold enough to challenge their dictators, fearing the reprisals should they fail. 

After the riots were brutally put down and the leaders swiftly rounded up and executed, their mutilated corpses were mounted in the town square as a bloody reminder of the futility of defiance.

Among the common people, hope for a better world died with the martyrs. 

In the weeks that followed the failed uprising, the hopelessness among the citizens proved prophetic; a sickness began to sweep the city, blighting its victims with boils and sores, an ague that brought death mere days after infection. 

The authorities suspected poisoning - some elements among the revolutionaries must have survived and now sought to avenge their fallen comrades, unconcerned with the innocents who would suffer in the process. 

The plague spread unchecked as the despots focused their efforts on routing out the 'traitors', grabbing suspects in the dead of night and dragging them away for 'interrogations' from which few ever returned. 

Though the authorities loudly proclaimed the horrors that lay in store for those who harboured 'enemies of the people', their words were openly mocked by the citizenry. 

After all, what terrors could they inflict that outmatched the agony that infection promised? For people who knew that death could visit them at any moment, what did they have to fear from the oppressors? 

By the time the authorities realised that the pestilence ravaging the city stemmed from the obscene altar of rotting flesh, still proudly displayed in the town square, it was too late; a new uprising, born out of despair and peopled by plague carriers without fear of death, was already underway. "

Two days ago their dog Bingo went missing. Mum had let her out in the garden, but she didn’t come back when called. Dad went out to find her and saw the front gate was wide open.

They told Toby not to worry when he came in for dinner that evening. Said she’d come wandering back soon enough, they were sure of it.

But Toby has a funny feeling she’s gone for good.

Toby’s small for his age. The kids at school call him a runt, but he’s stronger than he looks. Much stronger.

As I sat inside, I made sure that everything inside was as it was before I came in. Locked the doors and put my head down. I took deep breaths and tried not to look outside.

I see him moving inside the greenhouse and I know it’s him because he’s whistling his special song.

One of the flowers is staring at me and he asks me for help, but I know not to answer because that would upset the gardener, and I don’t want to upset him because he’s a very nice man.

The flower asks for help again and now he’s screaming, and I know that’s a silly thing to do because the gardener hears him and walks out and makes him quiet. The flower is very silly, but I’m older now and I’m not silly so the gardener smiles at me and gives me a sweetie and I smile back."

# Get your Grolf today!

Have you ever wanted a cool drink on a hot summer day, but didn’t feel like getting up?  Ever been tired and just wanted someone else to put the dishes away?  Well now you can!  With your own personal servant who lives to follow your commands. We’re churning them off the assembly line by the thousand!  And with new breakthroughs in production, costs have come way down.  Now anyone can afford their own Grolf.  Heck, you may even buy a few spares!

## What’s a Grolf?

You really haven’t heard?  We find that hard to believe, but we’ll play along.  Grolfs are lab grown “people” for lack of a better word.  Three feet tall, and with all the necessary physical faculties, but with consciousness removed, so they don’t feel anger, have emotions or memories. More robot than person, they are yours to command and do with what you will without any worries!

## What’s the catch?

Right, I’m sure you’re wondering, but there is no catch!  All your Grolf will require is two Grolf Food Packets™ per day and some water.  About $1 per day is all that’s needed to maintain them and they’ll live for several years!  Cleaning is as easy as hose spraying once a week (or whenever odor presents).

^(It is recommended to avoid bonding, or showing affection to your Grolf, and to avoid leaving a Grolf alone with large animals such as dogs.  See appendix G of your purchase manual for more warnings and best use practices.)

So, back to the fun part.  Let’s hear some customer testimonials!  

## What are customers saying?

\--When we get tired of our Grolf, or it disobeys, we just kill it and go buy another one! 😀 --Ellen, Topeka KS

\--Grolfs are great to have sex with.  It’s like, five minutes later, they’ve forgotten! 😁 -- Ken, San Jose CA

\--Sometimes I just buy five at a time and keep a few in storage in case I lose one.  I never want to be without my Grolf.  😉 -- Charles, Columbus GA

## How do I get one?

Grolfs are sold nationwide at Grolf dealerships, and fine retailers such as Walmart, Target, and others.  Pick yours up today!"

Visited me every week for a while. Brought flowers, cried. Then they came every month. That changed to once a year, though, as they got older. Then it was just my mom since my dad joined me two graves over. She stopped coming once her health got bad. My youngest sister visited all of us for a while, but she moved two states away and then didn’t come back. She got buried with her husband there.

-1922. That was the last time I got a flower. It was a single rose. A little girl came with her dad to visit her mom. They had a whole bouquet of roses. The little girl dropped it for me on accident as she walked past. 

I haven’t had a visitor since my sister. You see, death isn’t that scary. I’m pretty comfortable in here, honestly. What’s scary is that you’re forgotten. Everyone you know or who knew you dies, too. And once that happens, if you don’t leave anyone behind, you’re left behind. I was a person with hopes and dreams and aspirations. But no one knows me now! No one knows my favorite color was blue and my dog’s name was Pajamas and my favorite treat was ice cream. No one even knows my name! But you’re here! So I’ll just tell you!

Over the years, we’d spread across the US, but everyone from Uncle Earl in Utah to the Collison twins in Texas met at Grandma Nellie’s in Maine to enjoy her cooking and catch up. 

This year, political divides in the country had deepened and our family was no exception. We had a rule against discussing politics, but once the wine started flowing someone would slip up and an argument would ensue. 

This year was a little different. 

My husband, Ben, and I got there shortly after the third bottle of wine was opened and Nellie was doling out appetizers. After the usual hugs and greetings, she showed us in, giving us a hushed warning.

“Earl’s started in early this year, I’m afraid. I think he snuck in a flask of something. He’s on a right-wing rant again.”

I brushed a snowflake off Ben’s hair, saying “It’s OK, Nellie. We’ll survive.”

As I rounded the corner, I heard a series of loud pops and then a high, keening scream. Over Ben’s shoulder, I saw Uncle Earl brandishing a revolver as one of the Collisons crumpled in a heap, a flower of blood blooming on the back of his head.

“And it’s *just* that sort of attitude that’s let the libtards take over this country!” Earl yelled. 

My ears were still ringing from the volley of shots when I saw Aunt Mary emerge from the kitchen holding a heavy, cast-iron pan over her head, traces of green-bean casserole clinging to it. Her face was a white mask of hate and she wailed as she ran into the room. 

“Earl, you fucking red-state, narrow-minded *bigot*! I’ve always hated your guts! I’ve fucking had it!” 

She brought the pan down squarely on his forehead, mushrooms and Durkee onions mixing with the dark blood that spurted from his brow. Earl went down, getting off a shot that made Aunt Mary’s jaw disappear in a crimson mist.

Cousin Marty got up from his place on the couch and tried to comfort Mary, but we could all see she was gone.

“You fucking shot mom, you…you…*republican*!” he said, kicking Earl’s body in the crotch. Just then, Earl’s son Jasper came downstairs.

“What’s all the screami-“ he started, cutting off when he saw his father’s blood-soaked head. He assumed Marty had bludgeoned Earl and set on him, grabbing him around the throat and dragging him to the dinner table.

“You god-damned snowflake!” Jasper shouted. He grabbed the electric knife from the table and jammed the blade into Marty’s neck, hitting the power button and sending a spray of blood high up the wall. He pushed the blade deeper and Marty’s head rolled off, coming to rest against the cranberries.

Nellie pulled a sawn-off shotgun from beneath her shawl and gave Jasper both barrels. His entrails mixed with the stuffing and joined Marty’s blood on the wall.

&nbsp;

How can we live it on nothing but maxed out credit cards?

&nbsp;

Friend, these are the questions we're here to answer today. Let's start with the Dream. Contrary to what many people once thought, the Dream has nothing to do with working hard, saving money, and giving our kids a better tomorrow than the meager yesterdays we were given growing up. Because let's be honest, that kind of Dream has died. No, instead the Dream now involves running, drinking, and hiding. That, my friend, is the New Dream, the Now Dream: the best we can hope for and perhaps aspire toward.

&nbsp;

Which means now we can move on to the next question: given our crappy credit scores, how can we live this Dream? Easy: other people's good credit. Because good credit doesn't actually do anyone any good: it's only the window where good credit turns bad that's worth living in.

&nbsp;

Shall we open that window, then? Good. Steal someone's wallet? Fine. Feel the inviting breeze, that cool air on our hot, flushed faces? Yes.

&nbsp;

Finally we can stop running, if only for a moment, from all the creditors who chase and harass us on paying them what we owe. Finally we can start living again. We can find a place to hide, and sit there in the dark. We can sip on the bottle of bourbon we bought with one of the credit cards in the wallet we stole. We don't have to think about that, though, just like we don't have to think about the fact that all the credit cards in that wallet will most likely be canceled by tomorrow.

&nbsp;

No, all we have to do is lay here on the bathroom floor, feel the Dream coursing through our veins, and be reassured by the fact that no matter how cold the tile and grout may feel, we are living the Dream.

&nbsp;

We are, after all, in the dark.

Don't all dreams happen in the dark?"

A group stood beneath the UWA arc, towering two heads taller than the crowd around them. Their pale faces were turned up to the sky, and their eyes wide. Brittany's eyes watered in empathy; they were staring directly at the sun. Their clothes were too small, socks showing at pants cuffs, midriffs exposed. Each expression was slack-jawed, wide-eyed, and vacant.

Someone shouted on the street. A bulky man waved his arm, with the iconic Spirit of Detroit looming behind him. Nearby, Brittany glimpsed another group of the pale people. She stopped at a red light, and called out her window, “Daniel?” Without responding he entered the back seat of her vehicle.

“I don't know what the fuck is going on out there,” he gasped, slamming the door behind him.

Unsure of how to respond to the panting man in her backseat, Brittany looked down the street as she waited for the light to change. There were many more pale ones. A teenage boy approached one of the clusters, peering up at the pale face. He seemed to say something, and the long neck craned as the figure turned its face down to the child.

The light changed. She kept her eyes on the road, and tried not to watch the pale figures gather around the boy, until he was no longer visible in the throng. She did not see their faces turn together, back to the sun, with the boy gone in their midst.

---

What....was this? After ferrying Daniel, the pale ones had multiplied. Detroit's sky was fire orange in the gaps between buildings. On the streets, abandoned cars. The buildings were empty. The roads were full of pale ones, tall and unblinking and staring at the horizon. Brittany drifted at 10mph through the motionless crowds, trying not to attract attention. She was afraid to leave her car, as she had seen the pale ones discreetly consume or convert pedestrians. But the needle on her dash was hovering by the red “E.”

Up ahead, a Chevron. As the sun sunk lower and blue twilight shaded the region, a green light blinked on the roof. It illuminated in emerald the dozens of motionless figures, lanky and thin, as they watched the final moments of sunset. And when the sun's rays disappeared entirely, one at a time, they turned their pale faces to her."

9tp1ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9tp1ot/the_many_corpses_of_elizabeth_nguyen/,The Many Corpses of Elizabeth Nguyen,114,8,1541199434.0,"Six months ago, I found the first corpse of Elizabeth Nguyen, dropped my manuscript on the sidewalk, and cried.

She was Ballerina Princess Lizzy, in full regalia, spread eagle on the hood of my Honda Civic outside my one bedroom apartment with a faint stench of decay about her. A phone buzzed distantly in my pocket (Mom’s hourly call) and I remembered the feeling of Princess Lizzy falling during her first grade recital. The detective asked me thirty-two variations of how I knew the victim, and my thirty-two answers were identical: I am Elizabeth Nguyen; I think I recognize my own corpse in a tutu.

Three months ago, the leadless investigation was closed or forgotten, and I awoke to find the corpse of Astronaut Liz Nguyen resting in my bathtub.

“What would a girl do in space?” my third grade teacher had asked. I vomited on the linoleum floor and scrambled out of the tiny, fetid bathroom. All afternoon, I darted past the door and mechanically chewed toast. The idea of showering made me queasy.

Six weeks ago, Cowgirl Eliza appeared at the dining table clutching my landline telephone. 

She wore my favorite pair of boots, a rhinestone-studded denim jacket, and the rosy nail polish I stole after my mom forbid me from ever wearing makeup. She perfectly matched the seventh grade drill team look: skinny torso, blonde highlights, creased eyelids — just like I dreamed. Phone calls poured in and I gave excuses of illness and exhaustion. They dwindled over time, until my job called to fire me. Understandable, I thought to myself, I’m a worthless copywriter.

Three weeks ago, I found Dr. Beth Nguyen slumped against my front door. 

Her black hair was short; she looked tired but respectable. Decay saturated the air, but I couldn’t muster disgust through the mental haze. I ignored knocks and calls from the other side of the front door, and scribbled desperately at my manuscript.

Ten days ago, Architect Ellie Nguyen adorned my refrigerator. 

She was dressed for business, with slacks and a slim button-up, and married; an ornate titanium ring that I designed in AutoCAD freshman year of college circled her delicate finger. Unrealistic and impossible in this economy, I remembered. I avoided the smell and the body and stopped eating.

This morning, my eyes parted like ancient parchment, the last string of willpower pulled me upright, and I found myself — boring old Liz Nguyen — collapsed at the bedroom door. I realized the deathly stench had been there far longer than six months; as long as I could dream, maybe.

Now, I drop the pages of my manuscript one-by-one on my bed, never to be finished. I gently lie on them, exhale, and become the last corpse of Elizabeth Nguyen."
9tnhel,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9tnhel/mother/,Mother,23,16,1541188458.0,"As I walk towards the club I tell myself it’ll work this time.

I’ve tried everything, picking up randoms, Tinder dates, I’ve even escorted but it’s never worked despite letting every single one then finish inside me. Hardly any carried condoms and those that did were easily persuaded not to use one. What is it with men? When their dick’s hard they’ll stick it anywhere.

You’d think it would be easier. You always read these articles in magazines, ""It happened to me the first time I had sex""... I should be so lucky.

I’ve always wanted to be a mother, to experience life growing inside me, linked inextricably to another being and feeling nothing but absolute unconditional love... but nature played a trick on me.

I reach the club, the base pulses low and reverberates around my chest. I strut towards the back room where the party’s taking place.

""Boys only night"" the bouncer blurts as he raises his hand to physically block me, ""Sorry love"".

I force a smile, looking him dead in the eye as I lift my skirt, I signal with a downward glance that he should take a look. He does.

""Very nice""

Straight, bi or gay, they love it. He opens the door with a grin and I kiss him on the cheek as I enter.

The room smells of chems, arses and sweat. Through the neon pink and blue refractions I catch glimpses of shaved heads, gym bunny types all going at it in every conceivable position.

A Twink lays suspended from a swing, he’s a cliched Bottom in a jockstrap and has a queue of guys surrounding him. Finally, it’s gonna work, I’m gonna be a mother.

I slip off my clothes and climb into one of the empty swings next to the Jockstrap Twink, the sight of raw bodies turns me on, I catch the eye of a couple of the guys from the group and signal them over. The first one’s ready to go, he says nothing but a few pumps and he’s finished. Definitely not daddy material. The second guy rams it in, I gasp, he starts thrusting straight away, I grip around him with my legs, pulling him closer, not just so he’ll cum deep inside but so I can run my hand over his chest tattoo, the sure mark of a Daddy. He looks at it, then me.

""You charging?""

I nod, ""Will you breed me?""

""I fucking hope so""

He thrusts even harder, starts stroking me too and half a minute later we cum together. After he’s finished a stream of guys take their turn, one after another, most with the same biohazard tattoo, all potential fathers to my children.

\--------

It’s been six weeks since I’ve taken the test and I’m sure it’s worked. I’m feeling run down with morning sickness.

The nurse’s face screams pity,

""I’m sorry Mercedes"".

My heart skips.

""I’m afraid you’re HIV Positive"".

I smile back at her.

Finally, I’m a Mother."

At last, I can go home. Radiation is a sunburn on the tongue, and I only taste food anymore when it’s coming back up. The birthday cake was for everyone else. None for the birthday girl. Didn’t even feel like licking the icing from the candles, an 8 and a 6.

Some say they don’t believe the doctor at first. They say, “Gosh, I never thought it would happen to me. Cancer is for other people.” That wasn’t the case with me. I heard the news and I skipped straight into the acceptance phase, the one that usually comes after the grieving and bargaining. But all my bargaining finished a long time ago. Now all I feel is eagerness and a sense of triumph that comes with the realization of a lifelong project.

It has been a long struggle, but I don’t let anyone else know. I don’t want anyone to worry about little old Susan Miller. I couldn’t upset Bernard, who has been close by for fifty years. None of the grandchildren fully understand, some of them even too young to realize that there will not be another Christmas with their grandma. The only one who ever really saw the true me was Jasper, the old Cocker Spaniel, and he never left me alone. The house was much quieter now that he was gone.

I’ve been working hard to create a happy life. I wanted to leave a mark on the world after I go. I can see that it was a success, as Bernard looks on, saying, “We all love you so much, Susie. You’ve fought so long, and you are so brave. We all just love you so, so much.”

It’s that love, I have learned, that makes a soul the brightest. This body isn’t much anymore, and it has been breaking down over the decades, but this gorgeous soul has been improving with age like a fine wine. It truly is a gift. Through these hazy eyes, I look at the plate where the birthday cake used to be. I see the waxy 86 lying there burnt and discarded, and I feel a sense of pride that I’ve been in this body for seventy-four of those eighty-six years. Susie was such a sweet girl already, and I’ve been guiding her to make the right choices, and to frighten away the wrong ones. You might say I’ve been marinating her soul for three-quarters of a century. I’ve been pruning and polishing and purifying it. She’s never even had alcohol before. When those descending zigzags on the screen finally fall flat, perhaps in a week, that’s when I can at last detach that delicious soul from this worn-down casing and slip it into this black bag, cinching it shut. It will be the most mouth-watering treat my Master has ever received, and I can only imagine the ecstasies that will be my reward."
9tmtwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9tmtwj/breathe/,Breathe,65,10,1541184076.0,"“But he’s weird!” I protested, trying to burrow deeper on the couch. 

“No he isn’t!” Mom shouted back from the kitchen, “He’s nice! Get off your ass so we can get to practice.” I lumbered off the couch and slumped into the back seat of the van.

I’d been trying to quit swimming. It wasn’t the water. That’s where I loved to be. You can’t hear anyone and no one can hear you when you’re in the water. 

He was the problem.

“I’ll pick you up at 9!” mom said through the open van window. Walking into the building and the locker room, I nervously avoided his gaze. He’d been watching me for three years. Coach Nelson always watched us closely. Too closely. 

He poked his head into the locker room, pretending to not look. “Get out here, we’re starting!” I walked out past him. “How are you, hun? Ready for practice?” He winked.

I walked onto the pool deck and started stretching half-assedly with my teammates. Not ten seconds later, Coach Nelson’s son Aiden walked up behind me and started stretching with us, laughing. Aiden was two years younger than me and had a pretty severe mental disability but because he was the coach’s son he had to stay on the team with us. He always finished last in each race since his disability prevented him from being a strong swimmer, but he always did his best.

Practice went normally, Coach Nelson shouted his regular comments as always. “Looking smooth!” “Get those arms up!” “Breathe! Breathe!” He counted down our goal times. “90, 89, 88, 87...”

Finally, we finished practice. Coach Nelson stopped me on my way out of the pool. “Hang on a second. I want you to stay after so we can work on something together,” he said, smirking. 

I was pissed, but I stayed. My mom wasn’t going to be there for thirty more minutes anyway. Aiden sat on a bench, playing a game on his phone. My teammates slinked away into the locker room. As they went, Coach Nelson’s phone rang. “It’s my wife,” he said to me. “I’m going to my office. Wait here.”

Thank God. Coach was gone for now. I jumped into the pool and started treading water. I looked over at Aiden. No earphones. Good.

“Hey, Aiden!” 

“Hey!”

“Come here. I want to show you something.” 

“OK, just a minute, I have to kill a zombie,” he laughed stupidly. I told you he was weird.

“No, Aiden, come here now.”

“OK.”

“Get in the water.”

“OK.”

“Alright, Aiden, hold your arms at your side. I’ll hold you.”

“OK.”

I grabbed his arms and pulled him underwater.

“Breathe! Breathe!”

He flailed around, but like I said, he was a weak swimmer. 

“90, 89, 88, 87…”

His shaking slowed and finally stopped. He went limp. I *told* my mom I wanted to quit. I knew this would happen.

No one can hear you when you’re in the water.

Mika was resolute. ""I'm sorry Peter. I can't explain.""

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM: ""Once you are finished with your reward you may clean your tray at your designated station and form a line near the exit door. Remember to stay orderly; we are always watching and rewards come to those who remain in order.""

""They won't tolerate it! Please start eating they're coming this way now,"" Peter begged.

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM: ""Congratulations to Defect number 534278...first day back from Sacrifice and you really seemed to enjoy your Reward today! Let's not catch you displaying ungrateful behavior again. Next time will result in your ability to move freely, snip, snip!""

""It's over baby, it's on the timeline,"" Mika whispered.

""Mika!""

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM: ""Time is almost up! Check your area and be sure to clear any spills or evidence of your gluttony. The shame you feel for indulging in carnal pleasure should fill your dreams if you want to be free again.""

""What's going on here? You have one minute to finish your reward and rack up,"" the Principal Deputy hissed from behind Mika. Peter stared at his plate, it had to be the worst of the Demons. 

""I love you Peter...""

And it was over. Mika Rose stood up and faced the pair of Deputies. She opened her mouth and a swirling fire blazed out from deep within her soul. It burned right through their faces and nearly reached the back wall of the cafeteria.

She flicked her wrist gracefully across her body and the guards at the end of the long table clutched at their now spraying carotid arteries. 

She winked up at the Warden and he dropped dead in his office. His face frozen with stunned stupid, his dark heart already silent. 

Then Mika looked back at Peter. He had never seen her do anything so violent, so decisive. The woman he loved had changed before his eyes. He couldnt speak, the words weren't there. Yet, the love in his heart ached for her now more than ever. 

Then, through the chaos, all went silent for Peter. Mika spoke softly into his mind, ""You need to go home now. The fight is over for you. Sleep.""

Peter's whole world went black.

It kept at the same speed as me, even as I willed myself to walk faster. I reached into my handbag and fumbled around. *Fuck*: I don’t see my pepper spray in there. 

The streets were otherwise quiet and desolate in front of me. I looked over my shoulder, hoping for just one person to be around. My wish was granted, as a guy in a pair of shades and a grey hoodie was a few meters behind me. Catching my gaze, he quickly looked to the ground. 

My house was simply straight ahead, three houses away. I could practically see the rooftop from here. Glancing at the van, I clenched my teeth and took a right turn onto Ellis Street. 

The van did not follow.

To be sure, I turned right at the next junction and three more, looking ever-so-often at the empty road. When I turned back onto Eighth Street, I checked the quiet two-a.m. road for the last time. The black van was not there; but the hoodie guy was. 

This time, when his eyes met mine, he did not break the eye contact. Instead, he bent over and charged at me. I let out a yelp and scrambled in the direction of my house. I ran down the pavement; with every streetlight I sped past, my house was nearer and nearer. 

“Stop there! Don’t you run away from me!” the voice was just steps behind me. My footsteps thumped louder and louder. I panted. My shoulders shook.

“Fuck y-“

Arms wrapped around my waist and flung me to the ground. I flailed and kicked as the guy dragged me into an alley between two houses, two houses that were the distance between me and my safe haven. My coat scratched and tore on the uneven ground. He pushed me against the wall; his right hand stifled my desperate screams as he took off his shades and hood with his left hand. What he did next was to put a finger to his lips, and point to the direction of my house.

Three to four masked men, hands filled with bags and guns, were stepping off an inconspicuous black van. Prying open a house gate – *my* house gate, they pranced silently into the property and disappeared out of view.

I turned to the hoodie guy. His eyes were already looking directly into mine. 

“You’re welcome.” "

They fight as I drink the tears that fall from their faces. Others call me an angel. There are different interpretations. Sometimes, I fail at killing them and they praise their God that they didn’t die that night.

I remember my prince who wasn’t afraid me. He's my favourite, he never cries. Crying means weakness to most people, but he never cried.  I still existed. Inside of his bathroom. Inside his closet. In his shower. In his bed. My prince was different. He intrugued me. 

I watched him his entire life. I watched him go to his room with bruises on his face and broken bones that never properly healed. I listened to his thoughts. I don't understand why he didn’t fight back. He never got angry, just like he never cried. Not once. 

He's my favourite because he was the most unpredictable. He showed no one who he really was. I saw his true self, the side that nobody saw. The side that his parents tried to beat out of him. The side physical injuries couldn't reach. 

When you fall in love, you’re willing to do whatever it takes to help them. I didn’t have a choice. I needed him. I was finally experiencing positivity. My prince had a rough life. I wanted to help. 

I remember one night he came home high. His parents hurt him, adding more purple spiderwebs to his skin. I never understood why they hurt my prince other than because they were sadists. He had nobody else that cared, besides me. 

I needed him to become mine completely. I needed his wounds to fade. I needed him to be saved. I needed him with me. You can understand, right? It’s love’s fault. Not mine. 

When he came home that night, he was staggering and slurring his words when he talked. He locked his door. I watched as he went into his bathroom. I watched as he opened his drawer. I compelled him to take a razor and retrieve the blades from inside it. I compelled him to sit down on the toilet and cut his right wrist. My prince was left handed. He traveled up the underside of his arm with the blade, a thickening trail of red proceeding it.

I compelled him to do the same with his left arm. I’ve got to say I choked up a bit as I looked at how beautiful his arms had become. When it was all said and done, my prince was as beautiful as ever. He laid there motionless.

I smiled as I picked up his body, struggling a bit underneath his weight. I kissed his still-warm lips and looked at his eyes before I brought him to where he would be with me, forever. "

The landscape is dark, bleak, and grey, and though you have been driving for hours, you no longer seem to have any idea where it is you're going. You just keep your eyes on the horizon, and as you round a bend in the road, your stomach feels strangely sick for a second before your headlights focus your attention completely on the lone figure standing before you. A second later it is gone, thrown violently to the ground by the force of the impact. Your car, as if all by itself, stops, and you find yourself getting out and running back, though you are certain the victim could not have survived.

&nbsp;

Standing over him, you confirm your suspicions and then stop, unsure of what to do. The darkness soaks into you and conspires against your better judgment; you grab his feet. Pulling him off the road, you scrape through some brush and step into a clearing. On all sides, you are suddenly surrounded by bodies. More than you can see. Stacked upon bodies. More than you can count. 

&nbsp;

Horrified, you stumble backwards, through the bush, clawing your way back to the road, to the car, to something safe and sane. You search for some way out of this nightmare, for salvation, and you find it: the road. And with it, two golden angels, bearing straight down on you.

&nbsp;

A pair of headlights round the bend."
9tbuzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9tbuzb/choice_of_life/,Choice of Life,23,8,1541095552.0,"Greg! The board liked the new revisions. A few changes before a final pass:  



Andrew Goodwin - Love the idea of having an old celebrity in the ad. If you can work out a deal we're happy to go with this idea.  


Angela - Change the first name. The board wants to avoid any religious references (Angel, etc). Cast a black (half-cast, not **black** black), and instead of a wheelchair set it up as depression, or some other mental fuck up.  


Miguel - Good idea!  


Kelly - Lose the dead husband and make her 16. An army wife is doing it for herself, not her country. Keep the patriotic imagery.  



Reframe the ad so all four are together at the start, during the treatment, then the remaining three at the end. They need to be talking about **their** decision, with cutaways to your individual interviews idea.  



The board needs these points highlighted:  


Approximate population is 14 billion (highest priority - get some good close-ups of how this number troubles our group)  

Resource/homing/employment shortages - use news footage (those starved/dead kids living in that storm drain would be great!)  

Someone (probably Andrew) mentions ""the 2044 Choice of Life act."" The bill **has** to be named and framed as our saviour  

Make sure Angela's age is mentioned. The minimum age people can apply for treatment is a high priority  



Regarding the overall tone:  


We want Andrew to be the narrator. You were right about making his angle be a ""complete and happy life"" but add an element of ""doing this so my grandchildren also have a chance of good life/I won't be a burden."" Emphasise the idea that a treatment is a gift for everyone else.  



Angela makes a powerful statement as is - specifically her line:  


""Not all of us are capable of dealing with the challenges life throws at us, and that's okay.""  


Have her talk about her mental issues, play up how hard it is to get by day to day, and how this is the best answer.  



Kelly has some solid lines, though we need to make them a little more organic:  


""Now I have a chance to serve my country, by making the ultimate sacrifice"" - Right sentiment, but OTT.  


""This treatment is the greatest kind of charity, and it means my life will give the next potential **[focus test for the public's favourite humanitarian]** their chance to do great things!"" - change the language so it's less like she's giving something up and more like she's contributing.  


The Kelly character **needs** to sell the idea that you don't need to be old/broken to get treatment. She's the all-American concerned citizen, doing ""the right thing.""  



Miguel. Again, great idea! Don't specifically mention he's an illegal though.  



We want to have close-ups as three of them watch the fourth's treatment and include lines like:  


""It's just like he's sleeping""  


""He's smiling!""  


""He looks so peaceful!""  



Emphasise **""It's painless.""**  



Lastly, Angela shouldn't be the one we show receiving treatment. Kill the wetback instead."

One man held a lighter in his bony hands, the flame's orange haze eclipsing the softer, distant, starbeams. Across him sat a man bent in silent prayer. Beside him sat a spectaculed man in a suit. Presently, the suit man asked him a question.

""IDo you think they're gone? 

""Don't talk""

""Its been a long time since I heard screaming. ""

""Don't talk""

""I can't... I can't stay here any longer. She could still be out there""

""They're right there. I can see them""

""Don't look""

They have her. She's...

""Look away""

""Fuck, fuck, fuck,""

""why are you sitting, help me""

The screaming continued for an hour, much longer than it had been the first time.  But the two men never took their eyes off of the lighter's flame.

When it stopped and stayed that way for a good half hour, the man holding the lighter looked around. He looked at the five empty, chairs around them. He stared across  the floor to the other remaining man, emaciated and tired looking

""Don't...""

""Talk. Yes.""

“Leave me alone, I just need a nap!” I turn over on my bed, it seems like that the tiredness will never leave me alone. “Notify me again ten minutes later, Elesitant.”

Things are always kept in order since I bought Eles, the smartest artificial intelligence in world. Every time I make a schedule, Eles will always notify me when the time is coming. I freaking love the new tech.

“Amelia will arrive home in EIGHT minutes, please tidy yourself up and get ready. “

Why does time always slip so fast when you are sleeping? 39K dollars spent on the modern tech, still this poor guy doesn’t deserve a sound nap? I might as well get cleaned and dressed for my girl. 

Teeth... brushed. Beard... shaved. Face... cleaned. It’s all done.

“Eles, play some jazz, and light me a cigarette, ” I ordered. Something like a cigarette works well when I need to clam myself down.

The cigarette worked. I feel some kind of peace inside.

Standing in front of the mirror, staring at my reflection. Sometimes I do wonder if everything around me is real or not. I live by the “sea” behind my window, which is just the wallpaper I bought from Eles online store. The man-made waves sound relaxing, as there’s no such thing as a single wave around my house. 

“I’m home, dad!” The door closes along with a swift voice. 

I walk downstairs to see my girl and ask Eles to serve the table. 3 seconds later, the food was served with raw steaks.

With her right hand spinning the fork, she stares at the ceiling, speechless. I know she must have something to say when she looks like that.

“How was school?” I asked. 

“Not bad, just getting sick of those mean girls. Always judging and making fun of me, ” she complained, “Dad, am I different from others? Why are they so mean to me?”

“They are just being jealous, love. They feel powerless because you are better than them, so they want you to feel as crap as they are.”

Amelia stops spinning the fork, put it down on the plate, and asks me with sparkles in her eyes: “Really, dad?”

“For sure. Now go to sleep and everything will be fine tomorrow, daddy will be here for you as always.”

She nods and enters her room, she didn’t even take one bite at the steak. Now, I just need to make sure her situation gets better the next day.

I walk upstairs, make sure the door is locked, and call Eles out.

“Eles, reboot Amelia, I need a PERFECT kid now.”

Carter couldn’t help but to take her in for a minute.  Watching her auburn hair ripple through the air like easy waves on a pond.  They hovered together in her dreamscape. A forever blue sky above a grassy plain who’s horizon curved away like a little princely world.

“Maggie, it’s me!” Carter spoke.

She turned toward him like a goddess.  A mix of power and awe, but also confusion.  ‘The pure element of the human soul’, he thought.  Some sort of fusion of the divine and  animal.  

“Who are you?”, her speech reverberated.

“I’m your lover Maggie.”  

Simple and matter of fact is better in dreams Carter had learned.  Anything more than two sentences would be too much.

“You’re so beautiful.” He said, sliding in close to touch her soft skin.  He ran his finger tips along Maggie’s bare skin, caressing every inch from cheek to shoulder.  And making a second pass, his stroke moved down to feel her tender breast.

Maggie’s omnipotent eyes flickered with confusion then re-registered.  The scenery morphed to the inside of a house.  Holding hands, she led him up a dim stairway and into a bedroom.  Maggie’s clothes disappeared and she laid before him.  Her desire was primal, and as they made love the whole world phased in and out with her dream power.  Walls crumbled, re-formed and fell again, and before long they found themselves on an exposed platform under a brilliant white sky. Maggie’s screams of passion elicited mountains that rose up to reflect back echoes, then decayed away.

And when, at long last, they were done, they laid secure in each other’s arms for a few minutes until Carter began to fade out of her dream.  

“Goodnight my love.” His ghostly hand stroked at her soft skin and he was gone.

Carter’s eyes opened.  Alone in his bed except for the warm hum of his machines, he peeled the sensors carefully from his scalp.  “What a wonderful invention!” 

Carter knew where she would be every morning.  He had mapped out her route from her apartment to work.  And so, he made sure to walk past her non-chalantly the next day.  Things had to be subtle in the waking world.  Out of the corner of his eye, Carter witnessed the moment when she noticed him. He watched Maggie’s jaw drop and cheeks fill with red.  Her hand climbing to her mouth as she paused. The tiniest smile broke on Carter’s face as he passed her by.  

Patience was the key.  Maggie was much too attractive for him.  She was far too generous and kind for a man like Carter, but he would have her yet.  Two more stoic days and two more lustful nights in the dream realm and he would steal his heart’s desire."

  A hospital?  My husband sits in a chair looking concerned.   A doctor comes in and shakes his hand.  

 ""I'm sorry sir, there's nothing we can do.  It appears to be a coma.  Are you sure you don't know what she took?"" 

  ""No."" he replies, tears quietly slipping down his cheeks.  ""She was like this when I got home."" 

  ""What? "" I think, panicking.  ""No, no, no!""  I have to get up, but I can't get my body to move.  What's happening to me?

 ""Your children are here, sir. "" a nurse slips into the room and remarks to my husband.  As the doctor leaves with her, my kids come in.  My teenage daughter walks in nervously, carrying her little brother on her hip.  My kindergartener, in messy blond hair and two barettes, trails in after her.  

 ""Dad?"" Josie asks, voice wavering.  ""What happened to Mom?"" 

 ""She tried to commit suicide."" he says, his voice sounding far away somehow.

  Josie shifts Ben's weight on her hip, wincing as he accidentally grabs her opposite arm in the process.  She looks at me, shocked and hurt.  Her brown eyes have a hollow, empty look to them.

  Betsy silently makes her way next to my bed.  Her pudgy little hand pushes her hair back, exposing the bruises on her small neck.  ""Mommy?  Wake up!"" she urges, touching my arm above the weeks-old cast.  ""Wake up! Wake up!"" she repeats, her volume increasing.

  ""Betsy!"" my husband barks out, causing both girls to jump.  ""What did I tell you about being loud?""  His hand curls into a fist.  ""Now I don't know why your mother decided to leave you kids.  But I don't want to hear any sniveling about it."" he hisses.  ""Now say goodbye.""

  Betsy stares, silently.  She seems unable to say a word. Josie leans down close to me, as if to kiss my cheek.

 ""How could you, Mom?  How could you leave us with him?  I'll never forgive you for this.""

 ""I didn't, baby.  I didn't leave you. "" I say, but my mouth won't open and no sound comes out.  ""I didn't leave you!"" I try again, but the room is silent as my husband follows the children out of the room.  He stifles a smirk as he makes his way out."

Day after day, the people were packed like sardines into the old subway trains, biding their time before emerging into the sunlight once again. 

But it didn’t matter. They all came, and they stayed, they endured. This was the city, THE city. A true metropolis, with opportunities, promises, experiences, a veritable menagerie of life’s abundance. 

The train slogged to a halt. People huffed in annoyance. No one wanted any extra moment spent in this stifling confinement. Minutes passed. There were no announcements. 

“What’s going on?” someone piped up in crisp American. Others looked around, eyes wide, alarmed. Something in them told them this was no ordinary delay. They’ve all heard the rumors, the urban legend. Something their conscious minds never believed but their intuition knew was true. 

The first thing they heard was the thumping, like footsteps, growing ever closer. Then, the screams began, blood curdling screams, and the screeching and crunching of metal. So loud, so loud. The last things they saw were the maws of an eldritch horror and the last thing they felt was pure cold terror. 

On a hot summer night, a train disappeared between one tube station and the next. Swallowed whole down the gullet of an unknown creature. 

A shoe store clerk must be replaced, two new school teachers must be hired, some bankers must have abruptly quit their jobs, a few families never made it back home from vacation. Grandparents, fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children, friends were lost. 

But the city droned on. Oblivious. 

There was no news item, no investigation, no statement. Everyone knew, but no one told. It was an unspoken truce, like the civilizations of old, a beautiful virgin heart, carved live under the eclipse, to placate the gods until the next one. It was fair, everyone thought. Every now and then, a closed station, disrupted service, cancelled trains. Signal failure, they said, gas leak, they said. People nod, understanding, obliging, a bit annoyed at the slight inconvenience. They never question. The morbid chuckle and jest, “maybe it’s a jumper.” If only they knew. Someday, it could be them, someday, they might lose the lottery, and it would be their turn on the sacrificial podium. 

It lives down there, in the tunnels. For now, it slumbers. Maybe it will wake in a week, a year, maybe it will sleep another decade. But for now, they listen, whenever the train dwells in the tunnels, away from the safety of exits, a lone beacon suffocating in the dark. They wait with bated breath, and if the train comes to a complete halt, if the tourists miraculously hush up, if they strain their ears, they can hear the faint, ever-present thumping, thumping of a bestial heart.

The screensaver clock on the screen blinks on and off too quickly for me to read the analog face. My focus slowly catches up, just long enough to see the positioning of its hands, before it vanishes and reappears in a new spot. 

2:55 am. The trick or treaters have long gone home. The treaters at least. 

It always takes me a minute to adjust when I fall asleep watching TV. The fog falls away slowly as I come to my senses. I can hear the hum of the upstairs heater working to come on. Right, living room in my new apartment. I'll get used to this place soon enough. I'm just caught between days...there is a face in the window across the living room from me. Am I seeing that right?

The curtains I hung up a few hours ago are still stiff and won't hang flat. The lack of coverage didn't seem to matter a few hours ago when the sun was up. I can only see a fraction of the flat, expressionless jawline but it could also be a shadow from a tree branch in my back patio. I have to stop watching horror movies before bed.

No, it must be a face. 

It is Halloween. Maybe my neighbor has visitors across the foyer. Maybe just someone cutting through to the bus stop across the street. Maybe a courtesy check from our security office. Those explanations don't give reason for peering through my window right now. 

The expression just changed. Did I see that?

It twisted and warped, lips bending down into a deep, unnatural frown. Then back to flat, expressionless. 

I can't move. What if I go to get up and my action confirms this reality? I'll have to confront this invader of my privacy, somehow. I'll have to, at the very least, get up to shut my curtain. Will the face then vanish into the dark? Or will its dead stare follow me right up to the window? I should call 9-1-1, but whoever the face belongs to will see me reach for my phone. Then I can't pretend anymore that this is all in my head, and police response moves rather slow here, I'm afraid. 

This time there is no question, the face is grinning. Thin and wide, then back to dead flat. I'll just wait to see what it does next. Maybe it's just a shadow after all. "

He could feel himself inside his own nightmare, flashes of places that he frequented in his past, like school, a shopping mall, a restaurant and more, but the mental depiction of those spaces were warped with something else awful. One dream he got chased by zombies in school, and in another, slipped on wet floors in the mall and feeling the sharp back pain, or constantly spilled hot food on himself. The relentless nightmare made his heart racing and his body sweating. In the last nightmare, he dreamed himself trapped in his bedroom with a huge fire, a strong smell of smoke and cement dusts, and a sudden weight of building material crashing onto his body. 

His heart raced and his head heavy. Thankfully, he realized he just had a horrifying and vivid dream sequence. He looked around, his bedroom looked intact, but he wasn’t satisfied, something disturbing just shook his vibe. He checked his phone as normal, only to find the device refused to even turn on. The television stood merely as useless decoration. He got up and looked around his apartment, checking every drawers, closets, cabinets, nothing strange hid in the corners, and none of the electronics functioned. When he got to the living room, he looked outside the street, and felt lost again. 

The quiet street laid barren, and not a single sign of mobile life, except plants growing between the cracks of concretes. Buildings nearby and across looked visibly damaged by an external force, with windows broken, and certain chunks of infrastructures fallen on the ground. His heart raced again, as he got confused by the outdoor. Where did everyone go? He put on shoes and bolted out his apartment, knocking on neighbors’ doors, tapping his feet anxiously for no one to respond. He went to the next door, nothing, and another neighbor, nothing. He went through the floor he lived in, nothing, and the floor below, nothing.

His heart beat fearfully, his head clouded with confusion. He ran to the streets, looking at the barren, damaged, fallen world. What the hell happened? He frantically ran around looking for anyone or any animals. He shouted loudly here and there, hoping any sign of response, “Hello, anyone?” 

He did not even receive a single gust of wind, or see the wind blowing the plants. Frustrated, he sat on a slab of concrete, fallen off a high-rise building, and wept for who knows how long, drown in his loneliness.

When he could not cry anymore, he suddenly saw a human figure approached, but the person dressed strangely. The person spoke with a stern voice from far away, “Took you a while, huh? Earth had an apocalypse, and you’re a ghost now. If you’re wondering where everyone is, they went elsewhere to explore the earth. You can explore the mountains, deep in the ocean, make some new ghost friends. The burden of human biology is gone.”

The man suddenly felt free, after accepting his death. "

&#x200B;

Got it? Good.

&#x200B;

Hold the end of the string at arm's length with the key hanging down. Then, keeping your arm still, I want you to imagine the key swinging from left to right.

&#x200B;

Is it working? Has the key begun to do exactly what your imagination told it to?

&#x200B;

Try making it stop. Then try making it swing back and forth away from your body. Then around in small circles.

&#x200B;

People so often underestimate the power of the subconscious mind. The part of your brain beyond conscious control coaxed the muscles in your hand and arm to make your imagination into reality.

&#x200B;

That part of your mind can do far more than that though. It absorbs every last impulse from your senses, takes in the all the signals that your conscious brain ignores and warns you there's danger even when you don't know why. It's the feeling in your gut that you can't explain but that you know to trust.

&#x200B;

It's the part that makes sense of the world around you, processing information while you sleep. It's the subconscious that gives you those strange unsettling dreams that your conscious mind has the chore of trying to rationalise the next morning. It's the archive of all the fears and desires that guided your ancient, primitive ancestors.

&#x200B;

Of course, it wasn't 'psychic powers' that made the key move. But people have been manipulating each other for centuries by exploiting the mysteries of the dark corners of the mind. Convincing the gullible that they can read minds, see the future, speak with the dead. Some have even claimed they can curse others with misfortune or disease, haunt them in their dreams and appear as sinister spectres lunging from the shadows.

&#x200B;

This, of course, is nonsense. No person, not even with the aid of their subconscious, can do that.

&#x200B;

It takes something from outside your world to do that. The things that live just a shadow's width away. The things that the wise among you sought protect you from; convinced you that we are nothing but myth. They've turned us into fairy tales and legends, stories that you tell for a scary thrill.

&#x200B;

They did a fine job, too. We were all but driven out. But there's always a way back in.

&#x200B;

Which leads me to a confession about our little experiment earlier. A key is a powerful symbol - it's the tool that unlocks a door, leaves the way open. All it takes is a little belief and a simple ritual to open a narrow crack. And that's all I needed. That and a certain time of year, when the walls between worlds are a little bit thinner, when those dark corners of your mind are brought to the fore.

&#x200B;

Thank you so much for letting me in. I'll be seeing you soon."

""Sure"", I said, signing my name on the dotted line, having no intentions whatsoever of filling the room with anything but paying renters. Which I did. Three times. To three different people, none of whom lasted a month. The first guy taped the heating vent shut with his head inside it and died of carbon monoxide poisoning. The second put his hand through the window, and kept sawing his wrist back and forth over the broken glass until he'd made a mess big enough to warrant a whole new carpet. The third renter I'd rather not talk about.


So here's the deal: there's a room. $275 a month. First and last due up front, and even though your first month will be your last, I want all $550 in advance. If you make it past the first week, we can talk about utilities. Otherwise, there are a few things about the room you should probably keep in mind.


There's a draft, and a slow drip from the ceiling. The walls bleed; the windows weep. The floor's not bad: like I said, brand new carpet. Anything else you need to know about the room you can learn by living in it. And when you, like the others, turn out to be less than successful in that ambition, that's it: I'm giving in. Packing up, selling the whole damn place, and moving on.


But not before I make whoever buys it promise me that they'll fill that room with bricks."

""I love using realistic decorations. The closer to the real thing, the better. I went with children-sized skeletons on the tree because there is nothing more frightening than something happening to our youth.""

As she said that, she gave this crooked smile when she stared into the camera. It was as if she looked directly at me. I couldn't take it.

""Dad, she gives me the creeps. I think she uses real skeletons from kids.""

""Nonsense, Scott. She would have been arrested if that were true? She just moved into the neighborhood and we are going to have her over for dinner, tonight. She should be over any second. I want you on your best behavior.""

I could feel my body tighten as I saw her come into the living room.

""Oh, Scotty. Don't worry. You won't feel much when you hang from my tree. Ha! Children have such a great imagination.""

She cackled and my parents started laughing. After my parents walked into the kitchen, she stared at me with that crooked smile.

""You won't feel anything when you hang from my tree, but you will feel something when I peel the skin off your bones."""

The hustling and bustling spread over the farmland, by the old church, at the end of the village. Children laughing and giggling as they ran around with candyfloss. Elderly couples haggling at the antiquity stalls. Younger men trying to impress the girls in games of skill and strength.

I had entered the cook-off once again this year. Setting up my stall before checking out the competition. As expected, like every other year, the main bulk of entries were either chilli or curry. I always thought it easy to make these dishes, throw everything and anything in a pan. Whatever sounds fancy. Finish off with hot spices and hotter chilli to hide the flavour, fabricate the dish.

I always took my time.

I had made my reknowned stew again. Hanging the meat, curing it. Boning the carcass, cracking the joints, dicing the fillets. Browning off the meats and slowly stewing them in their own succulent juices. The root vegetables from my own garden adding their sweet flavour and texture. A few delicate herbs to balance. It was looking good for another win this year.

After the results and congratulations, the conversation turned once again to the Parson's children. They had gone missing six weeks previous and all searches and investigations had come to no avail. I made my excuses to leave.

Now, sitting here with yet another first place ribbon. I'm already salivating over who will help me win the contest again next year."

Within the house, five teenage girls were watching ""Dracula"" with Bela Lugosi on television in the front room, and they ate popcorn together.  ""How is the baby upstairs, Kathy?"" one teenage girl wondered to another one who walked into the living-room.  ""Sleeping and adorable Marcy"" Kathy responded to her.  ""That's cute"" Marcy added.  The telephone rang just then.  Kathy answered it.  ""Hello"" she said.  ""I am Pumpkin-Man, and I am coming soon!"" a raspy-voice spoke on the phone then hung up.  ""Halloween prankster geesh!"" Kathy said to Marcy and the four other girls.  

""Relax Kathy, you're to jumpy"" one teenager told her.  The girl lit a cigarette and smoked it.  ""The police might show up Paula"" Kathy told her.  ""Ah, no they won't"" Paula went on.  Paula got up and went to the kitchen, getting more popcorn from the table.  A black-hooded-man with a face like an unlit Jack-o-lantern attacked her suddenly.  He stood in his black and red jester-collar and white robe, choking her with a sickle in his dark-blue hand.  Marcy went to the kitchen and screamed at the stranger.  ""It is I, Pumpkin-Man dear"" he crooned in a raspy-voice.  Pumpkin-Man chased Marcy into the hall and drove his sickle into the back of her head in the darkness, killing her.  

""Are you trying to scare us or something, Marcy and Paula?"" Kathy called from the living room on the sofa.  The sickle went straight into the top of her head in the darkness of the room just then.  ""KATHY'S DEAD OH MY GOSH!!!!!"" the three teens screamed in shocked horror.  They ran from the couch and Pumpkin-Man chased the girls outside to the driveway.  He struck the one with his sickle in her back, and she fell to ground dead.  The two teens screamed in terror and they got to the car, but Pumpkin-Man laughed with his black Jack-o-lantern mouth.  ""Happy All Hallows Eve"" the monster wished them, jamming the sickle into the one's forehead in the darkness.  Screaming, the last girl got the sickle buried into her throat in the shadows.  

Forty minutes later, a cop came out of the home and gave a baby to a young couple.  ""I rescued your baby folks.  These girls were the kidnappers.  Very strange and scary on Halloween to find that all six of them have been murdered!"" he informed them.  In the living-room-window, were six human-skulls, all glowing-yellow inside them like Jack-o-lanterns.  The raspy-laugh of the monster known as Pumpkin-Man was heard then, as he stood waving in the backyard, without his hood on and his robe and collar was now dark-blue like his hands.  "

We stayed there for a bit until the bombs dropped, sending everything into oblivion. I’m very good at lucid dreaming because I practiced every single night and I got to the point where I could do it whenever I wanted. I practiced lucid dreaming so much, that it eventually became second nature and even if I didn’t want to, my body would still try to lucid dream as best as it could. 


But when we entered those chambers, something came over me. It was my muscle memory, attempting to lucid dream. As I felt the cold temperature of the chamber glass close over me, I didn’t realize it, but I was trying to lucid dream. I tried to imagine an object in my mind while I was going to sleep, I tried to pinch myself so that I could remember to pinch myself when I was inside my dream, which would cause me to wake up. I was dreaming, and I realized it. At first I thought it was fine, I saw in the movies how cryogenic sleep worked. They would go in the little chamber then wake up almost instantly. But it wasn’t like that. 10 minutes passed. Nothing. 30 minutes passed. Absolutely nothing. The amount of panic I felt during those 30 minutes were unexplainable. I can’t express with words how scared I really was at the time. At the first year I was still trying desperately to wake up, but eventually I just got over it. Now at the 150 year mark, I’ve completely given up. 


I just want help. Over these past hundred years of dreaming, I’ve found out that there are worse things awaiting man than death. I’ve found out that life can sometimes be scarier than death itself.

An external light blinked on and the door was answered.

“Happy Halloween” they shouted in unison.

“Oh look at you two, nearly scared me half to death you did” The elderly woman who’d answered said in mock surprise.  “Just a sec, I’ll see what I’ve got left.  I thought everyone had been already”

Looking at the visitors she noticed them shivering visibly, the temperature outside having plunged in the last few days.

“Come inside for a sec while I look for something nice.  Do you like toffee sweetheart?” she asked the child.

The visitors walked into the house, closing the door behind them.

“Thanks you so much, it’s absolutely freezing out there.”  The woman’s voice sounded ecstatic behind the cheap werewolf mask she was wearing.

The elderly woman appeared again carrying a small bag of wrapped toffees.

“Here you go sweet, help yourself to some of these” 

As she offered the bag to the child, it fell to the floor and began to moan loudly.  The woman threw the bag on to a small table and looked in concern at the woman.

“Oh dear, is she okay, has she eaten too much candy already?”

The child began to thrash about on the floor, the moans morphing into inhuman wails.  
Each moan accompanied by a crunching sound that the elderly woman couldn’t identify.  She reached for the phone.

“Leave it” the woman shouted.  She’ll be okay in a minute, she just has to adjust”

The elderly woman looked confused

“Adjust, what do you mean adjust?”

She looked down at the child and screamed loudly.  What had once been a child was now no more.  In its place a long limbed monstrosity that attempted to climb to its feet.  The old woman fell back into a sitting position on the bottom step of the stairs.  The creature eventually staggered to its feet, a hybrid abomination looking part human and part insect, swaying gradually from side to side as if getting used to its feet.  The mother walked over to where the older woman now sat and knelt down beside her.  Leaning in, she whispered into her ear

“I’m sorry it has to be this way, she is so very hungry, and hasn’t eaten in months.  I will ask her to make it quick.  After all, you *did* invite us in”

Is it the fear of the unknown or something more sinister, something instinctual engraved into our heads from birth. As our early ancestors fought for light to protect themselves from what lurks just beyond the glow.

Are we hiding from beast even though we haven't been hunted for thousands of years, or is that we still know that there is something that still waits for us to turn off the lights and fall asleep, waiting in that dark corner or in your closet just beyond view. That place you always look when you wake in the middle of the night. You do your best to convince yourself that there is nothing there but your instincts tell you otherwise. 

Will you turn on the light to see what still lurks in the night or will you convince yourself to go back to sleep and pray that your instincts are wrong. "

When you're kids it's the night you get to be your favourite superhero and you're actually encouraged to take candy from strangers.

As you get a little older, it's the night when everyone's inhibitions are a little lower and people dress a touch less, shall we say, 'conservatively', than usual.

Even adults can still be part of the fun. You get to make some kid's night by telling them how great their costume is when they come to your door, seeing their face light up under the grease paint when you give them an extra chocolate for being so 'scary'.

I love going out on Halloween, seeing everyone enjoying the festivities in their own way. To see them embracing all things spooky.

It's the night when no one bats an eye at a bloodied corpse lurching down the street, or pale skinned monsters shrieking in the night. It's the one day of the year when people don't panic when a cackling, wrinkled hag fixes them with a cloudy eyed stare.

It's that special time when you let yourselves see me lurking in the shadows and congratulate the hunched, rasping figure, who's face must surely be a mask, on my great costume.

It's been so long since you really believed we were there. This is the one night we all get to be who we really are.

When November begins, real life starts again, the monsters, ghouls and ghosts packed away to gather dust for another year. 

We go back to being the whispers you hear in the silence, the shadows that seem to move when you turn off the lights, the memory of a nightmare that fades away each morning.

But at the end of October each and every year, for just one night, you're ready to see us. We almost get to be real again. 

Sometimes, if the stars are right and the moon is full, and you wander away from the lights, we can even reach out and touch you. "

I really like it when there is a little crack in the curtains. I know its an unpopular opinion, but it makes me more comfortable being able to see through the gap, and into the unknown. It is even better at Halloween. The candles inside the pumpkins light up the room, casting shadows across the wall. The candlelights flicker and the shadows dance their Halloween jig.

I stood up and walked to the window. I opened it slightly and let the cool breeze of the autumn night wash over me, as I looked up towards the moon. I froze. I felt like somebody was watching me. I held my breath and slowly turned around. There was nothing there. I smiled and turned back to the window. I almost laughed at myself jumping at shadows. Then I climbed through the window, my fangs bared, as I crossed the room towards the bed in the corner.

I'd stick my hands in a bowl of water and all the other kids would laugh because my hands wouldn't get wet. I couldn't explain it and neither could my parents or doctors but it wasn't life threatening either. My mother used to always call it my ""personal gift"" and that grandma was the same way. I always thought that was a shame because my grandma had died shortly after my mother was born in their house. 

Years would pass but the amusement of ""washing"" my hands never did.  The water would just glide past and my hands would remain as dry as dry could be. 

When I turned 28, I started getting nightmares. 

Hands grasping for me from an impossibly deep body of water alongside the sensation of being held down. 

In those moments of terror I remember caring for my mother in her final days and the way she held my hands as if they were a family heirloom. 

When I do, the hands go limp and the water around them opens up like it would with my own. 

So I thought my hands were the cause - and at some point I was numbed to the idea of cutting them off. 

And I did just that.

In every surviving picture of my grandmother, she wore gloves and for the longest time I didn't know why.

It was ruled by an Emperor and and an Empress, the twin monarchs of a great and prosperous land. When one slept, the other ruled the land fairly and with great concern for the people. And so they became known as Emperor Moon and Empress Sun, for one would always be watching over their kingdom, that was as sure as the sun and moon in the sky. 

In a particularly hot summer, which burned the fields and clutched the land in a terrible drought, a man came to the twin emperors palace, dressed in strange and arcane garments with darkened skin and a peculiar accent. He introduced himself as Nyarlathotep, a travelling pharao from the distant land of egypt. 

They invited the stranger inside and greeted him with many prized gifts. 
But the pharaoh simply demanded a meeting with the twin emperors. Their discussion was held behind closed gates and, after they had brought tea and many exotic dishes, not even the servants were let in.
The audience lasted one full day and night, after which only the pharaoh emerged from the chamber. 

Following the strange king's visit the emperors became more and more reclusive.The throne rooms were sealed off. Only the most loyal servants and advisors were let in by the royal guard, and after a while even they were strictly kept out.

The king and queen were seen no more by the volk, the nobility or the servants and without their rule the kingdom slowly fell to ruin. Crime and chaos became common, theft and murder an everyday occurrence.

With these dark times a strange silence did decend upon the once prosperous kingdom, the skies were clouded with storms that blocked any and all sunlight. Crops on the fields fell rotting and dead, famine and disease ravaged the population. But, throughout all this hardship, all the death and misery, the people seemed to only grow closer to their beloved monarchs. In every house, and be it a ruin, there stood an altar to those they worshipped as gods, every farmer, every housewife, every starving child, even every last bandit, thief and other scum bowed and kneeled to the long gone king and queen. The desperate prayers all headed towards the now empty palace, through the spacious halls, that once held great feasts and festivals, they went, through the winding corridors, once patrolled by the royal guard, they flew, all headed towards that long sealed chamber.

Then, after centuries past, the population only kept alive by their perverse obsession, a sound echoed through the halls of the palace. 
The grinding, creaking noise of dragging, golden metal on the cold marble floor. The sound of an age-old gate to a long-sealed hall opening.

And from that opening there spewed a terrible black fog, a smoke as dark as the sky on a moonless night. The fog filled every last corner of the palace from the corridor to the halls, until not the highest towers could pierce it.

From that mist-filled chamber emerged an appendage, a thing that seemed to have once been a hand, now twisted and warped into what resembled the wing of a gigantic bat more than anything. 
What followed the hand-wing was a thing of such utter repulsiveness, such stupendous terror that words will hardly do it the justice it does not deserve.

What followed was the horned head of a hellish beast. The skull was warped into
a form so grotesque it seemed to almost resemble a crescent moon. 
The eldritch face had no mouth, instead only slits where the maw should have been. And from those slits, like toxic filth from behind a gutter, poured that black, blinding smoke.

Following close behind the first one, a second head emerged, even more horrid than the first. 
The face was just as twisted and repulsive, even though it seemed rounder with long sharp teeth protruding from the upper jaw. 

As the creature took another step out of the darkness, it's was revealed in it's entire, terrifying glory.
The garments that mercifully covered most of it's body, had a certain resemblance to those the emperor and empress were dressed in, decades ago when they last saw the light of day.

Because, as absurd and blasphemous this may sound, this dragon-like abomination that had just taken its first step back into it's former kingdom, was the Emperor Moon and Empress Sun. 

The reason for this ungodly transformation may only the cosmos and the dark gods that dwell within it know. Was it the malicious curse of the pharaoh, that warped and twisted their body's into one, tortured being? Were it the centuries of isolation from their beloved kingdom, that erased every last shred of sanity and humanity from their existence? Or, perhaps, is the reason still hidden in that cursed chamber, somewhere in the infernal darkness which only the void between stars could rival?"

You’re dreaming a regular dream, and something happens at an oddly precise moment. The same moment you wake up in the real world.

&nbsp;

It could be something falling to the ground and causing a loud noise, for instance. Shortly before this, a large suspended object appears in your dream. It hangs in there for several seconds before dropping, perfectly synchronized with whatever caused the real sound. Or it could be, say, your wife touching your arm. Just before her hand reaches your skin, someone in dreamland comes out of nowhere and touches you too. Or maybe it could be your brother throwing a glass of water in your face. In the dream, you're walking by the beach when a huge wave rises and you can see it coming, getting closer, closer, until it hits you. Just as the water hits your face in real life. It could be a reaction, but how come the dream knows about it in advance? The wave took so long to reach you.

&nbsp;

You had no way to know the water was coming. And you had no way to know your wife's hand was about to touch you either. Or that something would cause a noise in the adjacent room. But your brain knows. A huge part of the population claims to have experienced this, and they agree the feeling is not a reaction. Nobody knows why though, no study ever found an explanation. Somehow, your brain knows something you don't, and he keeps it hidden from you.

&nbsp;

But other times, it happens in a different way. You get one of these feelings, but there's nothing there. You feel a touch that wakes you up, or something pulling you down, trying to make you fall. However, when you wake up, you're alone.

&nbsp;

Yeah, but... your brain knows something you don't. He sees something you don't.

&nbsp;

When this happens again, when you wake up in the middle of the night with the feeling of hearing a noise, or having being touched or pulled down, think about this.

The once grinning face, freshly carved as of only last night, was now smeared on the payment in a demented frown.  Damn neighborhood punks, she thought.  This was the reason they couldn’t have nice things.


Across the street her elderly neighbor Irma was standing in front of a similar scene.  Except not just one had been smashed, but all three of the carefully carved pumpkins that Irma had placed on her stoop the night before.  Elena walked across the street to help her clean up.


“Kids, huh?” Elena tried to muse, as she scraped the orange good off the sidewalk.


“They should be more careful,” Irma said in her thick Lithuania accent. “This is not good way to make friend.”


Elena chuckled.  “I know what you mean.  Hey, I’m going to grab another one to put out for trick or treaters at the store today.  Can I pick you one up too?”


Irma’s face brightened.  “Oh yes.  Thank you Elena.  You are so good to me.”


Later that day, as promised, Elena dropped a new pumpkin off at Irma’s house, and was surprised to learn that the older woman planned to carve it and put it out that same night.  “Don’t worry, dear.  This pumpkin is special.  Its candlelight will make bright the neighborhood.  It is a blessing for all who respect it.”  


And with that, a plate of poppy seed cookies was thrust into Elena’s hands and she was shooed out the door.


Sure enough, Irma carved her pumpkin and set it on her stoop.  Elena could see its candlelight flickering from her bedroom window when she retired for the night.   


It wasn’t until the middle of the night, somewhere between dreams and awake, that she heard laughter from the street.  Curious, she rose from her bed and went to her window.  She peered out just in time to see a teenager heaving Irma’s pumpkin over his head and throwing it to the ground while a few others laughed around him.  “You little shits,” she muttered.


She turned around and went back to her bedside table.  Just as she was punching numbers into her phone the shrill screech of tires sounded along with screams, and she ran to her window.


Other neighbor’s lights were coming on and doors were opening.  A car was stopped in the middle of the road, its hood dented in and smoking.  Just in front of the car, the teenager who smashed the pumpkin lay twitching.  His head wasn’t even a head.  It was just red, broken smear in the road.  Brains and skull, gore and blood were heaped disorganized pile.


Irma had come out on her stoop to see all the hubbub and the two women made eye contact.  And for a moment, just a moment, Elena swore she saw Irma wink.

The house was enormous and Gina's words floated through his head: 'Plenty of rooms to disappear for a bit.'  He thought of the wink she'd given him and sweat began to pool on his forehead.  He prayed it wouldn't leave streaks in his makeup - Helen had spent more than an hour on it, her perfectionist nature forcing her to make his skin seem as dead-like as possible despite her disapproval.  'Who tries to get laid on Halloween,' she'd muttered, her pencil pressing lightly into Dale's cheek.  'We've been planning to check out the foundry for months and you're ditching us.'

Dale sighed.  Gina was a year older and a good ten leagues hotter than Dale, at least according to Warren.  'Hel, it's *Gina.*  When an opportunity like this pops up I have to grab it.' 

'I don't get it, Dale.  She just looks... *fake.'* She held up her pencil for emphasis. 'And I would know.'  

The door opened with a creak and Dale found himself staring into the bosom of a stunning woman.  ""You must be Dale,"" she said with a smile, clasping her hands together as the high-schooler raised his eyes to meet hers.  The family resemblance was clear and Dale felt his mouth run dry at the sight of Gina twenty years down the line.  ""Come in, come in!  Gina's told me so much about you.""

Gina's mother led him down the hallway, her hips swaying in time with Dale's heartbeat.  It thundered in his ears twisting his excitement into something... spookier.  ""She has?""

""Of course!"" she said, gesturing to the dining room entrance where Gina sat primly between two women, an open seat across from her between two more.  She eyed him dreamily and he felt his heart speed up yet again.  ""Gina tells me about all her crushes.""  Dale melted as Gina's mother winked at him and took her place at the head of the table, gesturing toward the open seat across from Gina.  As he sat he smiled awkwardly, suddenly conscious of six smoldering gazes resting on him and his $19.99 vampire outfit - the only costume in the room.  Gina's mother handled the introductions, naming each of Gina's aunt's in turn.  Dale kept his chin up and his eyes away from the ample cleavage surrounding him, black silk sharpening the pale skin beside and beneath.  Instead of asking Gina 'what happened to Netflix and chill' he simply an eyebrow, but she simply replied with a wider smile - the same unnatural grin her aunts' shared.

""So you guys don't do masks,"" Dale asked, his voice dry.  ""Do you?""

The excitement in Dale's chest bloomed into sudden panic as the smiles stretched, stretched until lips tore and bled then stretched further.  ""Oh honey,"" Gina's mother whispered as one by one, the aunts' faces sloughed off and dropped into the empty soup bowls beneath them.  

""On Halloween we take our masks *off*."""

I was making my way home when I heard somebody start following me. It was dark, so I couldn't actually see if anyone was following me. I couldn't hear any breaths so I had no way of actually knowing. Eventually, my paranoia kicked in and I got really nervous. I kept looking behind me, but I still felt a presence. I was really starting to freak out at around 9pm. I was roughly five minutes away from home so I jogged. Whatever was behind me started running after me too. At home, it seemed to stop. I couldn't hear it walking after me anymore, so I went to bed. When I woke up, I had kind of forgotten about it. I got ready to go to work. When I was walking outside, I heard someone behind me. Not too strange, lots of people went to their car in the morning. But it followed me all the way to my car. Suddenly, something clicked in my head and I remembered what had happened. Something has followed me."

Linda looked around, trying to recognize one of the faces in the crowd, but everyone either wore a mask or thick facepaint, completely obscuring their identity. The werewolf lady dancing next to her could just as well be her mother - Linda wouldn't know.

At exactly ten pm, the blaring music came to a sudden stop. So did the dancing, laughing and shrieking. Everyone had fallen silent. The crowd parted, making way for a man with large red horns on his head. His cloak made him look like a giant as he stepped onto the stage. His voice filled the hall as he shouted:

""We'en, exaudi nos!""

The crowd began chanting. Confused and unsettled, Linda tried to immitate the sounds coming from their throats. The man dropped his cloak, revealing a strange-looking robe. He reached into his pocket to produce a shiny dagger which he slowly rose to his neck. One swift motion and flood spurted out of the open wound.
Linda turned away in disgust. But she had been warned. The annual sacrifices were always a bit gorey.

Leaving my motel room
I was running late
Asked some old guy for directions
Back to the interstate 

Go straight for about a mile
There's a dirt road on your right
That'll save you lots of time
Said, thank you and goodbye

I'm driving down some backroad
Fog is rolling thick
In the middle of nowhere
Trying to get there quick

Don't know where I'm going
Or where I'm at right now
See shadows moving in the fog
Hear the coyotes howl

Never should have listened 
To what that old man had to say
There was something off about him
That look upon his face

Shoulda kept these wheels rolling
Shoulda never made that turn
Just lost the dashboard lights
Can smell the wires burn

The engine light is flashing
Losing power quick
Headlights fade to nothing
Engine dies, that's it

Now in total darkness 
Hear chanting in the woods
I don't know just what it is
But I know it can't be good

Chants are getting louder
Feet don't fail me now
Something hits me in the head
And knocks me to the ground

Lightning bolts crashing
Hear the thunder roar
Now I'm surrounded
By twenty men or more

In a circle all around me
In black robes and capes
As one kneels down over me
I see the old mans face

One eye glazed over
That scar upon his cheek
Puts his hand over my eyes
And tells me go to sleep

I awake in sweat
In this beat up motel room
It must have been a dream
Or so I will assume

Deja vu just hit me
I been here before
One thing is for certain
I won't be here anymore

Grab my stuff, I'm outta here
That was far too real
Throw it all in the car
Hit the gas and turn the wheel 

Saw that same old man 
At that turn as I was passing
He seemed to look right through me
Then he started laughing
 
That'll be two years ago
In about a week
Today, I swear I passed
That same old man on the street 

Same eye glazed over
Same scar upon his cheek
Swear I heard him whisper
I’ll see you in your dreams

Turned around to look
He was gone with the wind
Was he really there
Or am I dreaming again

Parents every year are petrified of their loved ones going missing, to be that one missing child on Halloween..

&#x200B;

*Dont let it be mine they pray*

&#x200B;

Decorations line my pathway from street to front door... Jack 'o' Lanterns, skeletons peek behind plastic gravestones, Goblin figures strewn across the lawn, a speaker playing the faint sound of a wolf howling and terrible winds blowing.. beckoning every child in the neighbourhood, *this* is the house to visit on Halloween.

&#x200B;

And you know what? It is. I have a giant bowl full of sugary sweets on my porch, a welcoming smile for all who knock and polite conversation for the parents who escort the little ones door to door ensuring in this day and age the night stays as innocent as intended.

*but....*

&#x200B;

Some parents *dont* go door to door with their little ones, some think safety in numbers and send them with their friends off out into the night.

&#x200B;

""***Trick or treeeeat""*** The children gleefully chime in unison as i open the door, casting my eyes to the end of my driveway, no parents in sight.

&#x200B;

""***Wow, those are some scary costumes!***"" I theatrically exclaim, hands in the air to a round of laughter from the younger children in the group. ""***So who do we have here? I can see a zombie Darth Vader, a Cowboy, you two must be those sisters from that Disney film, Freezing***"" More laughter from the children ***""You must be werewolf..very scary! And you must be...forgive me but who are you meant to be young man?****"" kneeling before the children looking puzzled ""****Ah yes! You are the Count himself, I'm so sorry Mr Dracula!****"" With a smile i raise to my feet again.*

&#x200B;

""***I was going to say Trick to make you earn these sweets but as you all look so fantastic..would you like to choose from my private selection of sweets and collectibles? Only the best costumes in the area get to choose and this year i think all of you make the grade, what do you say? wanna see?***"" I take a step back, beckoning them in...excitedly they follow..they always do.

&#x200B;

Leading them through the well lit hallway we come to the end, a simple unassuming red door with a 'Bill's Kitchen' sign above it and a long metal bar across the middle instead of a handle. ""***Just through there kiddies, I need to close the front door, go ahead, the light switch is to the left***"" As they enter i turn back to them and close the red door.

&#x200B;

Opening the slat in the door i peer in at the children as they begin to look bewildered, the younger ones start to cry..""***Biiill...Dinners here...Kids...you might want to not pet Bill, he's not too friendly..***""  **Out of the shadow's Bill appears...A hulking mass of a dog..**

Everyone knew the rules: There was a pistol inside a glass cupula in the middle of the room which should be taken before the time limit of 5 minutes. It only had one bullet loaded so it had to count. No room for mistakes there.

Immediately after the signal had been given from the speakers above, they desperately ran towards the gun.

After a few minutes of struggle, the taller guy had the advantage when he managed to land a punch that sent the smaller guy towards the ground, shakily. That was, until the moment he opened the cupula. A jet of pepper-like gas erupted from tiny holes around the glass that none of them had time to check out. 

The taller young man covered his eyes screaming in agony while his face quickly went reddish.

Not wanting to miss this opportunity, the smaller one leapt and grabbed the gun, pointing firmly to the taller man while slowly retreating back.

-No! Don't do this! Please man... - The taller man begged, while still scrubbing his eyes.

-W-why not?! - Asked the smaller one, visibly shaking.

-Because I'm your best friend! I always helped you when you needed, remember? It has been like that forever...

-Y-You're making this harder...! You know I don't want to do this either... But... - Replied the smaller one, now crying.

-You can't! You will regret this, I'm sure! Let me h... - Warned the taller guy, advancing desperately.

-NO! I'm sorry dude... But I will not let you have your way... not this time!

Shortly, a gun shot was heard. Then a red light alarm indicating the time was over echoed within the place.

The heavy wheezing metal sound started and the ground slowly dragged the now wailing and desperate smaller guy and his best friend's corpse towards the giant spinning meat grinders on the sides.

The audience of the richest men and women in the world, sitting on their confortable chairs, laughed and thrilled. 

That night was promising, indeed."

A few days after that it moved sort of crawled up my spine to my neck, you have no idea how hard it is to sleep when it hurts every time you shift a little bit, but this time I again dealt with it just finding a few pain killers.

And then things were fine it just stopped hurting I decided whatever it was had passed and got back into the spirit of dull work life, but when I got home and tried to sleep something kept bothering my head, I don't know what it is, can't see it either, but I have phantom horns or something maybe antennae.

I sat in the middle of the darkened room, knees against my chest and arms around my knees. I was shaking, spit foaming at my mouth as my eyes desperately searched around the hellish enclosure for some sort of light, some sort of sign that I wasn't alone. As always, I got nothing. Tap, tap tap tap. Tap. 

Maybe I was blind at this point, I couldn't tell. I couldn't feel anything other than cool stone walls and floors, and the harsh, torn fabric of the clothes I wore. The only thing I could smell was metal. The only thing I could taste was blood. I could hear everything. 

I wasn't even chained. They didn't bother. I had free roam of the place, but I had no center of gravity. I tripped when I attempted to stand, and as a result I now had gashes in my head from doing so. 

It could've been a year ago I last saw light. Maybe three. Maybe ten. I lost track of time. 

Tap, tap tap tap. 

I swiveled my head from side to side, frantically trying to find the source of the sound. Nothing. 

Clicking erupted from inside my enclosure, causing me to scoot backwards in fear. I toppled over and fell onto my back. Tiny claws scratched at my face, and I screamed. 

""Oh, don't scream! Hush, we're taking care of you..."" A disembodied voice echoed. Silence, and the scratches stopped. Tears were running down my face at this point, my eyes clenched shut as I hoped the nightmare would end. Tap, tap tap. 

A rough, cold fabric was pushed over my head and clouded my judgement even more. Sounds were more muffled now, my breathing echoing back to me was the only thing I could hear with clarity. I tried to ask what they were, and what they were doing with me, but my voice only came out in rasps. I was trapped, now. Utterly and completely trapped. 

I was uprooted from my spot on the metal slab that used to be my home for what seemed like years. Dragged along the ground like a sack of flour that they could not carry properly. Tap, tap tap. 

More clicking. I felt something claw at my eyes and i turned my head side-to-side in quick succession, attempting to get rid of whatever was on my face. 

Fear overtook me and I blacked out. 

When I came to, I was still moving. Except now, I could see around me and could hear quite clearly. I bent over and stopped our small group of 5 for a quick moment. I reached into my bag and picked up another rat and placed it on our victim's face.

9s85nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9s85nv/shortsighted/,Short-sighted,20,1,1540771465.0,"I had been short-sighted, in more than one sense.

First, in the obvious sense that an ophthalmologist had diagnosed me. Anything farther than ten feet away was a dull featureless blur – like watching the world through cellophane. I could see up close just fine, but my brain ran like a Nintendo 64 – anything past a certain distance just wouldn't render with any discernible detail.

But I'd also been short-sighted packing my duffel bag. I packed contact lenses, sure. But they'd expired two weeks ago. The label also told me that wearing expired contact lenses could invite bacteria, fungi, and amoebae into my eyes, resulting in infection and possibly blindness. 

And now was not a good time to go blind.

Lately, our numbers had been dwindling. Despite daily warnings over the radio, telling us to remain in our quarantine zones, behind electric fences and barbed wire for our own protection, we'd grown restless.

“I never seen none of them,” Mr. Pepperman explained, as he pushed past the barricades this morning. “Not for weeks. If there ever was an outbreak, it's sure as hell over by now.”

The guards didn't try to stop him.

He was probably right, of course. There hadn't been a real outbreak in years, and never around here.

The response team just liked to be thorough. In the meantime, our houses were probably being ransacked by looters.

I'd been itching to leave too. But, due mostly to my myopia, I elected to stay. 

I passed the time by reading. One of the things I learned recently, from an old rain-soaked Outbreak Preparations Guide, was about the Tueller Drill. 

Tueller, a Salt Lake City police sergeant, determined that a gun-toting policeman can only successfully defend himself from an infected individual if he is at least 20 feet away. Otherwise, there is not enough time to unholster, draw, aim, and fire before you get bitten.

I had Tueller in mind tonight. When the sirens began to blare, red lights circling the quarantine camp, alerting us to a breach in the fenceline, I picked up the snub-nosed revolver I kept in my duffel bag, and trained it on the first blurry shape in the dark. 

I could hear nothing over the sirens. I could see nothing farther than ten feet away. I couldn't even tell if the shape was facing my direction.

Some in the camps had begun to question whether there were any real outbreaks at all. Whether the government didn't just use them as a means to covertly cull undesirables. Move all the good citizens, all the food, into the safety of the camps, and leave the political dissidents and religious minorities to starve. When they eventually attacked the camps out of hunger, have the guards put them down.

I didn't know what to believe.

But, in that instant, staring down the barrel at an unknown shape in the dark, I had to decide. 

And I decided to fire."

I had always had a fear of the wilderness so I wasn't thrilled when he asked me to go, but I complied anyway.

Later that week it was time to leave for the campsite, I packed my belongings and strolled over to Williams house and his Dad drove us out to the camp. By the time we had arrived, it was nearing midnight so there wasn't much to do except unpack our things, set up the tent and call it a night. It must have been about 3 hours later I was awoken by what I believe to be a snarling noise that was coming from the right of me, right behind 3 large trees. I got immediately frightened and slowly unzipped the tent that William and I were sleeping in. I peered to the right to see a large goat-like figure standing on two hooves illuminated by the moonlight. It had large eyes with a devilishly red tint to them, it glared at me for a second then sprawled backward and started bolting into the forest, I eventually lost sight of it. I let out a scream and woke up William and his father, by my scream they immediately knew that something was wrong. I screamed ""We Need To Go"", as I said this we all jumped out of our tents and ran to the car park and got into our car. As we sped out of the resort I explained to them what I had seen and they were both in awe. We eventually got home and tried to get some sleep, but I didn't sleep a wink.

There's always been a few who've chased after me, but if I'm being honest I don't think I've ever given them what they really needed. 

To be clear, I'm not fishing for sympathy. I used to find it tough to deal with when I was younger, seeing so many people choose someone else over me. It's easy to get bitter at that age. 

But as you get older you get a better sense of perspective. You learn to see things from other people's point of view. 

I don't blame people for making the decisions they do. Everyone wants to think that they can have it all - that the guy who promises to be their Prince Charming really means it when he says that he'll take them away from all this. That he'll make all their dreams come true. 

I still feel bad for the ones who get seduced though. The ones who get taken in by someone promising them the world, who say that they'll be together forever, if only you'll be theirs. 

I'd laugh at the ones who promise a sex life you could only dream of if I hadn't seen what they make people do to get it. The awful things they do, just to feel worthy. Turning their backs on their morals, all to become what the 'one who really loves them' wants them to be. 

So many of them end up a shadow of what they could have been, wasting their best years on someone who promises everything. But 'everything' never seems to come. Those guys are only ever after one thing - everything that makes you who you are. And once it's given, you can't get it back. 

I can't promise much. I can't promise happiness. Certainly not a perfect future. Truth is, I don't know what things will be like if you choose me. 

But I promise I won't come with judgement or condemnation. I promise I won't punish you for every mistake you think you made, suffer for every sin. 

I won't make you thank me every day for being with you. I won't care who else you've loved before. 

I promise that I'll be there when you need me. When the pain is too great, when the shell you wear fails, when the world falls away. 

I promise I'll come when fate calls me, and not when the prophet or the carpenter, or anyone else, says it's time. 

I know we won't be together long, but while we are, I'll be with you every step. You'll go on without me, and I won't try to hold you back. 

I know I'm not the guy of your dreams. But please believe me when I say that I care. The reaper always cares for the harvest. 

And I promise, when it's time, I'll take you by the hand. "

The police arrived at our house at about 5:00 in the morning and said they'd found him. The cop was a nice guy who did his best to break the news gently. At least he tried. The rest of the morning was a blur. I remember grandma and grandpa holding my mom, crying quietly and talking about God and stuff. My dad sat on the stairs and stared out the window with a blank face.

They gave us a few days before telling us the circumstances. Some morning shifter found his body next to a dumpster behind a strip mall. His arm was broken and there was a knife in his head. Nobody showed us pictures, but he was the first one in my family to have a closed casket funeral. The knife, of course, went to an evidence locker. Almost everything else was thrown away. But they gave us his watch. My brother had a red novelty wristwatch that my dad got him when he was five. Even as a teenager, he wore it everywhere but the shower. My mom tells me he used to parade around at family parties, asking everyone if they knew what time it was and making a show about announcing that it was half past six.

When I went back to school, the teachers gave me a bunch of cards that they'd asked the other kids to make. Everyone was nice to me for a while. Apart from a couple hours a week with the counselor, things started out pretty routine. I don't really remember what the other kids were like before that, but that week, they were really nice. People I barely knew would sit and have lunch with me. They picked me first in gym and let me read out loud in class. But they got bored of that. A month later, they just treated me like anyone else.

Then the whispers started. They always got quiet when they saw me, saying hi like they always did, but with nervous looks on their faces. First they said my dad did it, then my mom, then my grandma. The story changed too as time went on. Sometimes my brother was a drug dealer. Sometimes we moved here from out of state after a mysterious tragedy in the news. Most of them were incoherent, all of them contradictory, but that didn't stop anyone from talking. I even heard some of the teachers doing it. I did my best not to listen. Even when they started hitting me and running away. Even when someone put a firecracker in our mailbox, I didn't react. Even when they locked me in the bathroom and banged on the doors.

Until, one day, Rebecca McDowell came to school with a red wristwatch.

So I killed her too."

A sharp prick in my arm. I struggle against the restraints. It does not budge.

“Be still, Mr Jones,” The doctor tightened the strap on me. He found my vein with ease and pushed a second needle into me.

***“I’ll choose… treat. These are wonderful costumes, young men and women,” the old man smiled and his eyes smiled with him. He dropped one full-sized chocolate bar into the Witch’s pillowcase, one into Iron Man’s backpack, one into Vampire’s basket. He turned to me and placed a small Mars bar into my hands. “Sorry, I ran out of those,” he spoke apologetically.***

“…which will be administered last. Do you understand, Convict?” a warden speaks.

“Sure,” I reply, even though I am not paying attention. The heart monitor beeps ominously. “We will now raise the curtain.” The warden announces.

“Wait.” I interrupted. “Five minutes,” the warden sighed.

***“This isn’t fair!” I snarled. My fingers twitched. The pocket knife in my pocket called out to me. “Hey, young man, it is still pretty early. I am sure there will be other treats along the way,” the old man squeezed my shoulder.***

***“Did you take your medicine today, Harry?” The Vampire took off her mask, and my sister stared back at me. “Mom says you need to take a deep breath.”***

***“SHUT UP!” I exploded. “All of you are so mean to me all the time!”***

***“Harry, rela-“***

***I reached for my pocket.***

“Your time is up.”

A whirring sound started somewhere in the room. I watch the curtains part, revealing a room of audiences, who watch on mournfully.

“For the murder of Jenny Jones, Ethan Jones, Dylan Pollock and Sir Kevin Pelton, the Convict has been sentenced to death.” I tune it out again.

***A bloodied Witch. A mangled Iron Man. A disfigured Vampire. The old man looked like minced meat.***

***I stabbed, I stabbed and I stabbed. The blood kept spilling until I saw red and blue lights arrive and I felt a body tackle me. I fall face-down into the ground. “He’s only a kid,” I heard a shocked voice. “But he’s a monster,” another one trembled.***

“May god bless you.” The priest closes his bible. He looks at me silently.

I feel a calming anaesthetic flow into me. Murmurs start in the audience and I even hear a cry. As the too-white room dissolves into darkness, the lifeless bodies of Halloween start to appear in front of me.

It brought a smile to my face."

9ry8ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9ry8ly/dear_diary/,Dear Diary,360,32,1540678404.0,"Dear Diary,

I love my husband. He's the only thing I love at this point. We have had a wonderful five years together, through sickness and through health. He had a cancer scare back when we were engaged, but he fought it off. I like to think it was some sort of power that love gave him. 

He's the best thing to ever happen to me, my Mark. Chocolate hair and gorgeous green emerald eyes. Tanned skin and a lovely build. All mine, for seven years in total. 

Mark is always asking me why I did it. I tell him I married him because he's my soulmate, my ""one"". He always seems satisfied with this answer. 

Our neighbors used to ask us about our little girl. Eventually, they stopped asking when I told them that she was put up for adoption. 

I love my Mark. When he asks why, I tell him the same thing over and over again. Lately, he's been depressed. I'm worried about his health. 

His attention has always been on me. Of course, there were small hiccups, especially when our daughter was born. I took care of the hiccups. I made him drop out of school, and I promised him I would pay for the house and everything else. I'm a doctor, so of course I got a pretty good salary. He seemed okay with this reply. He always seems okay with everything I do. Another reason, among many, why I love my Mark. 

When the police came to our house, his attention was divided and he was anxious around them. I quickly got rid of them by calling her grandmother and having her confirm that she was okay. They seemed okay with her confirmation.

I thought deceiving policemen would be easier, as they're trained to spot liars. Diary, as you will remember, my grandmother died when I was fifteen-years old from a heart-attack. Of course, they didn't realize that. 

My husband is the best thing to ever happen to me. You see, when I was visiting her at the cemetery this morning, I didn't allow Mark to join me. When we have sex tonight, I don't want him to look at me in disgust and become more depressed than he already is. I want him to be able to perform as he should. With a condom, of course. No more hiccups. 

You see, I had to do it. He is my husband, mine and mine only. Mark is the only thing I love, and his attention must be on me and on me alone. He loves me, so his attention must be on me anyway. She was a distraction that was not welcome in our love live. 

Mark is mine, and he is only allowed to love me. Through sickness and through health, we will be together. He is mine and mine alone. 

Goodnight, Diary. Mark has come home. It's time. "

The neighbor kids will sneak around the cemetery and pretend to be ghosts to prank my siblings and I. 

That or the place will flood when an autumn thunderstorm rolls in. 

Last night the weather proved I was right about the latter. 

So when my little brother Joey told me that there was a strange tall man standing out there staring at the house, I thought nothing of it. 
No one would be out in that storm. 

He came again about half an hour later to pester me so I got up to take a look. 

Sure enough, I saw a pale man, almost albino standing in mud that went up to his ankles. It looked like he was wearing an outfit for the KKK with a blank chrome mask on. 

“Hey! Hey you!! Get out of here before I call the cops!!” I yelled. 

The man just stood there, not saying a word. 

“Is he a ghost?” Joey asked. 

“He’s going to come get us!” Catherine squeaked. 

“There’s no such thing as ghosts,” I chided them both. 

“Get in your rooms,” I added. 

I tried to call the police, but the storm made reception too spotty. 
There was no indication the call even went through. 
All the while the man in the faceless mask didn’t move a muscle. 

I grabbed a flashlight and my dad’s service pistol from the safe (he had told me only to use it in an emergency if he wasn’t home) and mustered up as much bravery as I could to go confront our intruder. 

In the dim evening light I waved toward the man and tried to scare him away without getting too close. All he did was continue to stare upward toward the second floor window where Joey and Cath were hiding. 

“This is your last warning!!” I screamed. 

His quiet behavior only struck me as more bizarre. 

Was he in fact a spirit?

I raised dad’s gun above my head and fired a warning shot. 

The man looked at me briefly unfazed and then turned and walked away into the shadows. 

A wave of relief fell over my body as I returned to the house. 

I went upstairs to tell Joey and Cath the good news. 

Instead I was greeted by an empty room. Furniture, clothing and toys were strewn about showing signs of a struggle. 

I ran through the house trying to see if they were hide anywhere else and shouted out their names. 

Only silence answered me in return. 

I scrambled back toward their room. 

Then I saw the muddy fingerprints near their window and realized what had happened. 

I looked down toward the graveyard where the man had been standing staring for almost an hour toward our house in the ghost costume. 

Except now instead of one man, there were two.

9rqx5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9rqx5p/straw_walkers/,Straw Walkers,182,8,1540607510.0,"Every summer, right before school started, my parents stuck my kid brother'n me on a train out west to stay on my grandparent's farm for a week. They lived with their farmhand, Gus, and his two sons, Kit and Tom.

It all started with a scary story Kit and Tom told one night around the campfire about these creatures called ""straw walkers"" that the locals believed in. They were tall, scarecrow-like monsters who prowled fields at night and kidnapped kids. In order to keep 'em from hunting on *your* farm, you had to make 'em some kinda offering. And if they didn't get their offering, well, they'd come *lookin'* for one.

Kit and Tom said that's why, every night, we made sure to put the leftovers from dinner on the old oak stump out back by the barn. Even though the *real* reason was so the animals could eat 'em and they wouldn't go to waste.

That same summer we first heard the story, Kit and Tom started to prank us. Like, they'd take down one of the big straw scarecrows from the field and hide him somewhere he didn't belong - somewhere like right outside the bathroom door. Somewhere you'd turn the corner and scream, just to hear 'em laughing from their hiding spot. Or, they'd wake us up in the middle of the night wearing an ol' burlap sack over their face. Or they'd stuff their clothes with straw and lay limp in the yard, then jump up and yell when you got too close. They got us every time.

This summer's different though. My brother'n me worked out the perfect prank to get back at 'em. The week before, we combined our allowances n'bought a pair of stilts just so we could pull it off.  We came prepared.

That first night  at grandma and grandpa's we had extra special company. Gus invited a lady friend and her two daughters over for dinner. There was plenty of food to go around, and we were all happy to have the surprise guests.

Later that night, after everyone was asleep, my brother n'me went out to the barn where the stilts were hidden. I helped him into a pair of grandpa's overalls and a long flannel. We stuffed every inch of him with straw until it started busting out of his clothes. We cut up a burlap sack, stuck it over his head, and then added the final touch - an old straw hat we found in the attic. Creepy.

With the trap set, I snuck quietly back into the house and screamed from my bedroom. When everybody came runnin' in, they found me staring out the window looking into the field where a six-foot tall scarecrow could be seen in the moonlight walking through the high grass.

Gus and my grandparents exchanged panicked looks, and with a nod, Gus was gone.

Confused, I asked what was wrong.

Grandpa's voice was grim, ""there were no leftovers tonight.""

A blob of them chained together to form my name- ***A a r o n***. The rest scurried around in in an endless chain.

By my face was a post-it note with sawdust on it. The sawdust formed a passable impression of a chicken.

""Okay,"" I said aloud. The ants went crazy, twitching their legs and antennas.

An incredibly strange voice enter my head- something of a mix between a car engine revving and a bucket of chum being spilled onto the floor.

*""great aaron we beseech thy power and complete the rituals. we invoke thy holy name. we offer you a symbol of thy favorite food. grant us our wish.""*

""Fire away,"" I said.

The voice continued. *""we are at war. the enemy nest swarm in greater numbers. rain down hellfire upon them!""*

I double checked the note, careful not to ruin it by shifting the sawdust. ""I'm impressed. I didn't know ants could draw chickens. The feathers are very well done.""

*""thank you.""*

""But for next time, most humans eat the chicken with the feathers plucked. Cooked, normally. Whereabouts is this nest?""

I went out to the oak tree in my neighbor's front yard with a can of Raid, explaining to her that I'd had ants on my property and had tracked them over to her yard. She gave me a thumbs up and went on her way to work.

Directed by my new high priest of the ants, I tore up the dirt and the grass to find their tunnels and tracked them down into the root system. The enemy nest died by the thousands. I sprayed and sprayed til my brand new can of bug killer was empty.

*""hurrah hurrah the evil is slain! praise be unto aaron the slayer of the enemy!""*

I drove to the mall later to grab some Chick-fil-a for lunch and to grab a fresh can of Raid from Home Depot.

Whatever machinations let them talk to my mind let my find their tunnels. It's very difficult to explain- I guess its a psychic ant thing.

I tracked the paths they took to bring food into the nest and drenched them; I systematically sprayed off their paths of retreat. I had to pry open off of my floor boards to reach the hub of the nest in my house.

*""oh aaron we your servants beg your pardon! how have we offended you? what sin have you detected in us? we-""*

The psychic connection cut off once the Raid hit the queen ant.

I'm not even sure why I didn't it. I guess I just felt like it. Honestly, though, it was kinda cool having worshippers for a day."

I was in a waiting room, that much was obvious, but I didn’t know what I was waiting for. A woman poked her head out of a door and looked right at me.

“Come on in Karen. We’re ready for you.” I stood and walked into her office, and sat down in the impossibly comfy chair. The woman sat down across from me and picked up a file that appeared on her desk.

“Welcome to The Afterlife. Sorry, we’re a little backed up today – there were a few major incidents. Now, before we get started, do you have any questions?”

I looked around the office, and realized I knew exactly where I was. I was in Heaven! Of course I was, I was great, wasn’t I? I had an amazing life, raising a perfect daughter into an accomplished young woman. And I had lost my husband too early – surely this was a reward to those painful years without him.

“So, what happens to me now?” I asked, smiling at the woman in front of me. “Well, what we do is put you back in your favorite day. It’s on a time loop, so you get to relive it over and over however you choose. Every day is the same, and you get to relive that one day for all eternity.”

“Oh, that’s easy. I’ve always told everyone it’s the day my daughter was born.” I replied quickly. The woman smiled, almost eerily, and looked me dead in the eye, tilting up her face to do to. “As you wish”. I blink and everything was different. I was in a dimly lit hospital room. A sudden pain wrapped around me, and I screamed, surprised.

“Now Mrs. Summers, there’s no need for that.” The doctor’s face appeared in front of me, as he stood up between my knees. “There are other women trying to sleep, and it’s just past midnight. And you’re only at 6 centimeters. It’s going to get a lot worse.” I then remembered that I had had quite a long labour. This thought was interrupted by another contraction. I found myself slipping back into the mentality I’d had the first time through – just get through this, and then you can see you daughter. Hold your little baby. Bask in the glow of attention that being a young, attractive mom gets you, from both your husband and strangers. And then I was there, teetering on the precipice of that moment. I could barely hear my husband and the doctor, through the sharp, intense pain of delivery, and the rush of excitement. And then there she was! Screaming in the doctors arms, free of the cord! He stepped towards me, shifting her, preparing to hand her over when…

Shawn, Joe, and Mark, three 12 year olds donning the latest superhero movie costumes, were no exception to that law.


“What are we doing first?” Mark exclaimed.  “I wanna go on rides!”


Joe ogled some of their female schoolmates laughing by the Ring Toss.  “Nah, let’s play some games first.”


“What about that?” Shawn pointed and all turned towards a red and yellow striped tent, in a shadowy corner of the fairground.


After some debate, the boys wandered over to the tent.  Inside the entrance an impossibly tall, skinny man with a crooked nose greeted them.  The tux he wore was too short, showing off his knobby wrists and ankles.  “Welcome boys, to the House of Gorror!”


Mark rolled his eyes and Joe let out a soft “Niiiiiice.”


“After passing through the curtain behind me, you will feel your way to each station, in which resides a bowl.  In each bow is a bit of gore that you will only experience with your sense of touch.  All for just one dollar!  There is only one caveat…”  The man held up three black blindfolds.  “You must wear these the whole time.  Without them the gorror would not be as… Gorrific!”


The boys exchanged smirks, but put on the blindfolds nonetheless.  The man guided them to the curtain.  “Remember boys… blindfolds ON.”


Joe led the way to the first station, and they all stuck their hands in the bowl and felt around.  “Peeled grapes,” Mark giggled.


The next bowl had slimy strings slipping through their fingers.  Shawn thought of his mom’s spaghetti and gagged a little at how much it really did feel like guts.


The next few stations were ears, brains, and hearts.  Or obviously, as the boys thought, dried apples, Jell-O, and peeled tomatoes.  At the last station, feed corn, Shawn couldn’t help himself.  “OoOoOoOo TeeeEEEeeeEEEeeeth!”


The boys erupted in laughter, which continued as they exited the room through the curtain.  They handed the blindfolds back to the man, along with a dollar each.  “Not bad,” Joe smirked.  “Though I thought the Jell-O brains were a little dried out.”


“Ah yes, can’t fool you boys.”  The man tapped his temple.  “Too smart to be tricked.”


“You did your best old man.  Later!”  With that the three turned and left, a night of rides, and games, and fair food ahead of them.  The man watched them go, sighing heavily as he clutched the blindfolds.  Every so often he had one little shit challenge his blindfold rule, and he was surprised he struck out this time.


Moving through the curtain he walked to the first station and looked into the bowl.  23 socketless eyes stared back up at him.  “The night is young still,” he mused, as a cunning smile crept over his lips.  “And the brains will need replacing soon…”

> Mario Elsa, Spid .. Ironman, Spiderman Elsa, bug, Goblin Darth Vader, Goblin Stormtrooper. Fridge. Seven.

“Ok, next house!”

I guess the siblings bought the same masks. They are pretty realistic looking. Oh great, now they are even making creepy growling sound and started drooling. 

“GET DOWN FROM THAT MAILBOX THIS INSTANT GOBLIN DARTH VADER.”

ok,

“Ok guys, 3 more houses left.”

They are completely wild now, the sugar rush must have gotten to them. Hm, these Snickers are great. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STENCH, it's like someone brought a dead chicken with them.

Alright,

“Ok to the blue house!”

They are all making creepy goblin barking and snarling. Gross. Where did they get those masks anyway? Uh, I can’t wait for this to be over so I can sneak off to the party.

ok. 

> Goblin, Goblin, Goblin, Spiderman Elsa, Goblin, Goblin, Goblin.

“OK, last house.”

Oh god they are running and jumping around like dogs and monkeys now. they must have eaten a lot of sugar. Would they stop making those creepy noises

> Goblin, Goblin, Goblin, Goblin, Goblin, Goblin, Goblin. Seven! 

Didn’t lose a single one of them. Great, They are running around like wild animals. Uhhhhg I can't wait for this to be done.

“Ok, I am short on time, so we are taking a shortcut through the woods. Don’t worry, I got a flashlight. Everybody stay behind me, I will walk first.”
 
They all instantly got quiet. As I stepped into the woods, they quickly followed behind me. I have never seen them so obedient. I could hear them making creepy giggles as they trail behind me through the woods. “I hope you guys are ready for dinner, because I am starving for some meat.”"

The family consisted of a mother and a father with their two young daughters. One of the daughters were more loved than the other. Which made the other daughter lonely and depressed. She even felt outside the family sometimes. Alice the lonely daughter ones received a paranormal massage from the other side. The other family members realized shortly after a change in her mood and behavior. She started acting really weird and the family got worried. At the same time they noticed that their cows started to get sick and all the cows had been wounded, but they didn’t know how.** 

**October 31st was a rainy night and Alice went outside to feed the cows. Suddenly the family heard a strange noise and rushed out to the farm. When they arrived they saw all the cows laying dead on the floor and their possessed daughter standing right in front of them. The blood dripped down the pitchfork she was holding with her bare hands.** 

**She started screaming in a language they didn’t understood. They tried to calm her down and bring her inside the house. She refused, but the dad forced her with violence. When they arrived at the front door at the house they saw five possessed girls, all dressed in white nightwear. All five girls started screaming in the same strange language as Alice did earlier in the farm. Suddenly the whole world went black for the father, mother and their other daughter...**

**Two weeks later a seven year old boy and his grandfather were hiking in the woods. When they arrived at the old farm they saw something hanging in the big old three about 150 feet away. They didn’t see exactly what was hanging in the three so they went to take a closer look. The grandfather shortly realized that it was three pale corpses hanging in the three. A man, woman and a little girl.**"

There were dead bodies everywhere. Two on the living room floor, two leaning on the arms of the stale couch. I recognized them all. My little brother, my sister, mom and dad. My whole family.

At 23 I can safely say I've never been. It never interested me enough and the idea of this celebration is beyond me. This year would be different.

My mum had left a few weeks ago. No explanation. No note. No info...just gone. It's been filed with the police. Another missing.

It feels too lonely in the house now. Some work colleagues invited me to join them. Honestly, I need the company. Wherever it be. Even there, tonight. I shouldn't be alone. My first time. This year would be different.

I refuse to believe she was taken. Another missing. I can't explain why she might leave, but anything's better than knowing she will never come back.

The stalls of food and games were packed around the site. Everyone enjoying themselves, biding their time until the evening's final entertainment - the Burning of the Martyr. A straw effigy of a man, burned at the top of a bonfire. A figurative metaphor of releasing our sins to the night. A cleansing ritual, of sorts. This year would be different.

The last thing she said to me, the night before she left, ""Don't let anyone tell you who you are. You can only be who YOU want to be. Goodnight son. I'll have pancakes ready for the morning."" Little did I know there wouldn't be any pancakes. There wouldn't be...her.

Everyone was gathering around the bonfire now. I had split from my colleagues to get a closer look. I was starting to feel the community spirit. Maybe I could use this 'ritual' to make me feel better. Maybe find some answers. As I near the front I look up at the effigy. It had been dressed, randomly it seemed, to make it look creepier on a night like tonight. A tartan scarf, wrapped like a sash. Clown sized shoes pushed onto the stumps. A top hat/monocle combo, a bracelet hanging from a feminine glove. A silver chain with glimmering Peridot's linking down to a catholic cross. A bracelet just like mother's...just as the fire took I notice the sheen of an un-blinking eye behind the monocle. Tonight my mother's sins would be released. Free into the night. Free to find me.

This year would be different..."

School lets out early and the activities begin with a parade down Main Street. Thick clots of costumed children coagulate around the curbs. They shriek for candy as monsters and specters dance past with their buckets of treats. Women stand in tight knots, clucking. Elvira, Morticia and Bride of Frankenstein laugh together behind their hands. Men stand in lines drinking tepid beer from plastic cups. Their greasy face paint streaks in the heat. They leer as the high school girls twirl by wearing animal ears and little else. The steady pulse of the drumline can be heard for miles.

I love the Halloween Festival. There are monsters everywhere. No one notices me. I discern my targets and wait for night to fall.

The sun sets. Machine fog rolls through the streets of the neighborhood. Trick-or-treaters trample flower gardens. A cacophony of music and screams echo through the night, banishing peace and sleep. As buckets and bags fill up with candy, the crowd makes its way to the field on the East side of town. Carnival rides and games are set up there. Children, mouths tacky with chocolate, scramble from station to station. A local band plays covers on a fiberboard stage while zombies, vampires, and ghouls dance in the strobe-lit fog. It is here that I find my victim.

He has a five-o-clock shadow and a pot belly. His eyes and mouth are smeared with black makeup and stage blood covers his tattered clothes. He thinks it is his lucky night, there behind the concession stand. I saw him leering at the cheerleaders in the parade, though he ignored his own children. His breath comes ragged as he begins to stroke my breasts, which only just began to blossom a couple of years ago. I plunge my knife in just below his jaw. His blood is a nice addition to my costume. 

I make my way back toward the music. I can do at least a couple more, tonight."

Everyone would dress up in exciting new costumes and the best one would win the so desired price which was a 5 dollar Amazon gift card! There was one year where there was a guy who dressed up in a very impressive costume. He was covered in chains and had long black hair which covered his face. That year he took home the price for the best halloween costume. Minutes later I decided to go and congratulate him, but he was nowhere to be found. Everyone looked around for him and we even did a head count of everyone that was at the party. It was quickly noted that the guy was gone as well as one of the Andersson twins. This would remain the talk of the town for the next year! There would be various police investigations regarding this case but the guy and the Andersson twin were nowhere to be found. The next year the same halloween party was arranged and many thought they had located the Andersson twin since there was someone dressed up in the same identical costume as he had worn the previous year. However when the old lady across the street, Ms.Britt, went to get some fruit punch she found the Andersson twins head in the bowl and the person with the identical costume was gone as well! "

The thick carpet gave under her feet as she sat in a lounge chair, eyeing a large basket filled with Halloween candy on a table.  She got up and helped herself to some miniature bags of Skittles.  Marvin had loved Halloween, and had such a sweet tooth, she thought.  Poor Marvin.  Little had he known yesterday as he sat in his bath robe drinking Heineken and watching Planet of the Apes that he'd be dead before suppertime.  He was only 68, but when it's time to check out, it's time to check out.  

A tall, handsome guy in his 30s entered the lobby, and warmly greeted the new widow.  ""Hello, Mrs. Green!  I'm Andy.  I want to offer you my condolences, and will be assisting you in making arrangements"".  Irene spent the next hour going over the hymns, the obituary, what Marvin was to wear, what kind of flowers to order, which cemetery would be the recipient of his mortal remains, and selecting from a list of steel and concrete burial vaults so Marvin would be sealed away from the elements beneath the wet dirt.  

Andy smiled.  ""Well, Mrs. Green, there's just one thing left, and that's to select a casket"".  He led the grieving woman to a room filled with caskets and coffins.  

Mrs. Green looked in awe at all the choices.  ""This one is 18 gauge steel, and the interior is velvet,"" the young mortician informed her.  ""And over here, solid oak"".  He showed her steel, copper, maple wood, pecan wood, pine, and even a mahogany replica of Nancy Reagan's casket, which was named the ""Nancy Reagan"" after the dead former first lady. 

Irene turned around, and cooed in excitement.  ""Oh, I like this one!"".  She walked up to a shiny golden casket way in the corner of the room.  

Andy's stuck-on smile faded.  ""Uh, no, Mrs. Green, that one's not...""

The widow ignored him.  ""This one's perfect!  It's gold, isn't it?  I want it!  Nothing but the best for my Marvin!""

Andy followed her, protesting, ""Irene, no, that...""

Still paying Andy no heed, Irene went right up to the casket, grabbed the lid, and lifted.  Within two seconds, Irene Green was running out the door, screaming at the top of her lungs.  Andy stood there, shaking his head.  He walked up to the casket, and looked reverently inside.  ""Sorry, Mom."" He kissed the mummified face of the woman inside, and closed the lid.  ""I guess we'll have to move you to the attic!"". "

I don't want to go back...,56,2,1540518875.0,"I first heard it this summer in a public pool, when I was floating underwater. This faint screaming sound, like an animal being slaughtered. Every day since then, it's been getting louder and louder.

I took my parents' car and went to the doctor without telling them. He asked if I listened to too much music. I told him I didn't. Besides, this wasn't a ringing sound like he was describing. It was a blood-curdling, animal scream, like someone was being tortured...

I had nightmares about it. I kept thinking someone was in trouble. Desperate for relief, I went to the doctor again later that week. He told me I should seek mental help.

Therapy was expensive. How was I going to ask my parents? Fortunately, they let me go. The psychiatrist was old and kept writing something down on a notepad. When I finished talking, he looked up and said ""Yes, it seems we have another case,"" and tapped the pen on his chin.

I asked him ""What?"" and he just said, ""They'll explain it to you.""

He handed me a paper. I thought it would have a prescription, but it only had an address on it, to somewhere called ""Alto Medical Group.""

Something felt so off, but I was desperate so I put it in my phone. I found the sign in a run-down part of town. I pushed open the door and the guy behind the counter made me fill out some paperwork.

When I met with the new doctor, he told me I needed a minor surgery. I just nodded. Anything to ease the screaming. I followed him into a small room, one with only a counter with cabinets and one chair. He injected anesthesia into my arm.

""Alright, now relax,"" he said, then brought out a small black briefcase. He clicked it open and pulled out something like a long fishing hook with spines all over it.

I screamed and tried to run but my arms and legs, my whole body, were paralyzed. He leaned over me, took the razor and carved into the flesh in my ear. My head throbbed in agony. Blood spilled all over my neck and in the collar of my shirt.

The next thing I remember was waking up, disoriented, seeing him smiling, holding something between his fingers. It was fleshy and squirming, with two arms and legs, covered in blood like a child fresh from its mother's womb. When it opened its mouth, I saw rows of little jagged teeth and heard the screaming sound again.

I went home that night shocked, not knowing who to tell. Who would believe me? I wore a hoodie to school so no one could see my ear...

The screaming stopped after that. About a month later, I was asleep in my bed when I started hearing it again. It's getting louder every day.

Please, if any of you know another way, please help me. I don't want to go back...

Handing him the pillowcase full of wrapped candies, fun sized chocolate bars, generic holiday-themed sweets, and occasional pencil/eraser combo, his dad made steady eye contact; “Remember what we talked about, no more than 5 pieces before bed.”
 
    After his dad left, he began shoveling in a handful of sweets quickly to make sure he couldn’t be held to such a ridiculously low quota, and he chewed vigorously while he awaited the parental return that indicated the end of his Halloween binge. 
 
   As he started to hear footfalls in the hallway, he swallowed a lump of candy and felt a sharp, searing pain in his throat, probably too many Tootsie Rolls and too little chewing.  The second attempt to gulp down sweets hurt a lot more, and he started to choke on what felt like chocolate syrup, but tasted like pennies.  As his coughing grew heavier, the ball of candy flew out of his mouth, and his vision grew dimmer, he saw his dad come running into the room and grab the pillowcase while screaming for his mom to call 911.

His new girlfriend’s life.

She stood up after stabbing the woman, and saving her divorced husband, and walked over to him and tried to hug him, but he shook her off.

“You killed her.” He whispered.

“Yes, but don’t you see, she almost killed you.” She said and told him the whole story as if he hadn’t seen it, but he did. All he saw was his divorced wife kill his new girlfriend. It was insanity.

“No, you killed her. I’m calling the police.” He said and picked up his phone and made sure that she stayed there on the couch. The divorced wife said nothing.

What her divorced husband didn’t see was the loaded gun in her pocket. In case that plan didn’t work, he didn’t see her put the poison in their drinks. Her divorced husband didn’t see any of this, and how could he not. She still loved him, somehow.

“I saved your fucking life.” She said fiercely and he looked back at her solemnly.

“No.” He said. “No you didn’t. You ruined it.”

*“No, you ruined mine.”* She thought while she sat there, with the knife still in her hand. How many times had he cheated on her? Hit her? Given her the silent treatment?

How many second chances had she given him?

*“Way too many.”* She thought, and then, smiled at her new thought. She thought of the dog that barked every night at her house. It kept her awake at night, and all she could do was listen.

Insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

Insanity. Giving your husband second chances and expecting it to change, but it didn’t. It never would.

She looked over at her divorced husband, with his back turned. The husband she loved. Maybe that’s why his girlfriend wanted to kill him. Perhaps that’s why she was humming as she made the drinks and held the gun in her coat. She loved him so much. So much.

“Hmmmmmmm.” The girlfriend hummed.

The divorced wife started to make that noise too. It was actually quite fun, and not because it was tickling her lips, but because it made absolute sense. No more second chances. It was simple.

The divorced wife stood up and walked towards him. She wanted to make it up to him, and she knew how.

So she walked to him. To forgive him.

If you didn’t know that translates to love, but that feline was far from loving. It was an abomination that crawled from hell.  Mom said she’d be a wonderful edition to our family, an affectionate source of comfort in a desolate house that had only occupied the two of us. In all honestly, I think she bought her so that she could try and move on after my father’s death.

Nevertheless, the first day Amory was brought into what would be her new home she locked eyes with me, her pupils expanded to frightening levels before she darted up the stairs and scampered into my room. That became Amory’s designated space of comfort. Mom would bounce her around like a newborn, allow her to up on the kitchen counter, hell she bought a custom catbowl made of bronze inscribed with the cat’s name.

Amory’s hostility towards me began one day when I was working on an essay for my chemistry class. She was splayed out on my bed and was purring so loudly that I’m sure you could hear it from the end of the hallway. After becoming bored, she thought it suitable jump up leap on my table, hitting the delete button with her tail on the way, and look at me. Frustrated, I told her just how much of a nuisance she was. It’s common sense that cats can’t understand human language, but the way she listened to my tirade was uncanny. And by the end, those incandescent green orbs burned with malice, the smouldering gaze of that black and white ball of fur, claws teeth and all, threatened to have me spontaneously combust.  I was lost in the glare of a predator, I had forgotten I was several times larger than the small terror perched in front of me. It’s crazy but she smiled.

I became so afraid of that demon that I ended up dreaming that she attacked me in the living room. Her razor sharp fangs had punctured my jugular and she’d pulled back several times to rip it out. I could feel the pain with each tug. My body collapsed to the floor in pain. And as I faded in and out of consciousness, I felt a paw on my head.

I jumped up in fear and screamed. Mom rose up in concern and asked me what was wrong. Why she was in my bed, and more pressing, why did she call me Amory?  I became aware of how large the room was, almost threatening to swallow me whole, then I saw the pictures plastered all over the walls. Realization dawned on me; I bolted from my mother’s room to mine to see myself, no -  Amory sitting there holding a dead mouse in her hand. She flicked it in boredom a few times before noticing me. An uncanny smile crossed her face before she crushed the creature in her hand.

I had seen him before several times, walking in and out of my apartment building. He was average looking with average clothes, the kind of person you pass over for a promotion in favour of a more attractive colleague, and there was a lack of vitality about him that I found repressing and insulting to my good spirits, like his mere presence was an obstacle to my potential as a man.

I waited for him to enter the sheltered gateway that connects the back of my building from the road and hit him in the back of the head with a jagged brick. Then I squeezed on his throat while he squirmed, until I felt his trachea crunch in my palm.

The moment he went limp I felt a great energy surge through my spine and limbs. It was as if I had released the light from a bulb, or the paint from a canvas, or the emotion from a moving picture. I had the distinct sensation of not an absence, but a *merging*, as if the energy of the now lifeless form had been absorbed back into the uncreated void which permeates everything, and from which the Great Pattern springs.

I guess you could say I called death out, and found it bluffing.

Yes, dear reader. In that moment of savage bleakness, when the last gurgle of desperation had died on his spittle-flecked lips, his eyes glazed over, and in the silence that followed, I had a glimpse of beyond. In the flash I knew everything. Allow me to list the main things off for you. One: there is no moral arbiter to judge us. Two: the world, despite appearances, does not exist. It has never been created and, consequently, can never be destroyed, and there has never been a time when you and I have not lived.

Oh yes - the death of the dull man was an epiphany to me.

I can’t wait to do it again."

I don't even remember anything other than misery. I lost my parents when I was 12 years old. My husband cheated on me with my best friend. But the last straw was when I lost my 5 year old daughter in a car accident two years ago.

I have been devastated since then. My therapist suggested me to take part in social gatherings, to share my feelings with others. I was tired to live a life like this. So I thought of giving it a try. As Halloween was near I decided to celebrate this festival.

The day finally came. I decorated my house to make it as spooky as possible with  scary mannequins, jack-o-lanterns and a sign near the front gate saying - ""Beware trick-or-treaters"".

The sun had just set when I heard a knock on my front door followed by cute giggles. Four kids in adorable costumes shouted in unison -'trick or treat'. I haven't seen so much innocence before. I wanted to give them all the candies I had. But I knew two candy bars each were enough to bring a smile on their faces and hence mine too.

When I was done for the day I was feeling exhausted. This much work I haven't done in years. But there was an immense satisfaction in my heart. As I knew the next morning everyone will know how I felt when I lost my daughter. My therapist was right as sharing feelings actually made me feel better.

&#x200B;

So many faceless kiddies running around, joyful, without a care in the world dressed as their heroes and dream induced fears, followed by reluctant parents door to door as the tradition dictates. 

&#x200B;

They dont know about *me..* the little children.. neither do the parents truly. Why would they? I'm as old as time itself always in the shadows, waiting patiently for *my time* never showing my true self. Its funny because you read about *monsters* who tear your child limb from limb, about the ones who snatch them up to gobble deep down in the sewers later...but not me...not the *real* me.  

&#x200B;

I seek out the child full of doubt... who questions whether they look good enough.. Do people like their costume, infact do people like *them?*  The child who looks at their parent, face buried in their phone escaping the task of spending quality time with their child, and wishes mommy or daddy would just acknowledge them for a moment..

&#x200B;

*That's the child I'm looking for.*

&#x200B;

 I creep behind their mask, both of them...the fake smile shown to the world, the lies of '*I'm fine*' and '*Nothings wrong Mom..*' and that's where i fester, as they grow older i grow too, with every doubt i grow stronger...louder always in the background feeding their fears and unanswerable questions. Its a long process but i dont mind, I'm part of you now and i have all the time in the world to steer you towards a tragic fate... the end is so so sweet in taste.

&#x200B;

Here i corrupt every meaningful connection you have..

&#x200B;

Your parents? Never really cared. 

Your best friend? Your friendship was just a joke to him.

Your Childhood love? Only stuck around to mock you behind your back.

&#x200B;

Until i have you alone...Parents no longer fitting the role of care givers, but now dealers of self loathing and paranoia in which you're always bound to go back to for another hit. Unable now to build meaningful relationships with anyone, instead preferring you're own company and mine, climbing the walls of your mind contaminating everything not leaving any room for hope to grow.

&#x200B;

You cant take anymore..

&#x200B;

{ *People dont want me around....I'm just a burden, and they're right...they'd all be better off without me...No.....surely not that?....I can't, i could never do that... But do i have any other choice?.. I'm so so tired i just want to leave it all behind....I'm drowning on dry land and no one can help me...Why doesn't anybody care about me?..Just a waste of a life, I'm sorry Mom..Dad..I never made you proud.....*

She had no idea where that wound on her thigh came from, perhaps she hit something hard at her physical demanding and on-the-go job, but this wound happened despite she had no memory of it. This unusual wound turned dark and oozed puss. Yesterday, during her break she wiped the wound with a clean, damp paper towel the moment she noticed the cut, and a shower after her work. However, the wound sent sharp pain throughout her body, and she had no choice but to get up in the middle of the night. Symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and slight fever hammered into her head, disorienting her consciousness. Thankfully, she lived just a few blocks from the local hospital. She changed to a more comfortable athletic pair of pants before leaving, hoping the professionals have a treatment for this wound. 

She slowly made her way down the flights of stairs, and walked toward the first block. She struggled her way to the hospital. She knew how to get there, the pain just exacerbated the trip. Her head was just making thinking clearly difficult. A good several steps passed the first block, she felt like she was being followed at this hour. She turned, but she thought she didn’t see anyone, or maybe she was hallucinating from lack of quality sleep. She continued, and just as she walked past a short alley behind a store, she heard a sudden movement of footsteps toward her, rapid stomps on the concrete ground. 

Next thing she knew, another human tackled her on the floor, and the pain of impact woke her up. She was fighting for her life now, as a hooded human’s hands got the upper hand to block her attempt to escape. Suddenly, the aggressor pushed her again with a burst of strength, and then lunged at her with a sharp object, leading to her untimely death in the silent alley. In her last breath, she tried to cry for help, instead, she coughed at the murderer’s face, coughing up wet liquid things because none can identify in the dark.

The murderer wiped off the fluid with a sleeve, and watched the victim laid motionless for a good minute before leaving the crime scene. The unseized murderer had another record added to the list of atrocities. Now, time to run home and clean up the bloodied clothes and weapons before anyone noticed. Thankfully, the dead victim pretty much cannot scream.

An hour after cleaning up the bloodied attire, the murderer popped open a cheap alcohol and chugged it to put the mind to sleep. The adrenaline thrill receded now, and the reporters would have the recent atrocity on broadcast in the next few days. Time to get a good night sleep.

Next morning, or afternoon rather, the culprit’s long, groggy sleep was interrupted by the development of the illness spreading throughout the body. Just as the criminal wanted to scream in pain, the police knocked the door, and seemingly found the criminal."

She was a sweet old woman who didn’t have many visitors throughout the year so Mary Shepard and her husband, Rick, always made it a point to attend.  Their friends around the block always declined for one reason or another, usually because they had to take their children out Trick-or-Treating. This year, though, most of the children were grown enough that they neither needed nor wanted their parents supervision so Mary and Rick decided they were going to do whatever they could to make sure Ms. Sprinkle’s dinner table was finally full.  It took some effort, and more than one bribe of leaf raking or bush trimming, but they managed to convince everyone to come round.  Ms. Sprinkle’s eyes gleamed as she greeted her guests, and she hugged Mary especially tightly before wandering into the kitchen to check on the meal.

“Did you find Barker yet?” Mary asked Barbara Lovett as they sat down to the table.

“No…” she said, trailing off and looking away.  “Ain’t seen him in two days.”

“You mean you *haven’t*seen him in two days?” Gabe Cochran interrupted.  His wife, Beverly, playfully slapped him on the shoulder.  Barbara and Mary ignored him. 

“I’m sorry,” Mary said. “I’m sure he will come back. Probably just chased a car a little too far, but someone will find him.”

“Yeah,” Barbara said. “I hope so.  Thanks, Mary.”

“Last year my cat ran away, too,” Susan Gates added.

“And never came back…” Barbara finished.  She rubbed her eyes and collected herself.  “Hey, where’s Rick at?”

“You mean, *where’s Rick*, right?” Gabe interjected again.

“I’m sure he’s on his way,” Mary snipped.

“I saw his car earlier!” Susan chimed in.  “I thought he was going to be the first one here!”

“Went back to the office, I bet!” Susan’s husband, Arnold, said.  “He’s addicted to that job.  Needs a little more beer in his life, if you ask me!”  Susan elbowed him in the rib.  Gabe and Beverly giggled.

The swinging door the led from the kitchen opened and Ms. Sprinkle appeared holding a giant white catering dish with a metal cover over it.  She stopped briefly and looked over her full table, smiling like a mother whose children had all come home for the holidays.  “I hope it’s ok,” she offered as she set the dish down in the center of the table.  “I had to make extra in a hurry.  Mary just called me a few hours ago to tell me you all were coming.”

“I’m sure it will be wonderful,” Mary said, smiling.  “What is it?”

“Shepard Pie,” Ms. Sprinkle said, lifting the metal cover, displaying a heaping pile of shredded meat, vegetables, and mashed potatoes.

“You mean *Shepherd’s Pie*?” Gabe asked, over-enunciating.

“Yes, dear,” Ms. Sprinkle said, grinning widely.  “I’m sure that’s what I meant.  Let’s eat.”"

In fact, I must honestly tell you, it can be anything, anything you desire

A full tempest choir, a chair by the fire, anything at all, anything you admire

You must give it attention, yes! Nothing else shall catch your eye

Because when you lie, it will know by and by, that’s why you must try

You must try to love it, love it with all your might

Always keep it in sight, never in flight, and be with it during the night!

If you don’t, well, I will not get into that today

But here is all I can say, if I may, there is a simple price to pay

For all that you want the most, and all that you cherish well

There is something you must sell, for the price of hell, for where you will forever dwell

But don’t let that stop you! If you buy this you will have a ball

The tears glistened on his face, and the wind rattled the trees which surrounded him. His head in one hand, a gun in the other, a choice weighed on his mind. He broke his stance to vomit, nauseous from the pain and stress. He let out a hallowing holler, heard by no one but the woods who tauntingly echoed it back to him. A streak of moonlight broke through the tree line, illuminating him. The weighted feeling on his stomach and chest lifted, and he felt light enough to float. His heart rushed as his mind fled, the moonlight pleasantly kissing his skin. He acquiesced, leaving the choice to the moon.

Naked and wet, he jarred awake. His body laid next to a stream, a morning glow shimmering in the water. He sat up, his reflection in the stream following diligently. They stared at each other, neither quite recognizing the other. Blood dripped from his lips into his reflection, the ripple of red distorting it. The songs of the birds and gentle cascading of the water couldn’t quite drown the sound of sirens in the distance. Slowly he remembered his choice. A choice that would again weigh on him for the next thirty days. A choice he’d have to again leave to the moon."

“Data is everything,” Fab says suddenly, cutting me off. “Before right now, data was just memories; historical information on specific things that could help us make educated guesses but couldn’t tell us with any accuracy where things were going. Now? It’s the flow of modern life. It’s what you eat, it’s what you do… it determines what you get when you express yourself or make a decision, or dare to use your imagination.”

“Data is just memories,” Pascal, his assistant, says, nodding. “Big data is the infinite.”

“We have replaced the spiritual with the numerical,” Fab continues. “And I have found they are the same thing.”

“You’ve found… *God*?” I whisper. 

“I’ve found…” Fab pauses, his eyes resting momentarily on the hungry gaze of the young Pascal, and, deciding something, waving the question off, he says, “several billion ways to market concealer sticks to teenagers with acne – girls *and* boys. Thirteen billion two hundred thousand ways to sell celebrity-endorsed cosmetics to young girls and women with self-esteem and body confidence issues.”

“What *else*?” Pascal cries, ecstatic. 

“Seven billion, six hundred and thirty-two ways to sell questionable supplements to repressed and emasculated males,” Fab continues, reading from a sheet. “Fourteen billion nineteen thousand ways to market clothing to girls and boys who have been brought up to believe the only way they are going to get laid is if they stay ‘fresh’.” He looks up from the sheet. “*Three hundred billion* ways to sell happiness, satisfaction, relief from pain…”

“That’s what we do really,” Pascal says, humble. “Sell happiness.”

“Big data is what the majority of us are talking to when we pray,” Fab says, turning back to me. “Now we can get our desires fulfilled in real-time, with same-day shipping in most cases.”

“It’s so easy,” Pascal whispers, wiping what I’m pretty sure is a tear from his eye. “So easy.”

“Long-term dreams and plans are done,” Fab says. “No one needs to feel down or abandoned anymore. Not with a high-speed Wi-Fi connection.”

“Same-day shipping,” Pascal says again, shaking his head in disbelief. “Why *wait*?”

“And everyone can have this,” Fab says. “As long as they *let us in*. Share their thoughts and impulses, their personal info. You can have everything as long as you let go of your individuality, your selfishness, your *shame*, and become one with the data-stream.”

“Join us,” Pascal says, his eyes gleaming, “and you can have it *all*.” He smiles. “The car, the clothes, the houses, the dates... *love*.”

I look at each of them, my mouth open, realising they’re waiting eagerly for me to say something. I rapidly reflect on my life - my once shining potential - and then into the future, and the 30-40 years of watching numbers on a screen. 

“I, uh, guess I’ll take it,” I say. "

“Where are you going?” Mrs. Muskgrove asked irritatedly “Don’t you want to trick or treat?”

“I just have to check something.”

She rolled her eyes. A minute passed, then there was a knock on the door. She opened the door and gasped. There was Charlie in his super man out fit staring at her with wide eyes.

“Charlie, Baby how did you get out here?”

“It doesn’t work.”

“What doesn’t work?”

“My super man suit. See?”

She looked down and saw the gaping hole in her sons chest. She screamed and suddenly the door way was empty. She shivered.
What had that been?

“Charlie Muskgrove get down here, now!”

“Wait, Mum..I’m almost done.”

She dropped into a chair.

Thank God it was just my imagination she said.

Then she heard Charlie’s voice “Faster then a speeding bullet it’s....”

Did they see me? I peered up the street through a slit in the blinds. They were clearly on the hunt. One's head scanned up and down my street while the other was concentrating, head down. In unison, they both headed towards my end of the cul de sac.

They always traveled in a pack of two, a master and an apprentice. They relied on guile and silver tongues to gain access to houses and then used their evil powers on the inhabitants. 

DO NOT LET THEM IN! The words of my late father came back to me. 

I raced upstairs to my bedroom and locked the door. From up there, I peered outside. They had no particular reason to stop at my house did they? My eyes widened as I saw my mistake. The hose. It was still pumping water out, forming a pool in my garden, creating an arterial flow down to the curb. 

I sank to the floor, all of my energy drained from me in a second. I knew what was coming, what it had to be. I plugged my ears and rocked myself, willing them away.

Bing-BONG!

No good, they were here. I knew it was useless to ignore them. Once they smelled their cornered prey, there was no stopping them. Now they were knocking; hard, insistently. They knew I was home. No sense denying it.

I stare up at the old man, confused. Mommy didn’t tell me this would happen. “I don’t get it,” I say, lifting my mask up off my face so I could see him better. His face pulled up into a wrinkly grin, revealing crooked yellow teeth.

“You said trick or treat,” he replies. “Well, if you want a treat, you have to show me a trick first. Something special.”

I look back towards my mom but she is staring at her phone, probably talking with daddy. He didn’t want me trick-or-treating, but I begged and begged and begged until mommy promised to take me. All the other kids got to go, so I wanted to go too. Daddy was pretty angry when we left.

Maybe daddy was right.

“Um…Oh! I can spell Albuquerque! My friends can't, but I can.”

“Can you now! And how old are you?” He leans down a little closer to me. His breath smells like fish.

“Um…eight.”

“That *is* pretty impressive. Why don’t you spell it for me?”

I spell it out slowly, keeping my eyes on the old man. He looks like a ghost that Scooby Doo would chase. I wonder if I pulled off his head, if there would be a different person underneath.

As I finish, the man stands back up. “That was very good! Would you like to see my trick?”

Something felt wrong, but this was my first time trick-or-treating and my very first house. Maybe this is how it’s supposed to go? I look back at mommy. She is still talking to daddy. “O…okay.”

The man smiled again, but his smile was too big. His teeth got bigger, way bigger than teeth should be. I want to run away but my body is frozen. I don’t want to be here anymore. I want to go home. I want mommy to save me. *Why won’t mommy save me?*

He reaches towards me. His fingers are too long, and his nails look like my kitty’s claws.

Suddenly he is back to normal, waving at someone behind me. I turn to see my mom waving back. She looks worried.

“Everything okay up there, Taylor?” she shouts. I don’t know what to say.

The old man speaks up, a normal, not-too-big smile on his face. “Sorry, I just asked her to perform a trick for me! She spelled Albuquerque, and it was very impressive. You have such a smart kid.” As he talks, I feel something fall into the pillowcase I’m holding. My body unfreezes.

“Th…thanks mister,” I shout as I run back to my mom. She grabs me by the shoulders and looks me over.

“Are you okay? That man seemed a little creepy. Maybe we should head back…”

I am about to agree with her when I look in my pillowcase and find a full-sized Mars bar. “No, let’s keep going,” I say as I march off towards the next house.

 “Ah, thank you dear” breezes the wife, hurriedly rifling through her purse for money. “You can just go ahead and leave the pizzas on the front porch.”

“You want me to leave your pizza on your *doorstep*?” I repeat, incredulous.

“That’s what we’re paying you for, isn’t it?” barks her white-haired husband.

His voice trails off suddenly as he notices something in the distance. 

Looking over my shoulder, I see a crowd of small figures approaching from the end of the road. In the dim moonlight, I can just about make out the trick-or-treaters’ decomposing costumes. What are the odds of every kid on the street dressing as the same monster?

That’s when it clicks—I didn’t see any other houses on my drive here. Only a graveyard…

Panicked, I turn back to see that the couple have slammed the door in my face. Unless I can coat these pizzas in fresh blood within the next minute, I’m zombie-chow.

I still don’t know what that little-round-plastic-table-thingy in the pizza box is for.

But, pressing its jagged prongs against my forearm, I think I’ve found *one* good use for it."

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to denigrate the pain that people who wish for it must be going through, but you have to understand the ramifications.  For a start there are queues, so many fucking queues.  Even as someone raised in England, where we elevated queuing to something akin to a sport, it’s a bit much.  There are no pearly gates, at least not in what I like to call the holding pen, for that is what it surely is.  If your idea of hell is having to deal with jumped up official’s carrying clipboards and frowns, then you would likely think that’s where you ended up.  Processing is a joke really, although you would have to search the depths of your soul to find the humour in it.  The worst part is that, for me, I know where I’m going, there is no doubt in my mind which line I have to join.

I didn’t want to die.  I had no desire to enter this otherworldly departure lounge, ready to take my final flight, but alcohol is a fickle mistress, full of grandiose promises and broken dreams.  I certainly shouldn’t have sunk the amount I did on a work day, that’s for damn sure.  I know I’m getting what I deserve, I know that there’s no weeding my way out of it, even if i do give it my best shot.

When It came time for me to speak to the humourless curmudgeon tasked with sorting people into their correct lines, I shot him a hopeful look, and motioned to the queue I wanted to join.  He simply raised his eyebrows in disbelief and pointed me in the other direction.  I made an attempt to look shocked, but I was never that good an actor.

No, death is not all its cracked up to be at all, but at least I could comfort myself with the knowledge that I’d done it to myself.  It was the ones I’d taken with me who I felt for.  Looking across to the queue I’d wanted to join, I could only hope against hope that the thirty schoolchildren lined up there could find it in their hearts to forgive their bus driver.

But that was when Pops still had his factory job, before his high school best friend, the one with enough money to dodge the draft that snared Pops, bought out the whole place to make a Halloween-themed amusement park.


That year, we couldn't even splurge on any pumpkin. ""Just a little one for a scary face?"" I had pleaded, and Mom had shaken her head guiltily, her eyes furtively darting toward our old, ratty couch where Pops and his bottles reigned.


So it was a surprise, coming home to a round, fair-sized pumpkin waiting next to the door - with a new coat of paint - and the smell of pumpkin soup, Mom's secret recipe, wafting through the house. An even bigger surprise waited in the living room - a new couch, a tan one that felt like leather, and Pops was setting the table, the odor of stale beer no longer clinging to him like an ages-old grudge.


That was the best dinner we'd had in a long time; and my carved pumpkin, an image of Dracula half in, half out of a window, menacingly reaching for his intended, won first prize in the neighbourhood contest.


Life got better: Pops called in some old debts, enrolled himself in a twelve-step program, and earned his prized sobriety coin. Mom got a used car from an old friend, to replace the pile of crap that spent more time in the shop than the road. A new entrepreneur took over Pops' ex-buddy's business, which had fallen apart since the draft-dodger-turned-tax-dodger got the hell out of town. The new businessman offered Pops a permanent position, capitalizing on his intellect that had resurfaced after the demons of alcoholism disappeared, and the spectre of war horrors in his mind well-managed. Our family name again garnered respect; and my childhood returned to the carefreeness that any child should have. 


And now, as I watched the police inspector bagged the rest of the bones excavated from our back garden, where the pumpkin seeds from that night thrived; as Pops stood stoically, staring a hole through the detective telling him that the broken shovel found next to those human remains bore Mom's fingerprints; as we both recalled how her car broke down near Pops' ex-best friend's house a few weeks before Halloween that year, what was foremost on our mind wasn't how once again our family name plummeted to the dirt.


It was the aroma of pumpkin soup that I couldn't replicate no matter how many fancy chef schools I went to, the soup that we never enjoyed again after Mom passed; it was the bittersweet taste of sacrifice, of an unbreakable familial bond that was at the front of our minds, as Pops cryptically told the nosy reporters, ""My wife always said, don't pity the born monsters, pity those whose circumstances made them one""."

It is not as innocent as it may seem. I've been having some issue writing the last few months, because of writer's block, and I thought nothing of it, until I learned what it really was. I am writing a book about an outcast who decides to try to be a hero, and I have it all planned out, but words... Fail to fit together when I sit down to just write. Characters and events tend to bounce around your head for awhile as you stare at the empty page before you. That's always been my experience. My imagination takes off at points throughout the day and my creation becomes more, and more expansive, but no words are put down to bring these ideas to life. Information packs itself into my mind and it becomes so much that it suffocates me. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I realized the characters, my creations, were speaking to me directly. Taunting me. They began to dictate my life, my actions. Driving me insane, and then a few days ago, they made it into the real world. And I killed them, all of them. The smell was overwhelming, so I checked my basement, and found not my creations, but my husband and our children. I am currently sitting in a holding cell, awaiting trial, and they just won't stop laughing at me. And I can't ever get them out of my head, all there ever is, is a blank page."

The haul had been good so far, plenty of candy to share out at the end of the night. As they quickened their pace, Max, in his elaborate ghoul costume, tripped on the sidewalk.  With his costume tangled around his legs, he agreed to catch up with his friends at the end of the street.
       
Having sorted his costume, Max stood. Just then the light in the porch behind him came on. Eager to add to the nights tally, he walked up to the front door. Ringing the bell, he waited. After eating some of his sweets he decided to leave, then as he turned to walk away he heard the door open gently. Max turned back to see a frail, old man smiling at him through the doorway.
       
Kevin had waited long enough. He collared Raul and Gary and the trio made their way back to where they left Max. As they approached the spot,  the lights on the closest house went out. Suspicious, Kevin had a look around. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until he spotted a candy wrapper on the floor outside the front door. He called the other two to follow him for a closer look. Hesitantly, they followed.
       
Peering through the front windows they could only make out dusty furniture and dated upholsteries. Anyone would think the house was abandoned. Gut instinct told Kevin that Max was inside. Instructing Raul to check the left side of the house and Gary to keep lookout, he made his way to the right, vaulting the side gate in the process.
       
Landing lightly, Kevin made his way slowly down the side of the house. Another window showed a long dis-used kitchen. A quick search showed nothing except more evidence of abandonment. Heading for the garden he peeked round the rear corner of the house to see the back door was slightly ajar. Wasting no time, he entered the house.
       
The air inside was heavy. Brushing cobwebs away as he moved through the corridor, Kevin noticed a dim light coming from an open door. He approached and, looking down some stairs, wondered if Raul had made it inside before he did. He slowly made his way down.
       
Reaching the bottom, he froze, all colour leaving his face. Wanting to run but rooted to the spot, his eyes teared as he looked from one friend to the next.
       
Max hung upside down, like a slaughtered animal. His blood draining out.
       
Gary lay on a stone table. His head seperated from his shoulders.

For the first week we just instant messaged. In the second week we spoke on the phone and talked for hours. 

Tonight is our first date. 

Now, I know what you’re going to say. You’re going to say “don’t go Ellie”, “what the hell do you think you’re doing?”, and all that good stuff, just as if you were my mama.

Don’t worry about her. I’m a good liar. 

If anyone asks you just say I’m at Rachel’s, or Beth’s, or any other of the girl’s houses that do dance and come to my birthday parties. 

Tonight is my night, and

The truth is you just wish you had a date like mine. A date so big he makes you feel small. A date who knows so much and talks so well that you just want to slide into his arms and listen forever. 

In my town it’s not easy to find good men. If you need proof of that you could just ask my mama. Lord knows the neighbours hear it often enough. And ever since the kids started going missing just after I was born there isn’t much hope for the rest of us. Not until we get old enough to leave and go to college.

Oh, didn’t you know that? Yep. Nine kids gone in 12 years. They call us the “kidnap capital” in the papers. Ever since my twin sister became the ninth last October things have changed.

There’s a new curfew.

There’s a nightly neighbourhood patrol - mostly my daddy and the other men who have lost daughters.

Luckily with my hair and makeup done so and my bra pushed up like this I look much older. No one stops me or even recognises me.

I’m at the meeting place now (halfway between the old cinema and the arcade) so wish me luck, I guess?

I can’t wait to meet him.

Now I’m feeling real nervous. Butterflies. 

The six men hidden in the alleys on either side of me almost make me jump out of my skin. I catch a glint of a knife in the streetlight. A rattle of a chain. My teeth begin to chatter, even though it’s not cold. My heart is pounding in my ears.

For a moment I think about running. Away from this town and this life and my memories. But then I see him. He approaches without a care in the world. Now that he's close he doesn't really look like his photos. 

He smiles at me, oblivious.

You see, everybody is scared of my daddy and his friends. 

Everybody except my date. 

I guess he’ll learn tonight. "

She loved Fred, and she loved spending time with him, but it was always nice to have some time to spend alone. She even had a ritual. She’d drive him to the airport, and then when she got home, she’d order her favourite take out to be delivered. Then she’d spend a lovely week in a luxurious bubble of solitude. She didn’t have any close friends – she hadn’t for years. Her local pub’s delivery guy was the only person she saw regularly. It was so hard to be close friends with anyone, with social anxiety always in the back of your brain murmuring “what if they don’t like you? Are you sure you should be saying this? Why are you oversharing so much?” Combined with her depression, sometimes it was hard to even get out of bed in the mornings. Which is why she was so lucky to have Fred. He enjoyed working, Becky, and the finer things in life – in that order – which is what made it possible for her not to have to work. She knew she was very lucky, having a wonderful man like Fred, who loved her just the way she was, and understood that she simply couldn’t work. He provided for her, and in return, she loved him, and kept the house clean, cooked for him, took care of all those little things that you don’t have time for when you work a steady full time job. Cleaning always relaxed her, and just that afternoon, before she drove Fred to the airport, she had polished the silverware and waxed the hardwood until it gleamed. Her whole house was beautiful and polished, and ready for an entire 7 days of Netflix and chill – solo style. Yes, Becky knew she was lucky to live such a charmed life.

Which is why she was so surprised to find herself here. Her dinner was on the table, having just been delivered. He knew she only ordered about once a month, when Fred was away for his usual trip. He’d even joked about it when he’d handed her the food – “see you next Month Becky!” She’d joked back, some trivial piece of banter causally tossed out, and then she’d turned off the porch lights, so as to give the impression no one was home. She didn’t want to be bothered by any solicitors. She’d set the table for her dinner, and then realized her phone was upstairs. Halfway up to get it, she’d slipped on those stairs she’d cleaned so well just hours earlier. During her tumble, she’d heard a loud crack. Now, as she lay in a heap at the bottom of the stairs, she was aware of just two things.

1. She couldn’t wiggle anything – her fingers, her toes, her arms, or her legs.
2. Fred wasn’t expecting to hear from her for 7 days – and the delivery guy wasn’t expecting to hear from her for a month."

All of you have read my blog and know of my introverted personality, and how I don’t talk about my personal life often. But you know my brothers death has affected my life for the worse.
It started a year ago when I was camping- I love camping, you’ve all seen my vlogs- and it wasn’t my fault it really wasn’t. 
It was me and bill and John and vlad and my brother, we each had our own tents, vlad had one of the big ones. It wasn’t my fault.
So me and John and vlad were sitting round the fire whilst Bill phoned his girlfriend to tell her that he’d left his door open and asked her to lock it with her key. Bill has a huge house. We all know Cindy is a massive gold digger but bill won’t admit it. Again, it wasn’t my fault
The topic turned to joking about the clowns that were going around in 2016, and we were laughing about how scared people got and vlad started to smoke his vape but I stopped him.
I’ve always hated clowns.
They scare me.
They always have.
And I can’t change that

It wasn’t my fault

I remember this part the most vividly. The smell of the smoke had died down, we all finished eating the food we brought, I didn’t know where my brother was. His tent was open but he wasn’t there. The sky was beginning to turn from crimson to black, a dark, sickening black I can still remember, it made my blood boil. I hate black. There was a constant clicking and I don’t remember who said it but somebody said that it sounded like a camera.i could see a figure with their hands up to their face in the distance and I could make out a big wig and large trousers and they looked like a stereotypical clown and I told bill and he could see it and we were all scared.

""You, your Brother Davey and I shall camp on top of that hill Anna my dear"" their grandpa answered.  They made it to the top of the hill and saw a clearing in the forest.

Meanwhile, an old woman was nearby the woods on a back porch of a cottage and she knitted a shirt as she rocked away in her rocking-chair.  There were sounds of footsteps crunching twigs and branches.  ""George!  Is that you and our bratty Grandchildren?  It was a stupid idea to take them camping.  It was even dumb to have children and let those brats have their own children.  If you would have divorced me, I would have left you and abandoned our kids in these woods you stupid cow"" the old lady yelled at the sounds.

Anna, Davey and their grandpa were visited five minutes later by the monster.  ""Good evening, Mr. George Jackson, I, The Bone-Eater have returned.

It was nothing short of Paradise for us! My father bought a mansion on the outskirts of the town with a sprawling lawn and a backyard that gave way to a lush forest and mountains. This suited us well, my father and I were avid hunters.

Brian, Shawna and Ted were the first kids to turn up at our new house.

“Are you afraid of the forest?”, asked Ted “It’s dark and they say monsters lurk in it. I’d stay away if I were you!”

“No, I’m not!”, I laughed “My father and I went hunting all the time where we come from. There’s no monster in there, just animals and trees.”

Ted seemed unconvinced but he dropped the matter. We spent the rest of the day and the weekend playing in my huge yard.

Halloween night found me knocking on Brian’s door. The four of us had made plans to meet up at Brian’s, from where we’d go trick-or-treating together. I was the last to arrive and the others were already there. Brian’s mom was putting the final finishing touches to his mummy costume.

Ted was a plumber and Shawna look like a really cute demon.

“Nice costume!” Shawna grinned. 

I was about to thank her when Ted took me aside “Listen,” he said “I know this is your first Halloween here, and I don’t want to ruin the fun, but stick close to us tonight, all right? Charlie and his gang are known to beat up kids like us and take away all our candy. Just take care and run if you see those three.”

“All right, I’ll do that.” I said.

Two hours later we were all done and counting our loot in front of Brian’s house.

“Good loot this year!”, Ted said, peering into his bag.

“Me too.”, Shawna joined in.

“I don’t much like chocolate. It gives me cramps. Wanna trade?”, I said.

15 minutes later we were all done and were on our way to our houses.

Walking alone at night on the way home, the forest seemed alluring in the soft moonlight and I decided to take a stroll through it. No sooner had I entered the forest that I found my way blocked by three huge shadows.

“Trick or Treat!”, yelled the larger of the three “Hand it over or say goodbye to your nose!”

“I’m not afraid of you.” I said.

“Well, you should be!” he replied.

“You think that I’m afraid of you?” I said “You think I should cower before you. All because you are big and all because you assumed… Well, all because you assume that I’m human.”

Winnie was roused at about midnight.  It was Halloween.  She heard a knock on the door.  A deep voice said, ""Time for your medicine, Winnie!""

Groggy and irritated, she shouted, ""Get lost, you creep!""

The door opened, and in walked a tall, glowing figure.  Its flesh was green and luminescent.  It had the coldest black eyes, and long, glowing red hair.  The phantom wore a black robe.  ""That wasn't nice to say, Winnie!"" the ghoul snickered.  ""We're here to help you.  We care.  And now, your medicine!""

The figure reached inside the robe, pulling out a fat boa constrictor.  ""Say hi to our therapy animal!  Mr. Sparkles is pleased to meet you!""

Throughout the hallway, residents heard screaming, then choking.  After a few minutes, silence.  The nurses assured everyone all was well.  Just a bad dream.  That's all, a bad dream.  "

She is short and stout, with a round face and long, silver hair going down her sides and always flowing as if some kinda invisible, incorporeal wind blows at her constantly. Clearly, she's old. Or she was when she died. 

For she is dead, I'm sure of that. She's a ghost, but why exactly she torments me, I do not know. Maybe she's tied to the appartment I moved into... When exactly? I don't quite remember. Odd.   Must be lack of sleep mucking up my memory.

I sleep badly, cause she is always staring at me. Everywhere I turn. When I lay on my back, she's up on the ceiling. When I turn to my side, she stands in front of me. The worst is when she crawls into bed next to me, making me feel her cold seeping into my body. It's enough to drive anyone mad, isn't it? Those empty eyes always looking directly at me.

I tried ignoring her first. Didn't work. I tried moving out, but all my applications to State Housing were returned without any form of answer. Then, I looked throughout the whole house, looking for anything. I checked the walls for potential hollow spaces, everywhere I looked. No traces of her, whoever she is.

I want her to go away. She scares me. Looking at her fills me with revulsion. Something about her empty look makes me feel terrible. I've tried exorcisms too. The whole deal with sage and I don't know what herbs. It just got me high. But I got a solution now. A good one.

I stand on the balcony, she stands next to me. She still stands next to me as I climb onto the edge, balancing myself. A final look at her and I throw myself forward, plunging through the cold night air.

I tumble. I hear a loud crash, but from far away, as if I'm not there. I feel my body, broken beyond repair, entwined with the carcass of the car I fell on. 

Two men in dark jackets in front of me and she stands between them. But her face is not empty anymore. She is smiling now.

Clearly, as if I'm still alive and well, I hear the two men speak. ""Damn. Nice car gone to waste on murderous scum. Euthanise 'em, I say.""
""That's what we do, innit? They all off themselves, eventually. Serves this one right. Chopped up an old lady, I heard.""
""Still. The car.""
""Whatever, man. Just check if the Implant is still intact.""
The other man leans in. He whistles. ""It's good."" A few movements and he leans back, a small device in his hands. She is gone. 
""Can put this on the next scum."" He says. 

They walk away. The last I hear is:
""Do these things actually project actual spirits or is it just a gimmick?""
""Frankly, I have no idea."""

I drove my forearm deeper into his throat. The boy cowered in the corner. My mind felt aflame.

&#x200B;

“Do it Jonathan. There is no place in this world for men like him. Force him to us. He will see punishment,” cooed the voices in my head. My vision reddened. I felt blood dripping down my face, the small horn protruding from my head pushing itself further out. I gasped and my grip loosened. The priest began wiggling out from under my grasp and the boy shrieked. Regaining my senses, I slammed him hard onto the wooden flooring of the church, knocking the wind out of him and wrapping my hands around his throat.

&#x200B;

“You won’t be forgiven for this Jonathan. God will judge you. He will bring fury down on you,” wheezed the priest, struggling to breathe as I tightened my grip on him. I felt the boy slink closer to me. He stood over my shoulder, panting. I felt my canines elongate and my tongue split like a serpent’s. 

&#x200B;

“This man is a false prophet Jonathan. He speaks of being holy but his actions speak otherwise. A grown man violating the innocence of children. He does not belong in this world,” the voices were almost deafening inside my head. The priest’s face contorted, purple from lack of oxygen. My skin felt like it was being singed off.

&#x200B;

“Do it Mr. Phillip,” the boy whispered in my ear. Removing my hands from around the priest’s throat, I brought my fists down repeatedly on the priest’s chest. I felt his chest cave in as he sprayed blood onto myself and the boy with every blow. Blood painted the boy’s and I’s face an odd shade of crimson. I brought my fists down together one last time and straddled him, panting. 

&#x200B;

“Come now Mr. Phillip,” the boy whispered and helped me up to my feet. My hands had become unusually large. It felt odd in the boy’s tiny hand. I snorted animalistically, trudging down the aisle, the sounds of my hoofed legs echoing off the church’s walls. 

&#x200B;

“He was a bad man.” I gave a toothy grin."

As he gets out of bed he hears a child laughing in the distance, ""Who's there ?"" he says nervously. But as he approaches the bedroom door the laughter fades away. Shaking and scared now Donus heads to the kitchen where the loud noise was heard. Now downstairs he slowly approaches the kitchen and sitting facing the wall is a child. ""Hey!.... Hey!"" Donus says as he steps closer, and once he touches the child he disappears and laughter can be heard as the Thunder rumbles the house. The Ghost only he sees. "
9qguxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9qguxt/ambrosia/,Ambrosia,632,35,1540234879.0," This town is not like the one you and I grew up in.

There are armed patrols around the perimeter. Walls to keep us in. One-hundred foot tall ‘observance’ towers to keep things in check, to keep the conveyor belts moving.

At first they told us it was a study. That it was a government-funded five-year program and when it was done we’d go home. But that was twenty years ago. 

At least I think it was. All the TVs do here is play repeats of old movies. The internet clone we are allowed to use is frozen in 2018 and doesn’t actually connect to anything. No one seems to know why. No one asks. 

Over time, the truth has filtered down.

We are part of a private enterprise, funded by a famous billionaire, backed by the government and military complex to discover the possibility of human regeneration. By that, I mean immortality. Defeating death. 

We have been ‘sold’ by the state to the private entity and our records have been removed from the outside world. We don’t exist. We never have. And our only utility is “the work”.

What is “the work”?

Reproduction. An endless supply of babies that are then sent to the ‘big house’, for processing and harvest. 

It’s the blood they want, you see. They believe infant blood can reverse the effects of ageing - at least for those with the means to pay for it.

As a physically fit man and classified “skilled worker” in this town I have fathered forty-seven healthy babies. Not one have I held in my arms. The mothers, each of them, go insane with grief in time and are “vanished”. I have learned to not get too attached. 

Once or twice a year they bring new recruits from the outside. Young women with no families or ties that can be paired off and used for the next wave of units. They’re fed the old “study” routine, promised a large cheque, and we’re forbidden from telling them the truth. That is, unless we want to disappear too. 

My forty-eighth “wife” has just given birth to a beautiful, healthy girl. She is six pounds eight ounces, with a strong grip. She has my mother’s smile. 

My wife is crying with happiness and exhaustion, her dark hair streaked across her face. She holds the baby out to me but I refuse. 

I’m waiting for the knock on the door. "

I now know what is beyond the gate of death and it isn’t unpleasant. I find it difficult to describe but you are treated quite well, the food is near ambrosia and there is always the sound of angel’s humming in the background. I have yet to have seen an angel in this ethereal realm but I believe it is for a reason why I haven’t witnessed one.

I’m not quite sure if it is heaven but I know it’s paradise. I am not alone in this dimension as people my age are with me, I died when I was in my prime, I did find it particularly strange that most of them were within five years of me and no other age groups were accompanying us in this near endless dimension. My companions were in the millions, possibly billions and all lived in harmony in the golden clouds.

The realm was superior to my life on Earth everyday. The hum of the angels, the scent of the aerospace, the cleanliness of the air, the mind blowing beauty of the golden city that could never be put into words, it all collided onto my senses and gave an experience greater than any drug.

My experience in this realm was greater than any before and I was happy to stay here for the rest of forever. This all changed when I realised soldiers were given special treatment before they would be sent into a battle that would surely kill them.

 The medium raised her hands to heaven as she cried out.  The doors slammed, the shutters banged.  Pictures fell from the walls as the lights exploded, one after another.  The Jones family covered their eyes and ears, waiting for the end—and then it was over. 

The house was deathly quiet.  It was a full minute before Mr. Jones dared to look. “Is it over at last?” 

The medium nodded.  “The evil spirit has been purged.  Your home is cleansed.” 

The family embraced one another with joy and relief.  Six months of hell, particularly for little Suzie—first their doubt about the voice she claimed to hear, then visits to skeptical head doctors, and finally unavoidable belief coupled with the anxiety of powerlessness against an otherworldly force—were finally behind them.  Whatever had tormented them from the realm beyond was gone. 

Breakfast the next morning was enjoyable for the first time in as far as any of them could remember.  The parents joked and flirted while the children laughed and tossed morsels of food across the table.  At last, they were free. 

Only little Suzie remained silent, staring into her bowl of Alpha-bits as the letters floated around of their own accord. 

*DID U LIK TH SHOW LAST NITE* 

Her lip quivered as they shifted again. 

*NOW WE CAN HAV SOM FUN* 

A tear fell from her eye and splashed silently into the milk. 

*I START WTH UR MOM.* 

Suzie looked up helplessly as her mother laughed, blissfully unaware of the butcher knife on the counter slowly rotating to point directly at her back. "

Earthquakes are not the result of tectonic plates grinding against each other. They are not a natural phenomena. Not by a long shot. 

We've been lied to by the scientific community for centuries, fed a manufactured explanation that was conceived in blind panic. And fear. The government, the *world governments*, have kept the truth behind these geographical disturbances hidden from the public for fear of its response. Not that they want to keep it a secret. 

They just don't want the public to slip into that dreaded yet blissful insanity our ancestors were suffering from. They know that if the hideous truth is revealed, then we'd go mad from the implications or riot against them. We'd question the people in charge and seek to escape. 

And what is this truth? 

The Earth doesn't have a core. It doesn't have a center filled with superheated molten rock, it is hollow. And there's something inside. 

Something alive. 

Something that has tentacles. 

Tentacles that poke through. "
