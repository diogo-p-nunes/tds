Piece of advice, just say ""sex"".",t3_9ub1ia
e931noz,t1_e9316vx,Yes.. Is it that bad?,t3_9ub1ia
e97yq1a,t1_e95rv48,"It wasn't allowing me to post the story for 10 minutes. I changed that part of the story because I assumed that was an issue. Either way, the story isn't great but anyone with half a brain can translate xxx to sex. So it's no big deal to me. I think I have to work on how I write my stories more so, then the choice of words I use.",t3_9ub1ia
e931tet,t1_e931noz,"I was just curious! I noticed some POV and tense changes throughout that kinda confused me and I wasn’t sure who Scott was at first. I think the story itself isn’t bad, but maybe work on setting a creepier atmosphere, more fluent dialogue, and just ending it with the killer saying “she wants you to be with her” and implying the gunshot could have been a bit spookier. A cliche cliffhanger can do wonders! Good luck on your writing journey, keep going hard!",t3_9ub1ia

e9333sl,t1_e931tet,"This is my first story here. Have done a little writing before but nothing consistent. This an escape for me.

Thanks for the good advice. I know I was a little sloppy. It just helps with the stress of life.",t3_9ub1ia
e933as2,t1_e9337hl,"Do you own that phone number? If not, change it ***now***.",t3_9ub1ia
e9339cb,t1_e9333sl,"No worries at all! I 100% understand, it’s a great escape. Do it cause you love it man, I’m pretty new myself so I’m not here to criticize and be “that guy”. Enjoy what you’re doing, work hard at it, and others will see that. Have a great one man, keep on writing!",t3_9ub1ia
