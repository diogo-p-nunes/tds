e9aei9y,t3_9v86at,So... The scary part... Is that there's nothing to be scared of... ?,t3_9v86at
e9atehz,t3_9v86at,Thought this was going to be a r/TwoSentenceHorror in which the person discovers they‚Äôd gotten the ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù out of an urn.,t3_9v86at
e9kzyqc,t3_9v86at,"I did like this story (I made sure to upvote). I would personally get rid of the line about the character regretting leaving their job. I feel like it doesn‚Äôt add anything; and if anything, makes the reader wonder why they even quit their ‚Äújob‚Äù. But, still, good job (:",t3_9v86at
e9a4d5c,t3_9v86at,"Hi all, please let me know points for improvement. I'm still in the nascent stage and am experimenting with my writing.

Thank you! ",t3_9v86at
e9b5b7v,t3_9v86at,Thank you all for your votes - up or down. Just a request : please let me know especially if you have down voted and the reasons for it. I want to improve. ,t3_9v86at
e9aeolq,t1_e9aei9y,"Oh, there's nothing scary as such - just a mercenary/serial killer who had hung up her boots will start killing again because she thinks everything is going good out there. 

Since there's only positivity, she doesn't have stories to tell to this sub anymore. 

Sorry if it was very subtle. Maybe I should add more. Please let me know if you have any suggestion to make the ending clearer.

e9b0xzy,t1_e9atehz,"Haha, it didn't even strike me!

I just wanted to write some thing dark but positive ",t3_9v86at
e9m5t7i,t1_e9kzyqc,Thank you üòä your feedback means a lot to me. I have thought of rewriting this story after few days with a fresh mind. I'll incorporate yours and one more kind reader's (from another sub) input in that story and post. Hopefully it will come out neater. ,t3_9v86at
e9aeuqu,t1_e9aeolq,"The statement ""make a killing"" was a good hint, but that's really all there is.  I was imaging that it was a stock broker with a dusty computer or something.",t3_9v86at
e9af12c,t1_e9aeuqu,"Haha, I was going for the granny / homemaker image in my mind. But this works too! 

Thanks for the feedback! It all looks solid in my mind, but I get to know the loopholes when I get feedback like this! ",t3_9v86at
e9af95m,t1_e9aeuqu,"I have changed, 'equipment', to, 'guns and knives'. Hope it's fine ",t3_9v86at
