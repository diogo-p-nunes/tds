e9uevi5,t1_e9ud4by,"Spring-heeled Jack, took me longer than I'd like to admit. Very good. I like it more now.",t3_9wvbxa
e9uga9o,t1_e9uevi5,"Haha no worries. He's a bit obscure. But I thought he seemed to embody a lot of the same qualities that dragons did in older myths - that's my personal theory on why he captured the victorian imagination - he provided an outlet for everything about human nature (uninhibited, lustful etc) that they'd tried so hard to suppress. Just like dragons seem to have done for older societies (e.g. Greed. Given that dragons aren't known for being big spenders, they're very keen on acquiring gold) ",t3_9wvbxa
