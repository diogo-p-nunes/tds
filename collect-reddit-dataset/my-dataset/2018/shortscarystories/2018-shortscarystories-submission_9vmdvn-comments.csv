e9e5hqv,t3_9vmdvn,"Agree with the previous comment. This is a great concept and the post is written really well, but it's tough to condense it down to 500 words.
Enjoyed it though - the basic concept I took from it was the notion that the philosopher who gains insight into the universe uncovers more than he intends. That idea really worked for me",t3_9vmdvn
e9dyue4,t3_9vmdvn,"This is really well written. I think it needs a venue where you can give it more length to do it justice, though",t3_9vmdvn

e9e9syf,t1_e9e5hqv,"Cool, thanks.  You got it.  It was playing with the Zeno paradox, infinities of space, time and such.  

I try my best to offer something a little different, if I have inspiration and time to write.  I appreciate the kind comments",t3_9vmdvn
e9e47wq,t1_e9dyue4,"Thanks, yeah.  It's easy to have an idea, and begin writing something, then miss the forest for the trees while you're editing and re-writing.  It's easy, for me anyway, to forget that it will be new to the reader, not the 100th time like it is for me.  That's a credit to all the talented people here who post such polished stories that seem to roll off the page like they wrote themselves.  It's not luck.",t3_9vmdvn
e9e51zd,t1_e9e47wq,"I think that's just a problem this subreddit causes. People struggle to reach the word count and it can really show. Some stories are meant for flash fiction; some are not. Just keep practicing. With an idea this complex, it might help to outline before really diving in",t3_9vmdvn
e9e9xfv,t1_e9e51zd,I've never even heard of outlining a story.  That's awesome.  I really appreciate your kindness and that of others on this board.  Knowing people will be understanding makes it a lot easier to stick your neck out.,t3_9vmdvn
