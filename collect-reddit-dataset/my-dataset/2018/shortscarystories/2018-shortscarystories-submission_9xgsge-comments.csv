""The Little Match Girl"" (Danish: Den Lille Pige med Svovlstikkerne, meaning ""The little girl with the matchsticks"") is a short story by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen. The story, about a dying child's dreams and hope, was first published in 1845. It has been adapted to various media, including an animated short film, a television musical, and an animated virtual reality story called ""Allumette"".
