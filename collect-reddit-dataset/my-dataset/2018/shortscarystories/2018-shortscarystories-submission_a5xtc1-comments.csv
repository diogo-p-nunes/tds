ebqexjf,t3_a5xtc1,ohmygoshthatending,t3_a5xtc1
ebqq3p9,t3_a5xtc1,I did NOT see that coming. That made me uncomfortable very quickly! Well done!! That’s  the kind of short scary story I lurk this sub for!!,t3_a5xtc1
ebqgnec,t3_a5xtc1,"THAT WAS HORRIFIC.

Well done 😁",t3_a5xtc1
ebquka7,t3_a5xtc1,I am blown away. EDIT: Now im scared to sleep,t3_a5xtc1
ebrbfji,t3_a5xtc1,Eh. I didn't like how with the mall santa the kid asks for a Xbox one but then with the creepy guy she/he says something completely different. What a difference in wishes for a Xmas gift. If she/he really wanted to hold her/his brother I feel like it would've been the first thing that came to her/his mind the first time she was asked not the Xbox? Idk how to explain but it erked me. But other than that I fucking loved it!,t3_a5xtc1
ebr66af,t3_a5xtc1,"Well, I love having nightmares. ",t3_a5xtc1

ebrit7e,t3_a5xtc1,Can someone explain the ending? Sorry im dumb,t3_a5xtc1
ebrjwc9,t3_a5xtc1,...well that escalated quickly.,t3_a5xtc1
ebrm0mr,t3_a5xtc1,Didn‘t see that one coming...well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,t3_a5xtc1
ebrquj1,t3_a5xtc1,"Everything was great about this story, the only thing which gave it away was that the little was awake till 1 am. Your story almost seemed real.",t3_a5xtc1
ec3rm05,t3_a5xtc1,"Oh yeah that does make sense! Thanks!

ebqa7ch,t1_ebq9yex,"Thanks! My first time posting here, so I was hesitant but I appreciate the feedback!",t3_a5xtc1
ebqjaek,t1_ebqexjf,Pls explain. did the old man cut open the mother?,t3_a5xtc1
ebqtq66,t1_ebqq3p9,Thank you so much!,t3_a5xtc1
ebrgwma,t1_ebrbfji,"I think it’s because the kid knows that the mall Santas aren’t the real Santas, so he doesn’t ‘trust’ him with what he really wants. I can’t explain why I think this very well, but I tried.",t3_a5xtc1
ebrjzjo,t1_ebrit7e,"Kid wanted to hold his baby brother... And didn't want to wait three more months.
Guess how ""Santa"" accomplished that~",t3_a5xtc1
ebr03ub,t1_ebqa7ch,Wow!! I was patting my back for my first story. And here you are!... Simply amazing!... No one could predict the ending!!...,t3_a5xtc1
ebqjxnw,t1_ebqjaek,"from what I understand, he cut open the mother and took the baby out, she probably didn't feel or hear it though. cause ya know, it's santa.",t3_a5xtc1
ebrqmhf,t1_ebrgwma,You got it!,t3_a5xtc1
ebr052v,t1_ebr03ub,Thank you so much! :),t3_a5xtc1
