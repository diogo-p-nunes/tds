eaeoejl,t3_a04kvk,I like it but don’t get the point of mason,t3_a04kvk
eaermqq,t3_a04kvk,I like the premise but the delivery seems very clunky. Parts like Mason seemed unnecessary and the inexplicable red sky to segue into her husband being a demon seems a bit forced.,t3_a04kvk
eaeou6f,t3_a04kvk,"I liked it.  A couple of questions, why couldn't Gran hint at a bad marriage?  What was the first boyfriend about?  And I know red eyes are associated with demons but was the husband really a bad guy? 

Good read nonetheless ",t3_a04kvk
eaemwjz,t3_a04kvk,Grandma’s kind of a dick.,t3_a04kvk
eaerx7x,t3_a04kvk,"Good read, but it’s a little too similar to AHS Apocalypse to be considered really original.",t3_a04kvk
eaepp7f,t1_eaeoejl,Mason just goes to show that Misty's fate is sealed. She wanted to marry him but he dies so she can meet Brandon ,t3_a04kvk
eaf6pb3,t1_eaermqq,I agree with all you wrote,t3_a04kvk
eaepxv2,t1_eaeou6f,"The husband is implied to be a demon. He's charming enough but at his core he is still evil and now she's carrying his spawn. Her grandma foresaw this fate but as we see with Mason's untimely death, her fate was sealed as she was always meant to meet and marry him and have his baby.",t3_a04kvk
