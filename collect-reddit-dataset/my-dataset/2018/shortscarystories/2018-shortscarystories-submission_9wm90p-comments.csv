e9mkgbo,t3_9wm90p,"Concept is cool, but for the amount of upvotes it got for being written pretty poorly, it kind of puts a lot of the other amazingly written stories here to shame. ",t3_9wm90p

e9n01gl,t3_9wm90p,"I disagree a tiny bit w others. I like the staccato way it flows, it makes me think of a child being told a sort of fable type story by a grandmother or something.  The grammar bothered me yes, but I think the staccato is better, just needs to be more focused on if that makes sense. Instead of short sentences and then long, maybe more should be shorter, no run ons. 

Not sure if I expressed that clearly lol",t3_9wm90p
e9nf9vs,t3_9wm90p,loved this! well done ,t3_9wm90p

e9mlyom,t1_e9mkgbo,"Was just thinking the same thing. It’s not just the grammar, it’s the whole flow of the story",t3_9wm90p

edj0ovt,t1_e9mlyom,Can you explain a bit?,t3_9wm90p
e9m19pd,t1_e9lys1q,Lol I thought this was sarcasm but then you did it ,t3_9wm90p
e9lytoh,t1_e9lys1q,"Thanks, actually I am having a page on Instagram @boogy.boo Please check it out. ",t3_9wm90p
edj4uwv,t1_edj0ovt,Most of the sentences are really simple. I’d consider including more complex and compound sentences instead of breaking them up. Fir example a sentence that just says “he felt sad” isn’t really necessary and interrupts the flow a lot. Plus there are a lot of grammatical errors and places where letters were just left off so I think you should consider reading it over again.,t3_9wm90p
edj4xzq,t1_edj0ovt,Also you said the character’s name like 8 times when you could’ve just combined the sentences or used “he” instead,t3_9wm90p

edj5d5f,t1_edj4xzq,Thanks alot I am kinda new at it.  Reddit is actually great! I will keep those points in mind when I write a new story... Also you can check my other stories at insta/boogy.boo,t3_9wm90p
e9mauwo,t1_e9lzhy4,Thanks! OP's concept was great but reading it made my brain hurt a bit.,t3_9wm90p
e9mw6hk,t1_e9lzhy4,"Better, but a bit too staccato to me. A lot of short sentences that could be combined. And you could still loose a ""tree"" here and there. Like:

""He felt a little sad but then he looked through the window facing the backyard.   There was a birch tree outside and something about it made him feel uncomfortable.  The moonlight made it glow and fog covered it as if protecting it.  Ross noticed there were only three leaves, the rest of the tree seemed lifeless.""

Etcetera. ",t3_9wm90p
