e8e29iz,t3_9r3asn,"Kinda reminds me of the story from the cold war of the Russian soldier who got a false warning that the US had fired missiles, but didn't fire back since he figured it was a false alarm.",t3_9r3asn
e8ed1oe,t3_9r3asn,"Its horror because it might... never happen. If Russia fire at us we're all going down the pan.

But beautifully done. Manifique. ",t3_9r3asn
e8ekkqk,t3_9r3asn,Thank you for all the love guys. This is my first post :),t3_9r3asn
e8fnqch,t3_9r3asn,"A strange game.  
The only winning move is not to play.",t3_9r3asn
e8edlcv,t3_9r3asn,"Simple but effective, OP. Kind of reminds me of 'The Outer Limits' ep ['Dead Man's Switch.'](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x61kukx)",t3_9r3asn
e8eq21a,t3_9r3asn,I got a good laugh from the introduction. ,t3_9r3asn
e8fqz0q,t3_9r3asn,This was a great read. You were very concise with your wording and still made it believable and scary.,t3_9r3asn
e8emk8v,t3_9r3asn,I’ve always wondered how much a job like that pays. ,t3_9r3asn
e8fq4ii,t3_9r3asn,"wow... crisp and a solid story,  it's interesting that even though we get the consequences of pressing that ""BUTTON"", our leaders don't.. :(",t3_9r3asn
e8pg19f,t3_9r3asn,This is great! Love it! ,t3_9r3asn
e8ghue8,t3_9r3asn,"By the end I knew exactly what this story was about, without you ever stating it directly.  That's good writing.  Not too much exposition, not so little that it was confusing.",t3_9r3asn
e8evgg1,t3_9r3asn,"Honestly this is why I don’t understand the point of MAD. Eventually, it comes down to “do we let ALL of humanity die in a fiery blast, or only most of it?”  I get that the point of a retaliatory strike would be to disable any further missile launches, but with the stockpile both forces had during the Cold War a nuclear exchange would have almost certainly ended humanity. ",t3_9r3asn
e8f91qx,t3_9r3asn,Beautiful..,t3_9r3asn
e9on1gb,t3_9r3asn,Except.....it's not just pushing one button...and it's not a soldier that would be doing it. I served on a US SSBN for four years and got familiar with our mission (Nuclear deterrence). Takes a lot of people to launch. ,t3_9r3asn
e8ej4ki,t3_9r3asn,Horrify me huh......,t3_9r3asn

Love reading about this over and over. Simply an amazing feat of human will, intelligence, and competence. ",t3_9r3asn
e8ef6a5,t1_e8e29iz,I was thinking of exactly this while reading!,t3_9r3asn
e8er10c,t1_e8e29iz,Also Vasili Arkhipov,t3_9r3asn
e8emovl,t1_e8ekkqk,Loved the story. Great job! ,t3_9r3asn
e8fpv7g,t1_e8fnqch,What is this from again? My friend told me about the movie a while back but never got them chance to watch it and now I forgot the name,t3_9r3asn
e8fllvy,t1_e8eq21a,"I know, that's the intended build up :)",t3_9r3asn
e8ezp7o,t1_e8evgg1,"The point of MAD is to make the enemy believe that you'd be willing to retaliate even if it meant killing every single one of them or every other person on earth. At that point any nation wouldn't want to make a first strike since they would be pressing the button on themselves.

Israel for example is a tiny tiny country in a speck of desert, but they have nuclear weapons trained on major cities across the globe. If a country like the US doesnt aid them and let's them fall, they employ MAD",t3_9r3asn
ea256xj,t1_e9on1gb,The US isn't the only country with nuclear weapons. The UK's submarine warheads being fired is purely on the head of the guy in charge of the submarine. If the submarine surfaces and the world has ended then he's ultimately the one who decides if they fire back or not,t3_9r3asn
e8e9nh2,t1_e8e9n7e,"**Stanislav Petrov**

Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov (Russian: Станисла́в Евгра́фович Петро́в; 7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who became known as ""the man who single-handedly saved the world from nuclear war"" for his role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident. 

On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm, and his decision to disobey orders, against Soviet military protocol, is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in large-scale nuclear war. Investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned.
