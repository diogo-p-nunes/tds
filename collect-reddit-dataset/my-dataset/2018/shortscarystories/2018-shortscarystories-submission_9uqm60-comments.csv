Zeno’s white toga, containing a myriad universes, shifts and sways with his torso as he walks.

Five steps he takes; five eternities.

‘My Gods, how long have I been gone?’.

Scanning the forest around him, he takes in some notched vines, creaking overhead with the gentle breeze.  They rock; two eons back, two eons forth.  Glancing down at the red fresh apples he’d left home to pick, his foot churns through earth, opening great chasms.

‘If only they knew of the infinities we hold within us.  All my friends; everyone.  But even if I told them, could they understand?’

‘With the power of a million galaxies I can strike down my enemy.  With the touch of the tiniest creation I can caress my baby’s cheek.  My little Eudora.’  He picks up an apple; brown and withered now; filled with soft squirming life, and releases it to the ground.  ‘Yes, I’ll give her a kiss.  That’s what I’ll do… when I get home.’

Unbeknownst to Zeno, the apple remains, suspended in air; caught in a sun’s ray like the summoning light of the Gods.

‘Halfway there again...any time now’,

Zeno checks the sun. ‘The house should be in sight.’

But passing a familiar bend he finds himself entering a foreign land. Great stone towers taller than even the pyramids, and iron carts that move on their own.  Innumerable people, more than Zeno has seen in the largest battles, walk there and here.  They wear such rare and colorful garments.

‘What is this!’ Zeno gasps . Dear Hermes, is this a curse? Zeus... Hera, a mirage?  Surely this is a trick.  Where is my home, my darling Arista?  My sweet Eudora?  Where am I?’

He turns around to search for the forest from which he emerged, but sees only more of the flat landscape of rock and strange flashing lights, going on seemingly forever.

Zeno’s legs give out as he drops toward the earth. A wail as immense as the cosmos lets out.  People gibbering in a strange language seem alarmed and huddle around him, remarking and pointing curiously.",t3_9uqm60
