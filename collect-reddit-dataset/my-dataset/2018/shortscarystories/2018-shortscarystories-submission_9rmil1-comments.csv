My idea was that the mirror shows opposite worlds. Bedroom was blue, but now it's red. It was day, now it's night. So if the reflection is alive but everyone else is dead, that means the narrator died on her respective side and became a ghost and passed through the mirror, while her whole family is still alive

e8iewyp,t1_e8idoi2,"I think the reflection took her family one by one and killed them. I think, I'm not entirely sure either.",t3_9rmil1
