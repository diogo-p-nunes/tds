earrbby,t3_a1kk0h,"I appreciate the feedback so far, very inspiring to write another story soon. I've had this story in my mind for a few years now - Not sure if it was planted by Twilight Zone / Tales from the Crypt or somewhere, but I do remember it hitting one day while I was out walking. It feels good to have finally posted a story after reading hundreds (or more) here.",t3_a1kk0h

easixk3,t3_a1kk0h,"I‚Äôm struggling not to laugh at the cheerful ‚ÄúWhat a catch!‚Äù at the end. That completely caught me off guard, well done.",t3_a1kk0h

eart6m3,t3_a1kk0h,"I definitely thought Peter was going to be the bad guy in this so I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. It was a pleasant short story to read, I really hope you write more",t3_a1kk0h

earhxaa,t3_a1kk0h,This was sick. Bravo!,t3_a1kk0h
earpdj3,t3_a1kk0h,"I remember seeing this on tv years ago. Twilight Zone or Night Gallery or one of those shows. I wondered then and now why he didn't just cut the line. Fishermen always have knives on them. Anyways, good story. ",t3_a1kk0h

ear4i3s,t1_ear115g,this was so well written I loved it! keep writing bro,t3_a1kk0h
earc6yy,t1_ear115g,It‚Äôs really original! Good work! ,t3_a1kk0h
earw7lo,t1_ear115g,"My only criticism is the ending, loses the tone of the rest of the story. The very last phrase is great though. Great imagery, fantastic storytelling. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I normally am wary of any stories on this sub, figuring its short enough so I may as well, only to find that it isn't all that great. But the build up of this is pretty fantastic. Like a horror movie, beginning happy and/or serene only to end in suffering. Just something about that last line, maybe the change in tone was intentional. Snapping you out of the peace ... Not sure, it just seems sort of off.",t3_a1kk0h
eargsus,t1_earfnnh,Would you rather drink your beer warm? *Gag* No thanks. ,t3_a1kk0h

eass9cw,t1_earw7lo,"I appreciated the thoughtful feedback, I do need to focus on the ending - one of the most important pieces of any story.",t3_a1kk0h
eargual,t1_eargsus,Lol sorry I have brain ass I was thinking cold brew coffee :p,t3_a1kk0h
earsiw2,t1_eargsus,"Depends on the beer. Some actually taste better when warmed up, or at least not icy cold.

For me, I like my brews cold in the summer and warm in the winter.",t3_a1kk0h
earr87g,t1_earmemn,"That was a good read, I haven't seen it before but of a similar vein.",t3_a1kk0h
earh8ug,t1_eargual,I love cold brew! But then again I like my coffee to taste like coffee even when I‚Äôve put in creamer. To each their own (non/)caffeinated beverage of choice!,t3_a1kk0h
