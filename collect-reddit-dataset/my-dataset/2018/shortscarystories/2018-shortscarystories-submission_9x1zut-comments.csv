e9psai9,t3_9x1zut,Damn I didn’t think this subreddit could ever make me cry and ponder so much at the same time. I read the comments and then the story again and holy shit amazing job. ,t3_9x1zut
e9pcilw,t3_9x1zut,Wonderful subtlety ,t3_9x1zut
e9prq9b,t3_9x1zut,"the initial story is great, but when I got into the subtext then that was jucy.",t3_9x1zut

e9qgd0l,t3_9x1zut,"The metaphor lacked subtlety, therefore, the story was completely predictable. Also, I suggest you work on your grammar, and I mean it in a good way. English isn't my first language, but I worked hard every day to polish my technique. I'm mentioning this so that nobody thinks I'm trying to discriminate or something like that. The creatures were original, and their nickname is super catchy, so points for creativity.",t3_9x1zut

ea0kak6,t1_e9qgd0l,I think the downvotes you're getting are because you claim that the metaphor lacked subtlety. Most people can agree it wasn't immediately obvious. ,t3_9x1zut
e9siqhf,t1_e9qgd0l,Are there specific instances of incorrect grammar in the story? I personally couldn't find one.,t3_9x1zut

e9u21tk,t1_e9siqhf,"As a native English speaker, grammar is whatever I be saying it is.

And I was raised with a very chillaxed dialect of English.",t3_9x1zut
e9pftem,t1_e9pfn09,"Ok, what's so wonderfully subtle?",t3_9x1zut
e9pg5gg,t1_e9pftem,"It depends on whether you picked up the subtext- if you did, then you might be confused about why a blatant metaphor is considered subtle; if you did not, you might be wondering what the hell I'm talking about.

Aliens are european colonizers in North America. Humans are native Americans.",t3_9x1zut
e9pg8wd,t1_e9pg5gg,Ooh! Thanks!,t3_9x1zut
