ebsmey6,t3_a66jhy,Please send this to my uni. We actually have some of what you wrote going on.,t3_a66jhy
ebuaolf,t3_a66jhy,"I know this story is obviously more on the eerie side but my alma mater also had some concerning views on suicidal ideation:

ebsjzaq,t3_a66jhy,Fantastic.  I absolutely believe this is a viewpoint held by some deans.,t3_a66jhy
ebtnmoe,t3_a66jhy,Georgia tech? This really struck a chord with me. You really captured the underlying tone of emails like this well,t3_a66jhy
ebsfch6,t3_a66jhy,Yikes,t3_a66jhy
ebwh2v0,t3_a66jhy,The best part is that there barely is a sympathetic tone between words and sentences.,t3_a66jhy
ec0zquq,t3_a66jhy,"The third paragraph made me feel a rise in my blood pressure. Such a disturbing, great story. ",t3_a66jhy

ebssrl7,t1_ebsp23g,"The horror is slowly building through little details - can you imagine if you got a note from your dean condemning suicide because of how it looks for the university? A bridge being off limits at night because of the frequency of suicides and difficulty retrieving the bodies? Then there's the added malice of possible attackers in the park.

I think the name is just to add a sense of realism. ",t3_a66jhy
ebtnaul,t1_ebsp23g,"I think the line near the end where it said “let his death be a lesson to you all” kind of implies that he was punished for not working hard. I may be wrong, but that was how I saw it.",t3_a66jhy
ebt39fx,t1_ebsegek,Where have I read that?...,t3_a66jhy
ebuqblb,t1_ebuaolf,That's ridiculous.,t3_a66jhy
ebsw0ch,t1_ebssrl7,"Jesus. Beautifully crafted, and you really did add a sense of realism, because university students who are struggling have a high suicide rate. Great story now that I really understand.",t3_a66jhy
ebtce1c,t1_ebssrl7,"> can you imagine if you got a note from your dean condemning suicide because of how it looks for the university?

Honestly, that level of lack of sympathy should be reserved for the business world!",t3_a66jhy
ebto4s4,t1_ebtnaul,"Ohhh shit. That’s a really good thought. That does have an insanely sinister tone to it, like they have been killing off students who have not worked hard enough and covering them up as suicides. Smart dude right here.",t3_a66jhy
ebtskib,t1_ebt39fx,“Knowledge is power.”,t3_a66jhy
ebszp2w,t1_ebsw0ch,"Thxs.
Also, can confirm this is based off recent events surrounding my university. Unfortunately, it is an unusually common thing.",t3_a66jhy
ebsyziw,t1_ebsw0ch,"Not my story, but I agree with you!!",t3_a66jhy
ebt052p,t1_ebszp2w,"Omg that’s horrible. Did the dean send an email and you thought you could twist it into a scary story? If so, that’s smart.",t3_a66jhy
ebwomtd,t1_ebszp2w,"Ooof, I know that feel though. My high school is basically a hive of the suicidal and/or mentally ill, myself included. Only in my class, three people have attempted to commit suicide (myself included), 2 suffer from anorexia (one of them being the one that tried to commit suicide), 3 from severe social anxiety which makes some of them self-harm (+ me), and at least 3 other are diagnosed with depression.",t3_a66jhy
ebt0130,t1_ebsyziw,"Sorry I keep doing that, new to reddit",t3_a66jhy
ebt0ioz,t1_ebt052p,"Yes, we had emails sent out following a very recent - past few weeks - and tragic incident.

When I first started here, a lot of the history was swept under the rug though. There were several talks on 'mental health', yet without the actual suicides in question ever once being mentioned. It made me think how incredibly two-faced they apppeared.

Edit: I'd prefer not to say which university, for those asking. Don't want to give away personal details and all that.",t3_a66jhy
ebt6clw,t1_ebt0ioz,So do you by chance go to Georgia Tech? This story and your comments bear an eerie resemblance to recent events on campus. ,t3_a66jhy
ebt3hoi,t1_ebt0ioz,"Wow. That’s horrible, I hope to god nothings happened since. Nonetheless, way to use something that could actually happen and turn it into horror, the scariest stories are those which are realistic.",t3_a66jhy
ebti62d,t1_ebt0ioz,think the true scary story would be to just copy paste the email here (with redactions of course).,t3_a66jhy
ebtwx63,t1_ebt6clw,"Correct me if I'm wrong /u/SlaterTC1, but it's the University of Bristol, isn't it? ",t3_a66jhy
