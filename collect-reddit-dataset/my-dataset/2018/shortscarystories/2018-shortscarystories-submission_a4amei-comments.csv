ebdoii8,t1_ebcu5sq,Way better than this story,t3_a4amei
ebd1zd2,t1_ebcwlis,That's a really interesting interpretation of what  I wrote.  I didn't realize it could be seen as a mad scientist  story. ,t3_a4amei
ebe7yzz,t1_ebdfxf7,Is there any other way to interpret it? :P,t3_a4amei

ebethbo,t1_ebe7yzz,"The wife was pregnant when she was killed. The creature/maybe it's just a psychotic killer immitates a child to torment OP. 

I mean there's only one way of interpreting it. Just trying to be devil's advocate. ",t3_a4amei
ebef45a,t1_ebdsdyk,"I get that, but saying ""Call the cops"" would be more ambiguous and effective. People call the cops for all sorts of things, including animal and child abuse.

EDIT: Also the line ""Try to lock me up"" would do well in it's place.",t3_a4amei
ebdsn9n,t1_ebdsdyk,It’s not very subtle and I think the story would work better without it.,t3_a4amei
