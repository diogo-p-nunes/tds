ea73yaa,t3_9yvvgb,this story started off great but it kinda gets messed up with switching from past tense to present. I also think ending it on 'without a trace' would've been effective or just rewording the last line. Just a bit of constructive criticism but I liked the overall story :),t3_9yvvgb

ea9mwt8,t1_ea98mlp,"That's kinda what I've done with my story (lmao self promoting I'm sorry XD). I wrote it for fun when me and my sister were bored, we tried writing a short scary story in ten minutes and I posted the result ",t3_9yvvgb
