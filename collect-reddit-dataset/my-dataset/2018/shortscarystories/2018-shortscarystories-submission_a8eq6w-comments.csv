ecan9uz,t3_a8eq6w,"Great read! Decent set-up and if it weren‚Äôt for the character limit I think this could even go on for a bit longer, establish this ‚Äútic toc‚Äù thing a bit more. Fantastically written though",t3_a8eq6w
ecaowt8,t3_a8eq6w,my TikTok started updating while i was reading this,t3_a8eq6w
ecby6p2,t3_a8eq6w,Poor autistic kid...born with Shinigami eyes. Good thing he didn't go nuts like Beyond in that book...,t3_a8eq6w
eca7acg,t3_a8eq6w,Seen this concept before ,t3_a8eq6w
ecap0bd,t1_ecaowt8,I haven't touched it since I put it up. ,t3_a8eq6w
ecbyry9,t1_ecby6p2,What book is that pal ,t3_a8eq6w
ecbzbfd,t1_ecby6p2,"The idea actually comes from Game of Thrones and  the origins of Holddor. Now that was story telling, it made me cry seriously lol.",t3_a8eq6w
eca7lae,t1_eca7acg,I'm fairly new here and  I'm sure it happens. I try my best to be original.  probably won't be the first time I write something that's been done to death.,t3_a8eq6w
ecap1hb,t1_ecap0bd,I'll even show you the original ,t3_a8eq6w
ecbyznh,t1_ecbyry9,"Death Note. The LA BB Murder Cases. It comes from the manga/anime Death Note originally, though.",t3_a8eq6w
ecc17kt,t1_ecbzbfd,Hodor? Hodor Hodor! HODOR! ,t3_a8eq6w
eca7t18,t1_eca7lae,"Never mind, it was your story on the two sentence one üòÇüòÇ",t3_a8eq6w
ecbz3rf,t1_ecbyznh,I must give this Death note a look. Actually sounds like my cup of tea. ,t3_a8eq6w
eca7xpn,t1_eca7t18,lol But look it does happen though to be fair.,t3_a8eq6w
ecc1c1z,t1_ecbz3rf,"If you like cat and mouse detective stories with a supernatural twist, then yes, it's perfect. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the main character is SO intelligent that he manages to trick a death god into killing herself. It's a truly amazing anime/manga. The manga is a lot more involved, but the anime does a good job covering the plot fairly well. It just doesn't get as deep into the characters thoughts and emotions as the manga and two novels do.",t3_a8eq6w
ecc1end,t1_ecc1c1z,cheers pal definitely going to check it out. ,t3_a8eq6w
