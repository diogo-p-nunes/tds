e9li72l,t3_9whqt1,Can someone explain what is happening? :),t3_9whqt1
e9lm5i9,t3_9whqt1,It reminds me of an *Interstellar* or *The Road* type apocalypse. Vivid mental pictures. Well done.,t3_9whqt1
e9lyebn,t3_9whqt1,18th of january. Thats gonna be a hell of a birthday for me,t3_9whqt1
e9m1vao,t3_9whqt1,Horror with a little sci fi is always good.,t3_9whqt1
e9livqv,t1_e9li72l,The kid knows when the sun is gonna explode and end the world. His parents are gonna go on a last vacation or something before then,t3_9whqt1
e9m3n5a,t1_e9lyebn,"Wow, same here ",t3_9whqt1
e9thnr3,t1_e9livqv,"I see it as nothing to do with the kid; the world OP lives in already knows of the impending doom from an explosive sun, that's why the doctor reminded them that abortion was ok (most parents may not want to raise a child knowing they will die) and why the school system is shutting down. (no one is bothered with learning because everyone's about to die).   
  But even despite all this, OP is glad to have his son with him as his childish innocence protects him from the horrors of the impending disaster.",t3_9whqt1
