ecac0g6,t3_a8fogu,Ooohhhhh.....I like this! Good job,t3_a8fogu
ecawi0a,t3_a8fogu,"As a [formerly] eating disordered person, my mind went to fucked up places when I was so thin I was delirious. I was intensely paranoid in early recovery, thinking everyone wanted to force-feed me and ‚Äúmake me fat‚Äù.
This story captures that paranoia beautifully and turns it into sweet anorexia-rage-revenge. Even the title of this post created a whirlwind of memories for me.
Bravo!",t3_a8fogu
ecaozkp,t3_a8fogu,Not sure if this is technically what you were going for but you should do stories like this with all seven deadly sins if you haven‚Äôt already!,t3_a8fogu
ecakxt0,t3_a8fogu,"Oh my god this made so uncomfortable well done, very well written",t3_a8fogu
ecb00eu,t3_a8fogu,"Oh. Oh my God.

Recovering from an eating disorder feels like being the mom, and everyone else is the daughter.

Very, VERY well written. I've never been so shocked and pulled in by a story on here before.",t3_a8fogu
ecb01wz,t3_a8fogu,"I really thought, for a minute, that the kid was going to eat the mom...lol! Great story!!",t3_a8fogu
ecbfm2p,t3_a8fogu,"Oh damn, this is amazing! I relate a lot (except for the forcefeeding my mother part lol) I had an ED for over sixteen years, and my mother always had ED tendencies, but not bad like me. She was never forced a feeding tube down her nose, and I always got so upset that I got them so many times, but she didn‚Äôt have to. Thought she was trying to make me fatter than her, which I always thought I was anyway! So grateful to have recovered from my ED two years ago and finally not be miserable, and ‚Äòfree of another kind of weight!‚Äô Great writing! üëçüèΩ",t3_a8fogu
ecabnnf,t3_a8fogu,Someone explain,t3_a8fogu
ecc7axo,t3_a8fogu,"I‚Äôm not usually one to comment, but seriously dude- Killer story. Great writing. Loved the set up. You have a lovely way with words.
One of my faves in the sub! 

Would love to read more from you :)",t3_a8fogu
ecap9bz,t3_a8fogu,This was very well written. I didn't see the twist coming at all.,t3_a8fogu
ecay8p7,t3_a8fogu,wtf man,t3_a8fogu
ecckvlg,t3_a8fogu,"Oh as someone whose mother caused my ED, I feel the shit out of this. Shit man. ",t3_a8fogu
ecaqmlp,t3_a8fogu,"This was unsettling for me, but well written! ",t3_a8fogu
ecaue12,t3_a8fogu,"Well done. This was one of the best ones I've read on here in quite a while, super dark and satisfying, thanks! ",t3_a8fogu
ecgba01,t3_a8fogu,As someone that has struggled with eating disorders this story really hit me. The mom is really those inner thoughts and it‚Äôs great to see her fought back ,t3_a8fogu
ecad4fb,t3_a8fogu,oh shit this triggered my eating disorder hella hard ,t3_a8fogu
ecabeol,t3_a8fogu,*edit: formatting,t3_a8fogu
ecd6jw2,t3_a8fogu,"brilliantly written. that was so disturbing, i loved it!! ",t3_a8fogu
ecd6nlv,t3_a8fogu,"Thoroughly disgusting, well done!",t3_a8fogu
ecfm3fz,t3_a8fogu,Holy shit this is dark,t3_a8fogu
echrq6j,t3_a8fogu,Echoing the others: this was a great story! Love your writing style.,t3_a8fogu
edhrqsf,t3_a8fogu,why ddint she choke,t3_a8fogu
eedz1ax,t3_a8fogu,"Jesus, that's dark. ",t3_a8fogu
ef5d1pc,t3_a8fogu,"I LOVE THIS. Just as someone recovering from an Ed, being able to get back at the person who started this path of behavior feels grossly.. liberating ",t3_a8fogu
ef74as5,t3_a8fogu,I'm struggling with my eating disorder currently and damn this hit home,t3_a8fogu
er4fmi4,t3_a8fogu,"Full admission: most of the times I read these stories, I picture the perpetrator as male in my mind. The second reading of this increased the probability that this is a female character. Makes one think about one's assumptions on psychopathy...",t3_a8fogu
ecativf,t3_a8fogu,Very good.,t3_a8fogu
ecavc22,t3_a8fogu,Yesssss. Bad mummy!!,t3_a8fogu
ecbtyfk,t3_a8fogu,Damn.  This creeped me out.  Well done!,t3_a8fogu
ecbemwp,t3_a8fogu,Why not just kill her instead of torturing her.,t3_a8fogu
ecac8i7,t1_ecac0g6,"Thanks, mama. ",t3_a8fogu
eccaog7,t1_ecawi0a,"The title definitely makes the list of things I will never say to my kids. (Unless they're trying to eat marbles or something, I guess.) Those are powerful words in a certain context.

Thank you for your kind words. <3",t3_a8fogu
ecaumsp,t1_ecaozkp,Seconding this suggestion,t3_a8fogu
ecc9wzz,t1_ecaozkp,"Not technically what I was going for... but it could work!

By the way, I think one of the popular writers over on r/nosleep did a ""7 deadly sins"" series fairly recently. ",t3_a8fogu
ecb8c2p,t1_ecaozkp,Omg yes ,t3_a8fogu
eccaph1,t1_ecb00eu,Thank you so much! (:,t3_a8fogu
ecc8uyj,t1_ecbfm2p,Thank you. & congratulations on your recovery <3,t3_a8fogu
ecacdbi,t1_ecabnnf,"Based off of my understanding:
The narrator was psychologically abused by her mother during childhood. The mother, who appears to have an eating disorder, possibly anorexia, would manipulate her and shame her for eating ‚Äútoo much‚Äù during dinner. 
Now that the narrator has grown up, and her mother needs a place to live, she has her down her basement and force feeds her as revenge. The mirrors and scales are to torture the mother as well, so that she can see herself gaining weight.
It‚Äôs kind of an exaggerated interpretation of something a decent number of people experience growing up when reaching for seconds with ‚Äúare you really going to eat that?‚Äù",t3_a8fogu
ecacavy,t1_ecabnnf,"if i understand correctly, the mom used to drastically underfeed her children on purpose, and her child is tormenting her by forcing her to watch herself gain weight",t3_a8fogu
eccausq,t1_ecc7axo,Thank you! I'll definitely be posting more. (:,t3_a8fogu
ecayba3,t1_ecay8p7,i upvoted but still. wtf man.,t3_a8fogu
eccavyy,t1_ecaue12,:D Thank you!,t3_a8fogu
ecaneq7,t1_ecad4fb,"Remember, bone on your plate, not on your body",t3_a8fogu
ecarx1u,t1_ecac8i7,"Oh yeah! One of the best I've read! Loved it

Edit: I also LOVE your username! ",t3_a8fogu
ecca7vy,t1_ecc9wzz,I‚Äôve read those ones and they‚Äôre amazing as well. I believe it was two writers that tag teamed the deadly sins concepts. But I‚Äôd love to read your take on them too :),t3_a8fogu
ecg89i1,t1_ecc9wzz,Mind sharing a link to one of them or the authors?,t3_a8fogu
ecad9e6,t1_ecacdbi,"Yes, exactly. Thank you for explaining.  ",t3_a8fogu
ecart4g,t1_ecacdbi,All this! Plus the mother starved her as a kid until her dad got her out. So the punishment is fitting.,t3_a8fogu
ecc9kar,t1_ecarx1u,"Aww, thanks! (:",t3_a8fogu
ecgq4n3,t1_ecg89i1,"Sure. You can find them all [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/7qi4ja/stories_organized_alphabetically/). They're the ones titled ""GLUTTONYavariceslothlustprideenvywrath"" with the deadly sin of interest in all caps.",t3_a8fogu
ecandr1,t1_ecad9e6,"The depiction is amazing. Took me a few back and forth to grasp the narration over different timelines, but once I did, man it is chilling. 

I can almost feel the broken, jagged psyche of the protagonist and how they spiral from innocence to insanity. I can almost see it as if they are right next to me. Shudders.",t3_a8fogu
ech3ftq,t1_ecgq4n3,"Thank you, I appreciate that!",t3_a8fogu
ecc9hy2,t1_ecandr1,"When I first wrote this, the events occurred in sequential order, but the ending wasn't nearly as effective that way. I was worried that the alternating timelines would confuse people, but I'm glad it seems to have worked out.

Thank you so much for your thoughtful comment!",t3_a8fogu
ech62ai,t1_ech3ftq,No problem. Enjoy!,t3_a8fogu
