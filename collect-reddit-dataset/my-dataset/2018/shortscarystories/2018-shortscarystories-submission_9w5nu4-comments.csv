e9ijx26,t3_9w5nu4,i see some comments about the bully being baked into the cake. is that it? because i thought that the lady was poisoning the kid with the cake,t3_9w5nu4
e9i1nqo,t3_9w5nu4,"Ooh very subtle, well done",t3_9w5nu4

e9ip7n0,t3_9w5nu4,"Your work is amazing! The rhythm of your prose and simplicity of your language create such an effective tone of voice for this kind of straight-faced, subtle horror. Love it love it love it. ",t3_9w5nu4
e9it074,t3_9w5nu4,I love subtle horror. Great job!,t3_9w5nu4

egq9qeh,t3_9w5nu4,Reminds me of the worst pies in London,t3_9w5nu4
e9i1lo7,t1_e9i0ble,"The couple baked those they killed into the cakes- the wife making the cake and planning, the husband taking responsibility for clean up and hiding tracks. When the speaker saw what happened to the young man, she presumably killed the bully and baked them into the cake she will give to the young man. ",t3_9w5nu4
e9j52fs,t1_e9i0ble,"I definitely got the impression that they were poisoning the cakes (and therefore she was poisoning Ben), not that they were baking people into the cakes.

>They warn them about strangers in school, I know that, but Ben won't be bothered by me. I'm old, for one thing, and he's known me for years.

Sounds cryptically threatening. 

>If you leave so much as a single crumb it'll catch up with you. Now I have to do it all myself, too. When we were younger I just picked the guest and took care of refreshments. Jim was the one on clean-up.

A single crumb of poison would be more than enough to convict someone on...also she used to pick the guest, then Jim would handle the clean-up after the guest was dead. 

>It was like poison. Started in his stomach, but by the end it'd spread through his whole body. Karma, I guess some would call it.

Pretty self-explanatory I think? 

",t3_9w5nu4
e9i1t4b,t1_e9i0ble,Yeah i'm also a bit lost here.. Did she kill the bully and used him as an ingredient or something?,t3_9w5nu4
e9jnhab,t1_e9ijx26,"I'm pretty sure she baked the bully into the cake, she seems to like Ben so there'd be no reason for her to poison him with the cake.",t3_9w5nu4

e9k80s0,t1_e9k50kv,"Ah, good spot! Just fixed it. No matter how many times I re-read something there always seems to be at least one typo that slips through.",t3_9w5nu4
e9jk0ls,t1_e9i1lo7,"Thank you for clarifying. I was a little lost, myself.",t3_9w5nu4
e9i4b3b,t1_e9i1t4b,Yes,t3_9w5nu4
e9kf41y,t1_e9jnhab,"I agree there seems to be no reason to poison Ben, but the story reads more like poisoning cakes to me",t3_9w5nu4
