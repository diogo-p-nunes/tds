e8r4eqi,t3_9ss843,"Pretty difficult to follow, but I think I get it.

The narrator has nightmares about her magic hands drowning her, so she cuts them off? And then her hands come back and strangle her?",t3_9ss843
e8r4jgv,t3_9ss843,"Good premise, but hard to follow.",t3_9ss843
e8r3w5z,t3_9ss843,"I don’t get it, mate",t3_9ss843
e8rtvuo,t3_9ss843,"Hey OP.

You've gotten a lot of helpful constructive criticism and i hope you can re-write your story. It's got a lot of potential and it's very original. A little tidying up is all it needs. Aside from some confusion, i love it. ",t3_9ss843
e8r8muk,t3_9ss843,Explain pls,t3_9ss843
e8svaa6,t3_9ss843,"I think that this would be better with more length and a bit more time to delve into the concept, but I think I get it...? Her hands were protecting her, right? And once she cut them off they couldn't protect her anymore? It's really eerie and well written; I just think it needs more detail",t3_9ss843
e8s6mq4,t3_9ss843,OP needs to cut back on skin moisturizer with oils. ,t3_9ss843
e8tj4j4,t3_9ss843,"This story is only possible because of the advances in voice to text apps, without which typing would have been impossible.",t3_9ss843
e8tmqe8,t3_9ss843,"Upvoting for a great concept and great quality writing. For me, a few subtle rewrite to clarify the ending would really sell it. Look forward to seeing more from you",t3_9ss843
e8rt76u,t3_9ss843,"So for the grrandmother there was a long gap until she got strangled, but it was quick for the main character?",t3_9ss843
e8sg1ls,t3_9ss843,Why don't they get wet?,t3_9ss843
e8rp4pf,t1_e8r4eqi,[deleted],t3_9ss843
e8r49k1,t1_e8r3w5z,So our main characters hands were the only things keeping the “monsters” or hands away and as long as the character had their own they would be able to live (they’d continue to have nightmares but I intended that to be a sort of curse on the family) ,t3_9ss843
e8r8ppp,t1_e8r8muk,"Hey sorry if the story was hard to follow, I commented the explanation earlier so feel free to just look at that, thanks for reading :)  ",t3_9ss843
e8svke5,t1_e8svaa6,"Yup that’s it and thanks for the kind words and for reading! I’m always trying to find that balance between vivid description and drowning out the plot, so I think for my next story i’ll try and add little bit more “spice” as far as delving into the details ",t3_9ss843
e8tmun6,t1_e8tj4j4,Unless the hands from the nightmares typed the whole thing.. ,t3_9ss843
e8rtnlu,t1_e8rt76u,"I wouldn’t say it was quick because I didn’t really detail how long it was after the amputation but I suppose part of it is keeping them under control with memories? Once the main character became so numb as to cut off their hands it was only a matter of time, like the grandmother died shortly after the mom was born because she had lost the will to live (in my head she was afraid of dying while she was pregnant so when she gave birth she let the ghost hands take her) 

Sorry if that’s a lot and not too good of an explanation but I hope it helps  ",t3_9ss843
e8sin4p,t1_e8sg1ls,"It’s not really something that can be explained (or do I want to because the unexplained is usually what creeps me out the most) but if I had to give one it’s the family’s (since the grandmother was the same way) connection to those nightmares and a barrier against the hands in those nightmares from killing them. 

Think of it like this as long as the main character had them, the monsters could only “glide past” like the water and they could never actually make that connection to the real world. 

Thanks for reading! :) ",t3_9ss843
e8sh9ps,t1_e8rp4pf,"Only thing saving her from what? I'm pretty lost as well, but I'm really a sucker for stories about magic hands.",t3_9ss843
e8r61yu,t1_e8r49k1,I got that. (Not OP) I think her mums gloves made it confusing for me,t3_9ss843
e8rkvf7,t1_e8r49k1,So the grandmother cut her hands off and then she died? But what do the gloves have to do with anything?,t3_9ss843
e8sw65k,t1_e8svke5,"I wouldn't worry too much. This sub can make it hard to get that balance right. If you do something a bit longer, maybe try nosleep or creepypasta ",t3_9ss843
e8rl44n,t1_e8rkvf7,"She cut her hands off and had them replaced  and used gloves to hide her “skin” which were actually crude prosthetic hands and her cause of death was the same as our main character, sorry if the story was a bit convoluted  ",t3_9ss843
e8rp5jm,t1_e8rl44n,"So there was a long gap before she got strangled? That doesn't seem to be the case for the narrator. It's a creepy concept but the logic and timeline don't seem to work out, or aren't fleshed out enough to piece together.

Couple other reactions:

>When I do, the hands go limp and the water around them opens up like it would with my own.

You should make it clear that these are the hands from the dream. You put this sentence after writing about the mom holding hands on her deathbed, so it sounds like her hands are the ones going limp.

>So I thought my hands were the cause - and at some point I was numbed to the idea of cutting them off.

>And I did just that.

I know these stories have to be brief but it's a little jarring to jump from weird dreams to self-amputation in one sentence. Not sure how I'd address it but I think this could use a little more description of just how horrific it would be to cut off one's own hands... and you can't gloss over how you'd even go about doing it!

>In every surviving picture of my grandmother, she wore gloves and for the longest time I didn't know why.

Was it to protect her fragile skin from the horrors of the outside world?

This is exposition/foreshadowing, it should be at the beginning. The end is where all the story threads are wrapping together, so adding critical information at the last minute wrecks the pacing and suspense.

All in all though, very creative and the feeling of it raised a few hairs even if the plot was hard to follow.",t3_9ss843
e8s5hbv,t1_e8rl44n,Still confused. So are the hands possessed?,t3_9ss843
e8rpcx7,t1_e8rp5jm,"That’s actually some of the most constructive criticism i’ve ever gotten like honestly I appreciate you taking the time to point out where I misstepped and hopefully I can take your points and continue to improve my writing! And I honestly agree with how jarring it is to go from dreams to the amputation like I definitely could have pulled that off better. 

Thanks for reading and taking the time to give me a completely valid critique :) ",t3_9ss843
e8s8zwt,t1_e8s5hbv,They aren’t possessed more like the family is cursed and their hands are the only thing preventing them from being killed by those hands in their dreams ,t3_9ss843
e8rudmk,t1_e8rpcx7,"Hey. I just wanted to say thanks for taking that constructive criticism and not reacting negatively.  I see so many ask for it and then get defensive and shut-in when they get real criticism. It takes a big person to listen to someone point out their faults and move on with the intention of improving themselves. Not that all critiques will always be valid, but accepting constructive criticism with grace is still a tough thing to do for most. ",t3_9ss843
e8sa8gs,t1_e8s8zwt,I think the story is a great start. With a longer build-up you can subtlely convey some of this backstory to make it clearer what's happening. It would give it a stronger effect at the end.,t3_9ss843
