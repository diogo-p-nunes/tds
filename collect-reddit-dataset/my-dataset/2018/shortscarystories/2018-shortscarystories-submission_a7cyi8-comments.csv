My three data points were : bonnsch dialect, Venturini Motorsports and viburnum lantana.

Thanks u/BensTerribleFate for this challenge! ",t3_a7cyi8
ec3jtnn,t3_a7cyi8,"I really like this concept, Death just chilling and waiting for his moment.  The inner monologue grounds him and makes him normal, which keys up the reveal nicely.  I would have liked to have been clued in a bit to what the racer's fate was (I'm assuming a crash...), but other than that well done!

Glad you enjoyed the challenge, and props for being the first to take me up on it!",t3_a7cyi8
