e8hm1rx,t1_e8hcb9w,"The repetitive structure you used there is extremely effective. I’ve seen it quite a bit in poetry to develop a sense of inescapable infinity (or, at least, the feeling of something going on and on). In my opinion, it was the perfect way to end this piece, as those last feelings are now her eternity. Great work! :)",t3_9rg1f6
