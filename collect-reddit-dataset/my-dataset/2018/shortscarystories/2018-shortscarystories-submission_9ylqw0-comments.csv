ea2fh9e,t3_9ylqw0,"I liked this story but, if I were to give some constructive criticism to help edit this, I would say that there does seem to be a bit of a gap regarding info. Like what made him kill his wife? why did he change his mind and make the machine? and how was he able to make it? bc you'd think he'd be in prison for murder. But it was a good read and you obviously don't have to change anything XD",t3_9ylqw0
ea4bhfs,t3_9ylqw0,Hmm. The fact that killing murder-David made present-David vanish makes it sound like the murderer was his *past* self. But present-David doesnâ€™t seem to show any indication that he ever wanted to kill his wife,t3_9ylqw0
