ecm6erz,t3_a9syun,Slow fireworks is a gorgeous metaphor for such a gristly image.,t3_a9syun

ecmeuvy,t3_a9syun,This was amazing. That last paragraph killed me! Great job.,t3_a9syun
ecp2hu4,t3_a9syun,Nicely done. I like how well it flows. Managed to veer from uncomfortable to unsettling without missing a beat. ,t3_a9syun
ecml4p9,t1_ecm6erz,Thank you! It was a metaphor I cannibalised from another short story that didn't work out. I just liked the image enough that I felt it was worth salvaging.,t3_a9syun
ecmj838,t1_ecmelpj,"I am also pretty confused. I think that the “slow fireworks” might be the narrator’s period blood diffusing through the bath water, which first happened when she was 11. 

But since then, she hasn’t had any more periods, and she’s now 13. So I have two interpretations: either she was raped, like you said, presumably by one of her relatives, and was carrying a child but miscarried. I’m thinking this because of the line “silence within me ever since.” Or she went through early menopause? 

I don’t know, haha. If the author or anyone who has a better grasp of the story’s meaning could enlighten me, that’d be great.",t3_a9syun
ecmkrkl,t1_ecmelpj,"Not to be obnoxious and spam the comment around but I wanted to make sure your question was answered so here's a copy paste from another comment:

"" My intent was that she'd suffered some kind of internal malady when she was eleven that left her sterile. She was never pregnant, but she stopped having periods. She hasn't been raped, but her family has decided it's time for her to be ""bred"", and they're not going to take kindly to finding out she can't have children. I left it pretty vague so as to be more ominous.

The story is supposed to lead the reader to believe she is upset that she's suffered a miscarriage in the bath and is trying to decide how to tell her family while she receives baby gifts, but the reveal is that it was simply a medical issue that left her sterile and she's just a little girl. Her parents want her to bear children (for whatever their sinister purpose might be) and she's afraid because she can't.""

Sometimes I feel like I'm too vague because I'm afraid of giving away the ending.

ecml06w,t1_ecmeuvy,Thank you so much! I'm afraid I may have written it too opaquely because some people weren't able to glean exactly what was going on. I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_a9syun

ecn6y7b,t1_ecml06w,There’s a little confusion.  Obviously they think she’s pregnant and she’s not because she hasn’t had a period since her first one but...who got her pregnant at 13?,t3_a9syun
econtv7,t1_ecml06w,"Nah I understood completely what happened, hence why it hit so hard. It was sad enough until then, I was properly taken aback ",t3_a9syun
ecmpbyg,t1_ecmkguf,"Oh, wow, that’s super creepy. It makes so much more sense now. Thanks for the reply!",t3_a9syun
ecmjfh5,t1_ecmjayi,"Yes, I also believe that, but it’s the sections about the bathtub and the “silence within me” that are tripping me up.",t3_a9syun
ecog4ca,t1_ecn6y7b,Nobody. They've decided she's *going* to be pregnant.,t3_a9syun
