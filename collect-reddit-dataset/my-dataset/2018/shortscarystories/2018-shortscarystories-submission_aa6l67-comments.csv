ecplu7l,t3_aa6l67,"i like this..

&#x200B;

but imagine.. if he didn't keep the soap..and actually used it..that would be more disgusting..",t3_aa6l67
ecptm4j,t3_aa6l67,"I kind of like this because it messed with my expectations. I thought that the boy was going upstairs into danger, but he wasn‚Äôt. I thought the soap was a weapon or trinket of some kind, but it wasn‚Äôt. I thought the old lady was a helpful guardian of some sort, but she was just a batshit ghost who killed her kids.

I‚Äôm not sure how it was supposed to be interpreted but the way I did made it pretty enjoyable. Cheers.",t3_aa6l67
ecpq4u9,t3_aa6l67,Excuse me as I now never use bar soap again in my life,t3_aa6l67
ecq03wl,t3_aa6l67,"Nice story but I'd end with ""I wish I hadn't used the soap"" for a slightly higher disgust level",t3_aa6l67

ecpz3xo,t3_aa6l67,"Great idea, now that's the type of twist I like! I think the story could be improved stylistically (also why did that German woman speak English?), but I still like it a lot!",t3_aa6l67

ecpv3h8,t3_aa6l67,I swear I already saw this story? What's the deal,t3_aa6l67
ecrmigu,t1_ecplu7l,"yeah, replace ""kept"" with ""used"" and it would be perfect",t3_aa6l67
ecpu02f,t1_ecptm4j,"Yes, I definitely tried to lead the reader astray with a number of things. So glad you enjoyed it! Thanks :) ",t3_aa6l67

ecq08a4,t1_ecq03wl,"Haha I tend to shy away from the 'ew' side of horror in general, but I will try to mix it up in the future üòä thanks for reading! ",t3_aa6l67
ecpz72d,t1_ecpz3xo,"Thanks for the tips :) Always appreciate constructive feedback. Since the woman is a ghost or apparition I was going a bit with the thought she could communicate based on who she was trying to speak to, but that is definitely something that could be tightened. ",t3_aa6l67

ecpu9e1,t1_ecprphg,This ones on you,t3_aa6l67
ecpznp4,t1_ecpz72d,"Oh, that actually makes sense, I just missed the fact that she's a ghost/apparition!",t3_aa6l67

ecpuaek,t1_ecpu9e1,I meant it as in don't do the thing but I guess as long as you still shower daily?,t3_aa6l67
ecpzq9w,t1_ecpznp4,"Yes, in rereading I did think I could have made that a bit clearer, but I didn't want to risk muddying up the final paragraph any further :P",t3_aa6l67
ecpyhkd,t1_ecpyfz7,"No problem, I understand. I assumed some people would ask haha. ",t3_aa6l67
ecpz02k,t1_ecpyujh,"It's frustrating, I totally understand the rule in the sense of preventing spam but when a legitimate story has already garnered a pretty positive response you would think they might make exceptions. But I'm new haha what do I know.

They also removed another of mine so if you see that one again in a day, you'll know why üòÇ",t3_aa6l67
ecq2sqn,t1_ecpz02k,"While I get how it annoys some people the rule hasn't always been here, and it's not really to prevent spam. The sub ended up being dominated by a small handful of (very talented) writers. But this meant lesser known ones, or new ones, kept being ignored and skipt over. Its to allow people an equal chance to be seen really.

The sub has definitely improved since they added the rule quite a while back",t3_aa6l67

ectgfcm,t1_ecso9az,"No its not. It's doing the opposite. Honestly this post wouldn't have 20 upvotes back in those days.

And that's nothing to do with quality. But it was flooded with so many of people's favourite authors and unknown people yours just would have been lost. What you want is for you to post multiple times a day. But if you do then everyone will, and yours simply won't be seen",t3_aa6l67
