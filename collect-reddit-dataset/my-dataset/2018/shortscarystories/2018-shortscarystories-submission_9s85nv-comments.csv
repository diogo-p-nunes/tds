But it's boring in quarantine, and people have been starting to think maybe there's not an infection at all. Some people have even been wondering whether the infection is a ruse by the government used to isolate people they don't like outside the camps and starve or kill them. At the end, the zombies/starving people break into the camp, and the narrator, who can't see what they look like and doesn't know what to believe, decides to shoot them",t3_9s85nv
