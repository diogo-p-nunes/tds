ecoiqxl,t3_a9s68v,"Reminds me of the songs ""Magic Mirror"" and ""Mirror Magic."" They have basically the same premise. Can't remember which one of the songs is the first one but basically there's a princess who cannot walk and her kingdom is in shambles. There appears a magician in her mirror and grants her wishes. He grants her the ability to walk, he grants her friends, he ensures her kingdom is safe and secure. Then he disappears.

In the second song, we learn that the ""magician"" was her male equivalent from another dimension. He was a prince in a nice country and he was incredibly popular amongst the people. A real magician comes into the castle on a stormy winter night and tells the prince the scales of luck are entirely on his side and that he should look into the mirror to see how his counterpart is doing. The prince then decides to break his own legs to grant the girl the ability to walk, he declares war to grant the girl's kingdom peace, and he falls out with his friends to get the girl some.",t3_a9s68v
