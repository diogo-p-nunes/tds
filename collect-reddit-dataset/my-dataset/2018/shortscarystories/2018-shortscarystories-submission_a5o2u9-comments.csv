ebo5m42,t3_a5o2u9,So wholesome. I love it. ,t3_a5o2u9
ebpdj1w,t3_a5o2u9,"Is this ""demon"" depression? I just got that thought",t3_a5o2u9
ebty2vg,t3_a5o2u9,"You piece of shit I can look at crime scene photos and read these fucked up stories all damn day...

But when you put a *doggo* in these stories??? I am a PUDDLE. ",t3_a5o2u9
ebo6qrd,t3_a5o2u9,Love this üôÇ!,t3_a5o2u9
ebodszk,t3_a5o2u9,‚ù§,t3_a5o2u9
eboran4,t3_a5o2u9,I'm so glad it ended happily lol I was afraid the dog was going to get hurt.,t3_a5o2u9
ebpwypd,t3_a5o2u9,"I feel so dumb for not guessing he was a dog, I was like ""Huh, friends who speak different languages, no translator, he watches tv in the other guy's language with no subtitles... weird."" I absolutely love it!!! When he knocked the razor blade out of his hand it reminded me of The Art Of Racing In The Rain. ",t3_a5o2u9

ebomuik,t3_a5o2u9,This made me cry. Amazing job. Thank you,t3_a5o2u9
ebpwt3g,t3_a5o2u9,Awwe!,t3_a5o2u9
ebqdtyb,t3_a5o2u9,"I was reading this at work and i started crying, great read!",t3_a5o2u9
ebshr3p,t3_a5o2u9,I shouldn't cut onions while I read these stories.,t3_a5o2u9
ec2kkgj,t3_a5o2u9,Very Nice,t3_a5o2u9
ec3dilf,t3_a5o2u9,Beautifully written. Very poetic and touching.,t3_a5o2u9
eboqvfv,t3_a5o2u9,"I'm a dog

This would explain the way he could see a demon. Sometimes dogs can see something that humans can't",t3_a5o2u9
ebosjqh,t3_a5o2u9,Was the demon an abusive girlfriend?,t3_a5o2u9
ebpnic4,t1_ebpdj1w,"Yep :), that's actually the second twist of the story. Mr doggo sees his friend's new self destructive behavior as its own entity rather than as his actual self (which is what depression kinda is). At least that's the message I wanted to convey, but had to cut short because of word limits :)",t3_a5o2u9
ebp3z57,t1_eboqvfv,"There's a actually a second twist in the story, there was no demon :p",t3_a5o2u9
ebotlfx,t1_ebosjqh,It's depression. The guy held a razor blade to his own wrist. ,t3_a5o2u9
ebx3ddy,t1_ebpnic4,This is so clever! Dogs and cats are supposed to be really adept at sensing moods and even illnesses... what if it's because they see them as demonic entities undetectable to the human eye?,t3_a5o2u9
ebsyq16,t1_ebpnic4,Aaaah I see,t3_a5o2u9
ebq2t56,t1_ebp3z57,"The ‚Äúdemon‚Äù was depression, right? The friend actually threw the instrument at a time he was feeling really bad. Or am I wrong?",t3_a5o2u9
ebp3zj9,t1_ebotlfx,Yep :),t3_a5o2u9
ebqo3ip,t1_ebq2t56,you're correct!. he was trying to play and then a depression episode takes over and tossed the instrument.,t3_a5o2u9
