eaw4ie0,t1_eav690r,"The story was very poetic, but didn’t have a coherent plot behind it.",t3_a23yod
eb0319k,t1_eaw4ie0,"I figured it might be too cryptic. The plot is adultery, “there’s just something about fire” which translates to “there’s just something about her.” The glimmer of gold is the wedding ring, he burned his marriage to be with her giving all of his love and devotion to her children when he should have been giving it to his wife, when he finally realized his marriage was truly gone and all he had left was that tiny gold ring he asked his mistress for his heart back having regretted letting her have it in the first place. ",t3_a23yod
eb17lz0,t1_eb0319k,"Ah. Yeah that wasn’t very obvious on the first read. Maybe if you change the last line to make it more obvious it was an affair.
Good job! ",t3_a23yod
