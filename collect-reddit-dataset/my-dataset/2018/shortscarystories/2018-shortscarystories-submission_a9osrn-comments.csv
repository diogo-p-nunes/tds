ecm39w3,t1_eclyop7,"Well you went in a direction I wasn't really thinking off! :D Thanks for the reply though.

My idea behind this was honestly more deeper than this.

This guy is actually already dead. But he killed his own family and sinned deeply, thus the reliving nightmare. He was sent to 'hell' or a variant of it called 'the abyss', where the souls endure all kinds of punishments in darkness, wandering eternally until they become a hollow tortured shell, moved only by hunger. (Yeah that part might have some similarity with being a zombie, plus you would think he have mutated into one because he got bit!)

I thought one would slighty notice that he couldn't have been alive for so many days without eating, drinking or sleeping properly (or being dressed for the intense cold), but from your point of view it might have been possible for him to be injected with something that made him survive, who knows?",t3_a9osrn

ecm541u,t1_ecm4rna,Yes I completely agree. Thanks! I tried to focus on the negative side of the emotions but I need to get my writing better to express that.,t3_a9osrn
