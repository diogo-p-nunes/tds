ecm4cxg,t3_a9sh33,"I think the story is good overall, if not a bit clichey (focus on the sense of being observed). Keep writing!

The way you wrote it... is it really happening or happened to you? You brought up a lot of details (your son into FNAF, or sounds into the attic) that could indeed be real.

If it is, I would suggest you to hire someone to investigate your attic. Mine was an old house and there was a couple of skunks wandering around in the attic wood planks. (and they had offspring so the noise was even more constant after).",t3_a9sh33
ecm17wm,t3_a9sh33,Time to move!,t3_a9sh33
ecm6zgc,t3_a9sh33,I don't understand the final part... Explain please? And what does the son's room have to do with it all?,t3_a9sh33
ecmbfia,t3_a9sh33,Okay thank you for the input,t3_a9sh33
ecn1q80,t3_a9sh33,"Wait this is actually real? Well I'd recommend if it's a duplex getting someone to investigate, hopefully it's animals if not having some security cameras would be good and of course not just your side but the other place it's connected to",t3_a9sh33
ecm1d6q,t1_ecm17wm,I hate the feeling of someone possibly watching me and my family...,t3_a9sh33
ecmbljm,t1_ecm6zgc,"His room is a bit creepy, gives me a weird vibe and maybe has something to do with the creepy attic if it is a ghost... and the ending was maybe someone from my neighbors house crawled into our conjoined attic? It's a long stretch but who the hell knows?! ðŸ˜‚",t3_a9sh33
ecm1l70,t1_ecm1d6q,Especially while you sleep,t3_a9sh33
ecm1poj,t1_ecm1l70,Yes. I heard footsteps and told my husband about it said it was an animal. Lmao. Sounded like someone walked over to our vent and stopped... needless to say... didnt sleep well that night. ,t3_a9sh33
