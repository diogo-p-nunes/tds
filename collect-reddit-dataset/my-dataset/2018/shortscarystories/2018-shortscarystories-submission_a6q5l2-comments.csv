ebx078p,t3_a6q5l2,don't think I've read anything like this here and tbh your writing makes me wish there was more of it! this was a unique story and your writing style is beautiful! great story OP.,t3_a6q5l2
ebx94ya,t3_a6q5l2,"Loved this. Don‚Äôt mean to sound mean, but this sub is usually full of utter tripe and it‚Äôs refreshing to not only get something a bit different, but written very beautifully.",t3_a6q5l2
ebxf5w3,t3_a6q5l2,This is poetry. ,t3_a6q5l2
ebx7fg3,t3_a6q5l2,"This is genuinely beautiful and eerie, but I must point out:   

> ""A vessel must have a name, and to consider each one an 'it' and not a 'she' is unconscionable to a sailor. A ship is shaped by human hands and designs, cared for by its crew, roars with the life of its engines.""   


But 2 lines later   



> ""A consciousness resides within, a sense of purpose bestowed upon it by its captain and crew. It knows that the sailors on board are its caretakers, and its role in turn is to shield them from the wind and the waves and bear them safely to land.""",t3_a6q5l2

ebxvoq1,t3_a6q5l2,"Once in a gloomy blue moon, there is a pearl of genius amidst a haunted sea of shipwrecks. Glad I got a notification for this piece, cause it's a solid piece, my man. Not quite scary, but definitely has a sad tone with the mood of inevitable doom, which is more than enough for most stories on this subreddit. Love the metaphors of death and burial at sea. Most stories on this subreddit are (frankly) quite shit, but this is the exception. I'll follow you to read more stuff like this. Please don't ever stop writing.",t3_a6q5l2

Thanks for posting it",t3_a6q5l2
ebyn4jo,t3_a6q5l2,Really well done! Your storytelling is poetic and engaging without giving too much away at once. :-),t3_a6q5l2
ebyq8wz,t3_a6q5l2,This was incredible!  One of the most unique and beautifully frightening stories I've ever read.  Just wow.,t3_a6q5l2
ec0nft3,t3_a6q5l2,"Beautiful writing! 

Now I'm worried anything of steel on dry land is haunted by the angered spirits of disassembled ships.

And trains. 

And cars. 

And... bicycles.

ebxyn1z,t3_a6q5l2,"I can imagine this as an opening for a good nautical horror/thriller. Ship gets into a storm, which first fierce, then more and more unrealistically finding weak points, then horror then the end of the storm and some flotsam.

Kind of the spirit of the ship itself if it was a well looked after/loved ship, google it and have a read up if not, but I'm guessing you might have.",t3_a6q5l2

ebzu9q5,t1_ebx0q86,"This is a really bizarre coincidence. I had this story (Salvage) open in a tab all day to read yesterday but didn't get around to it. I ended up going to a friend's to study for finals and in conversation dogs came up and I thought of Must Love Dogs and totally forgot what it'd been called and ended up going on like a half hour hunt to find it (which I did eventually in my saved posts). And yet I had this open in a tab containing the link?!

This is so uncanny and so weird hahahaha",t3_a6q5l2

ebx93rs,t1_ebx8gmc,"The narrator is obviously someone who knows a lot about ships and believes in their power - so while the narrator may not be a sailor personally, they obviously are in some way affiliated with sailing or are a sailing afficionado. The narrator says that sailors call ships a ""she"" rather than an ""it"" - but goes on to refer to the ship's consciousness as an ""it"" 2 sentences later. I found that a bit jarring.",t3_a6q5l2
ebx91ps,t1_ebx8gmc,I believe his point is the narrator calls the ship an ‚ÄúIt‚Äù after saying sailors call it a ‚ÄúShe‚Äù but at no point does the narrator seem like a sailor.,t3_a6q5l2

Not a sailor myself, but I recently started a new job in a Comms role for a publication about the shipping industry which helped inspire this story.

In any case, glad to hear you enjoyed it, and hope the change helps it flow better. Thanks! ",t3_a6q5l2
