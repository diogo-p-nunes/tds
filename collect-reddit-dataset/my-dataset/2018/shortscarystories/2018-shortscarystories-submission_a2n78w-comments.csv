eb185v1,t1_eb0qqqy,A take on the Four Horsemen? Or am I just daft?,t3_a2n78w
eb1bf6u,t1_eb185v1,"No, although I almost certainly took some subconscious inspiration from that idea. 

It’s open to interpretation who exactly the Four spirits are, what they do, etc. 

What is not open to interpretation, however, is that having them visit your town at midnight is not going to be a pleasant experience 😁",t3_a2n78w
eb1bgh2,t1_eb1bf6u,Nice,t3_a2n78w
