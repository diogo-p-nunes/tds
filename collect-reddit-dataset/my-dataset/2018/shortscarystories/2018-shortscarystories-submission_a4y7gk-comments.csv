All jokes aside, I really like this",t3_a4y7gk
ebjt39h,t3_a4y7gk,"This was really good, thank you! ",t3_a4y7gk
ebjuc3w,t3_a4y7gk,"I really enjoyed the prose in this story - it's simple, yet effective, and relays the image of a simple country boy narrator very well.

This story actually reminds me a bit of the short story Deep Blood Kettle by Hugh Howey.",t3_a4y7gk

eblj9v1,t1_ebjujqe,"If the rest of your stories are as good as his one, I canâ€™t wait to check your narrations out!",t3_a4y7gk
eblnjlt,t1_eblj9v1,Thanks very much! I've got a few live already and I'll strive to do the rest ASAP and when I've convinced myself that I can do a passable American accent for the ones that need it ,t3_a4y7gk
