eatehsr,t3_a1sf07,"The most hated question, but I have to ask: where'd you get this idea? It's so atmospheric and mysterious, and the delivery makes it seem larger than it is. This is really well-written.",t3_a1sf07
eau7jiq,t3_a1sf07,"Love the writing style and how you created a great atmosphere with words. Gave me a very dickensian feeling. 
I am a bit confused about the story though. Why did the woman accuse the man? And what exactly did he turn into? Zombie? Werewolf? And what's the significance of the droplets in the end? Sorry if I'm being dumb!",t3_a1sf07

eatifcb,t1_eatehsr,"Wow, thanks!  I’m glad you liked it.

To answer your question—it first came to me when I was half asleep and not thinking too hard about anything.  The idea of a wrongly accused man who is able to relentlessly track the woman responsible for his death because he’d smelled her is what initially appealed to me, and I went from there.  I also love westerns, and although I’ve been a longtime lurker on this sub, I haven’t seen many of them since I’ve been reading.  

Lastly I’ll just mention that I’m a filmmaker, so I kind of naturally default to thinking about the sounds of the story in addition to the dialogue and action.  That’s why I included the bit about the steady sounds drums in the distance from the gypsy camp.  Even though it doesn’t really add anything to the narrative of the story, it adds to the atmosphere (hopefully!)",t3_a1sf07
