e9qgtmk,t3_9x65em,"I'm going to tell you a little bit about my nightly routine: after taking a shower and before I go to sleep, I read this subreddits' daily Top stories, starting with the ones with the least upvotes and upwards. I play this little game where I have to either downvote or upvote each story, but I can leave one blank. Today I came up with another game: I had to vote on every story, and leave a detailed comment in all of them.

You may be asking yourself, ""Why is this creeper telling me about his nightly routine?"" Great question, buddy! You see, I have to write all of this crap because I don't have an elaborate comment for you or your tale. All I can say is: GREAT FUCKING STORY!!!!!",t3_9x65em

eaf12cc,t3_9x65em,"Old thread but you fell into a trap that a lot of scary story writers fall into, the ""include gore for no reason"" trope. If the story had ended with him disappearing into nothing, something closer to I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream it would've had the same effect and would be more profound than dude just melting away.",t3_9x65em
