e9mgmu2,t3_9wnq20,"Dear diary, the weekend with Uncle John was blast! We stayed up late, made s’mores in the fire place, and he even played dolls with me! When I got back, mommy felt all better which is very good! I missed her!",t3_9wnq20
e9ml9zc,t3_9wnq20,Can someone explain who is Uncle John to mummy? ,t3_9wnq20
e9monv5,t3_9wnq20,"This doesn’t make any sense, who is uncle John? Is he just a random killer that somehow convinced a woman in a crowded theater to let him take her and her kid home so he could murder her? So many plot holes for it to be scary",t3_9wnq20
e9n9n46,t3_9wnq20,"I thought Uncle John was her lover and they were going to kill the husband and the. EITHER a) they got in a fight and he killed the mom instead or b) the mom was going to stay behind and clean up the mess. 

But the serial killer things makes a ton more sense ",t3_9wnq20
e9mqlrq,t3_9wnq20,"It's not hard to understand. They go to the movies and they become the Target of some sadistic guy. Gut tells the little girl he's Uncle John, tells the mom if she makes a scene her and the daughter are dead. When they get to the house, the mom tells the girl to go upstairs and proceeds to try and fight off the guy. She gets murdered, guy tells the little girl her mom is asleep and proceeds to abduct the little girl.",t3_9wnq20
e9mgyzw,t3_9wnq20,"so the mom got raped? sorry, i’m slow",t3_9wnq20
e9mh2s3,t3_9wnq20,Real fear is when you can't figure out how you would get out of a situation. This is that for me.,t3_9wnq20
e9mt9mv,t3_9wnq20,"All they wanted was a Mommy/Daughter Day... Poor things...

I’m gonna go have a good cry now.

Heartbreakingly beautiful story, OP! Well done!",t3_9wnq20
e9n0eak,t3_9wnq20,I think what makes this story confusing is the beginning. Why was she taken out of school for the day? Why was Daddy going away for the weekend? Was her mommy a drug addict and the guy who kidnapped them was her dealer and she owed him money? Was it all just a coincidence? Was her daddy murdered also? So many questions. ,t3_9wnq20
e9mbcqy,t3_9wnq20,Honestly I like the concept.  Kind of has a 97 bonnie and clyde thing going for it.  Keep it up,t3_9wnq20
e9mveti,t3_9wnq20,I like it! It's not hard to understand and I like the innocent point of view of the girl,t3_9wnq20
e9nc992,t3_9wnq20,I've definitely seen this story before...,t3_9wnq20
e9mpk87,t3_9wnq20,I didn't understand this at all. ,t3_9wnq20
e9n2mvr,t3_9wnq20,"Wait, did this guy know the mom or not? Why did she go along to the murder tool shop?",t3_9wnq20
e9mvd28,t3_9wnq20,"Sounds like a fun camping trip :)

I like the idea but just from the title and the mention of Uncle John I knew the inevitable would happen. I do like children’s perspectives though, as I write that way sometimes.",t3_9wnq20
e9n8db7,t3_9wnq20,Uncle John was moms lover. They decided to kill the child and then they will run away. ,t3_9wnq20
e9mqno8,t3_9wnq20,"Keep it up, it's a story that allows you to think, that's what makes a good scary story",t3_9wnq20

e9nh1hh,t1_e9mgmu2,There needs to be an r/thirdsentencehappy for this sub lol,t3_9wnq20
e9mlsw8,t1_e9ml9zc,"I'm also confused, I thought maybe he was a stranger that the mom also just met that then threatened her during the movie? I don't know if that makes sense though. ",t3_9wnq20
e9mmlcs,t1_e9ml9zc,Some dude who abducted them at the movie theatre.,t3_9wnq20
e9n8luz,t1_e9mqlrq,Ehhh,t3_9wnq20
e9n06vf,t1_e9mqlrq,And it was all written in the perspective of a little girl ,t3_9wnq20
e9mh17d,t1_e9mgyzw,Maybe murdered.,t3_9wnq20
e9nzka7,t1_e9mh2s3,"Chances are, if you are being abducted from a public place, wherever the kidnapper wants to take you  is going to be worse than where you are right now. Fighting not to go with them might be the best bet. In this case, making a scene before leaving the movie theater would have either resulted in the guy panicking and running off, or at the very least there would have been a lot more witnesses around than inside a home or in the middle of the woods.
