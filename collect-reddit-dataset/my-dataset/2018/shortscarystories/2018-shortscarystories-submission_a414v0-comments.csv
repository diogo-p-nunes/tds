ebcbnp7,t3_a414v0,"I was honestly expecting this to be more of a changeling story.

eos83pt,t3_a414v0,This is my greatest fear. There was a breaking news long ago when i was little.. here in India a man sneaked into a family's home in middle of day and snuck quietly under the parent's bed and in the middle of the night he killed the entire family while they were sleeping. I heard it when i was like 7.. but i still get goosebumps all over n check my beds n bathrooms whenevr i remember this.,t3_a414v0
