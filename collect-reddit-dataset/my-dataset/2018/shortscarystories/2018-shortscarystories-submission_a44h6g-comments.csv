ebc6git,t3_a44h6g,"Gandy dancing is actually a lost art, a really cool and distinctly American version of fettling. There are rumours that military call and response in WW1 grew out of drafted coloured railroad men taking their way of staying in time while working and adapting it to army life - marching, etc.",t3_a44h6g

ebd893h,t1_ebc6git,"I always say I’m “having a fettle” when I’m going to do the housework, you know, hoovering/tidying the house?? Didn’t know if it was a Yorkshire or U.K. thing? ",t3_a44h6g
