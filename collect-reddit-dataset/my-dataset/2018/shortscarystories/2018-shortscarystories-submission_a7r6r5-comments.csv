ec64tai,t3_a7r6r5,"I like how vague it is. how many questions it raises without answering them back. (I love open ended stories)

one of the best stories I've read lately. ",t3_a7r6r5
ec5akzo,t3_a7r6r5,Wow. Just... Wow. ,t3_a7r6r5
ec5ckoi,t3_a7r6r5,Outstanding,t3_a7r6r5
ec6hljr,t1_ec5qs2x,I love a complex villain. Or in this case not a villain yet .,t3_a7r6r5

ec5cwfs,t1_ec5ckoi,Thank you! ,t3_a7r6r5
ec7z9tc,t1_ec6hljr,SAme! someone who knows he's heading that way but not wanting to be that person. Villains like that are so underrated.,t3_a7r6r5
ec88hv5,t1_ec7z9tc,"Also the Villains that own it, but have a “good streak” that thier always fighting.

If you watch Doctor Who The Master and more so Missy are kind of that way.

They are evil, they love it, but they are pitiable and they have this little streak of goodness that totally ..well...fucks with you.
Love it.

Magneto is an even better example or Regina on Once Upon a Time.",t3_a7r6r5
ec88s2r,t1_ec88hv5,Yes I do watch Doctor Who and yeah I agree I don't /can't seem to hate Missy/the Master,t3_a7r6r5
ec8947j,t1_ec88s2r,"Actually the story of The Master’s origin. With the schism got me thinking along these lines.

Glad you get me.",t3_a7r6r5
