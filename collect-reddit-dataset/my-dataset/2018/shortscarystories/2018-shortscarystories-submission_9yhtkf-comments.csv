ea1eb8n,t3_9yhtkf,"Sorry, if the language is bad. I wrote the story in german and had to translate it.",t3_9yhtkf
ea1ulqp,t3_9yhtkf,So much fun to read! I thought the boy would attack “father” more directly. ,t3_9yhtkf
ea2c2vq,t3_9yhtkf,"Nice. I like it.

Well, I hate Father and I wouldn't mind a follow up where you explain in intricate detail how a bunch of Returnees are slaughtering him, but I think that's what makes the story good. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea2unnj,t3_9yhtkf,"Good read, even if I am burned out on zombies, I enjoyed it",t3_9yhtkf
ea29hov,t3_9yhtkf,Can someone explain the end? Did his mom really die and what happened to his sister? Who was the man at the gate?,t3_9yhtkf
ea2lkik,t3_9yhtkf,"Beautifully written, thanks for sharing your vision of this bleak future. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea2o3tc,t3_9yhtkf,Well done!!!!,t3_9yhtkf
ea5bwuw,t3_9yhtkf,Good story. Reminded me a lot of The Walking Dead. I pictured the town the Saviors would stop by a lot to pillage and the mayor dude would let them do as they wish with everyone and everything until Maggie stepped up and took over. ,t3_9yhtkf
ear6hym,t3_9yhtkf,This is fantastic. It reminds me of the old and classic sci-fi writing. ,t3_9yhtkf
ea2tz75,t3_9yhtkf,It's nice to see a nice read with a common setting. Well done!,t3_9yhtkf
eal6edd,t3_9yhtkf,"Your story is short, but it is big on ideas! Loved it.",t3_9yhtkf
ebb7sxg,t3_9yhtkf,Aw yeah!!,t3_9yhtkf
ecp87te,t3_9yhtkf,I would read this if it were made into a novel.,t3_9yhtkf
ea34zgk,t3_9yhtkf,I feel like people are giving you on overly hard time with grammar but your story was great ,t3_9yhtkf
ea1kfbz,t1_ea1eb8n,"That's ok, the story is still good. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea1su7c,t1_ea1eb8n,"That actually makes replying with editorial comments better! 

>     With most of humanity whiped out
""whiped"" should be ""wiped"". The past tense of wipe. ""Whiped"" isn't a word. ""Whipped"" is a word, past tense of whip, but it wouldn't be used here.

>     Every day began with a devine service. 
""devine"" should be ""divine"". ",t3_9yhtkf
ea1mhr1,t1_ea1eb8n,">  It may well be that this place got the name Arche for a reason.

Guessing arche stands for ark? It confused me because I thought the change in spelling had some sort of significance lol. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea39tn2,t1_ea1eb8n,It is actually excellent man,t3_9yhtkf
ea1qnzf,t1_ea1eb8n,Spot the German redditor :),t3_9yhtkf
ea2pe4i,t1_ea1eb8n,Didn’t think the language was bad at all. Great story! ,t3_9yhtkf
ea2r1yv,t1_ea1eb8n,No need to apologise at all. This was a great story!,t3_9yhtkf
ec09m8w,t1_ea1eb8n,It was a hell of a lot better than my German...,t3_9yhtkf
egj6cnu,t1_ea1eb8n,"You can writer better in English than most native speakers. Seriously, my father can't even write a simple ""went fishing at Mermac Springs"" message. It reads ""wet fistin + mornec spirt"", which, if you can't read gibberish, sounds very disturbing, and disgusting.",t3_9yhtkf
ea2c8yy,t1_ea2c2vq,That would be less horror and more gore. ,t3_9yhtkf
ea2uv5i,t1_ea2unnj,"My last story ""the statue"" was about vampires (if you are not burned out on them too) and for tomorrow I have another zombie free story prepared ""the hitchhiker"". ",t3_9yhtkf
ea2ajoq,t1_ea29hov,"Yes, his mom died. 
His sister was ""traded"" as a slave to the caravan. 
The man at the gate was just a random surviver.
The protagonist is writing a note for potential other survivers to find it. To explain what happend and as a confession.
 ",t3_9yhtkf
ear6l0h,t1_ear6hym,Thx. ,t3_9yhtkf
ea1v456,t1_ea1su7c,"Thanks, changed it.",t3_9yhtkf
ea1n2q6,t1_ea1mhr1,"Thanks for the hint, i didn't see that.",t3_9yhtkf
ea1r1mx,t1_ea1qnzf,Better to write in German than not writing at all.,t3_9yhtkf
ec09s1o,t1_ec09m8w,"Yeah, German is like the end boss of languages. But this goes both ways.",t3_9yhtkf
ea2cmnn,t1_ea2c8yy,"Yeah, I know. I just really hate characters like that because of their actions and how they think they are in a position where they should be allowed to do that. You managed to stir up some good negative feelings in me towards the father characters, so I think it's a good story. Horror shouldn't always be about fear, it can be about being horrified of what's happening. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea2jcls,t1_ea2ajoq,"For the record, that was very clear. Aside from maybe this being a note from the narrator. ",t3_9yhtkf
ea1nlww,t1_ea1n2q6,No worries. Good story :),t3_9yhtkf
ea1r49l,t1_ea1r1mx,Sure! It’s just a game I’ve been playing so don’t take me wrong :),t3_9yhtkf
ea2dhg5,t1_ea2cmnn,Mission accomplished. :) ,t3_9yhtkf
ea30v5f,t1_ea2jcls,I meant it as in how the mom actually died? My bad. I felt as if Father was lying.,t3_9yhtkf
ea1r86j,t1_ea1r49l,"It's OK. I am new to reddit, so there might be some things going over my head. :) ",t3_9yhtkf
ea3eu09,t1_ea2dhg5,"Yes, definitely :) ",t3_9yhtkf
ea33ije,t1_ea30v5f,"Oh yeah! Agreed, I also thought he killed her.",t3_9yhtkf
ea3bgw9,t1_ea33ije,"In an earlier draft he killed her by accident. He began to show interest in the sister. The mother begged him to spare her. He got angry, slapped her and she fell, hitting her head.
I had to cut this part to stay under 500 words. And I think even without this, you can see what a kind of guy he was.",t3_9yhtkf
