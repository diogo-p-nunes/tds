ebpw9fl,t3_a5vats,Are you really from Newark? With the street names being correct it seems like you are. Anyways i used to live in Newark myself. I worked and resided at 380/ 402 mt prospect. I went to put my son in the high school there but decided on a charter school instead. You had to gi thru this metal window less door that had a metal dector to walk thru immediately upon the door opening with police standing there. I felt like it was a prison and not a school. He did very well in the charter school which had a total of 20 students in downtown Newark.,t3_a5vats

So...I was completely shocked. Great story-telling. I was completely absorbed in it and would like to read more that you’ve written. Are you writing just for fun? Just for Reddit? ",t3_a5vats

eep9gzr,t1_eep83h8,Thanks for taking the time to read my story and commenting. I want to point out that for me and I suppose a lot of people criticism is hard to take but I'm getting better at it. If I was coming across as a dick I apologise.,t3_a5vats

ebrg1a2,t1_ebqjyt8,">implying that it automatically makes the story less interesting.

not really. but if the author puts a twist, it's to surprise. otherwise, well, it could be use as some kind of literary figure, but that's literature stuff and not really storytelling (but then, who was the line?)

also, people tend to point it out (well, at least *I do*) as a way to say, ""hey, I'm clever, I managed to figure it out before having it spelled out!"", never as a ""story so bad I saw the ending from miles away"" -- of course, as long as the rest of story stands on its own. (there are quite a few that don't...)

tl;dr: I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. :P ",t3_a5vats
