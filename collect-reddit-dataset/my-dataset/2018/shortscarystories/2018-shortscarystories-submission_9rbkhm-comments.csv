e8gbdx9,t3_9rbkhm,"Although dividing the poison between two candy bars will help make the flavour less pronounced (if you're using flavoured poison) - it seems like a logistical problem, as the kids would have to eat both candy bars consecutively or in quick succession to get the required dose for a terminal result. I have mixed feelings about the method.   

The story though - nooooope. Nope-nope-nope-nope-nope.",t3_9rbkhm

e8idojb,t1_e8gbdx9,"Could be an overdose in both, just in case they share or a parent eats one ",t3_9rbkhm
e8wl4dp,t1_e8gbdx9,"Well, maybe she miscalculated and no children ended up dying. I'll just choose to believe that.",t3_9rbkhm
e8g6jd7,t1_e8g5rk8,I think the narrator poisoned the candy so that she didnâ€™t have to be alone in grieving the loss of her child â€” her neighbors would be grieving for their children soon enough. ,t3_9rbkhm
