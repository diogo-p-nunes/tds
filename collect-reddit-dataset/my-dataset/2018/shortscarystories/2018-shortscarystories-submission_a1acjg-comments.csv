eaov094,t3_a1acjg,"Very interesting take on the ‚Äúoldest story ever written‚Äù.   I liked your writing style and the way you presented the narrator‚Äôs POV. Well done, I would read more like this.

eapgbql,t3_a1acjg,"I have to say, I was wracking my brain trying to think who the narrator could be but was still surprised by it being Lucifer. Maybe it was the title that threw me (I was expecting an alien or robot guardian). Very creative!",t3_a1acjg
eaq5tao,t3_a1acjg,"So wait- Lucifer is God, and yet his fall is discussed in the Bible, which was written 1600-2000 years ago, and is set before the modern day? Am I missing something?",t3_a1acjg
eaos7ig,t3_a1acjg,I would totally read a novel of this!,t3_a1acjg
eapppis,t3_a1acjg,"I started to read it from the main page and I thought it'd be another cheesy kinda story. It wasn't. That was a fantastic read and if I could super upvote, I would. ",t3_a1acjg
easu916,t3_a1acjg,"I LOVE love love reading stories about Lucifer and God on this sub, and this is hands down one of my favorites! ",t3_a1acjg
eat066b,t3_a1acjg,My page shook at 666,t3_a1acjg
eazmhgk,t3_a1acjg,""" I was God. I was all powerful, loving, generous. But now He has taken over. I know not of his name, only his intentions. **God is not dead, he has been replaced.** And as I was once a loving God, He is a vengeful God. I can do nothing. I must watch, observe from my place on this planet as the human race is eradicated. I am sorry. ""

This paragraph is the best! I Like it.",t3_a1acjg
eaonbbc,t3_a1acjg,"I wondered why the Christians have gotten so mean, racist and homophobic. ",t3_a1acjg
eaophza,t3_a1acjg,Whoa. This is my new head canon. LOL,t3_a1acjg
eaou9u9,t3_a1acjg,This is amazing stuff! Definitely one of my favorites from reddit.,t3_a1acjg
eapl29x,t3_a1acjg,This is the first time I'm hearing of it.,t3_a1acjg
eapznuv,t3_a1acjg,"I like it i like it i like it, but i think the one phrase per line thing at the end is a bit too long, kinda detracts frim the twist at the end",t3_a1acjg
eas87oa,t3_a1acjg,"Stop
",t3_a1acjg
eaof8nq,t3_a1acjg,Me too.,t3_a1acjg
eap0z6a,t3_a1acjg,"THAT TWIST ENDING
SHIT
you really got me oh my god",t3_a1acjg
eaphkts,t3_a1acjg,This had me gasping audibly!! Well done OP! I love your writing style and it‚Äôs nice to see Lucifer‚Äôs POV ,t3_a1acjg
eaq0or6,t3_a1acjg,"Aw shit

Well, thanks for the help while you could I guess",t3_a1acjg
earztag,t3_a1acjg,"It scared me, I feel like it's quite real.",t3_a1acjg

easa2jv,t3_a1acjg,"Excellent, very well done! ",t3_a1acjg
eb65m29,t3_a1acjg,LOVED IT!,t3_a1acjg
egj6mba,t3_a1acjg,"Awww. I like ""Nice Luci"" stories. Reminds me of ""pure evil bastard Lucifer from Supernatural's"" sob story. He claimed he was the bestest thing ever and only wanted the world to be paradise, blahblah, but he was really an asshole who wanted to destroy everything because Daddy had another kid and paid more attention to the ""new baby"" at one point than Lucifer. Yeah. Nice Lucifer better than lying ass Lucifer. 

&#x200B;

I would totally read this Bible.",t3_a1acjg
eaq6g8a,t3_a1acjg,Good to meet you! Humans are not worth existing so no hard feelings for your incompetence...,t3_a1acjg
eaph3dp,t3_a1acjg,"It's really well written but the cliche made me roll my eyes.

Good job, though.",t3_a1acjg
eaohm24,t3_a1acjg,"And how is this scary exactly...? It's just kind of a ""what if God was replaced"" story though it doesn't really make any sense. Lucifer was only just cast out of heaven recently...? So what the fuck is the bible on about?
Edit: It‚Äôs bad fiction. Even if you do suspend your disbelief it‚Äôs still not scary. Not even an original twist. There‚Äôs a song called ‚ÄúSympathy for the Devil‚Äù and a tv show about this kinda thing.",t3_a1acjg
eaonc99,t1_eaob3zm,You should read Memnoch The Devil by Anne Rice. It‚Äôs the story of Lucifer‚Äôs falling from his point of view. It‚Äôs amazing. ,t3_a1acjg
eaokizq,t1_eaob3zm,100% in agreement here. Great job OP! ,t3_a1acjg
eaoo7kg,t1_eaob3zm,I would 100% read this right before bed; and freak myself out to much to sleep.,t3_a1acjg
eao56tr,t1_eao1qqb,Even though I‚Äôm a religious person I always find the reversal of roles a very interesting story. Great job!,t3_a1acjg
eaonyre,t1_eao1qqb,"I got yer feedback‚Äî amazing. 

Wish I had better criticisms for the writers on here but all I ever do is let them know when they blowed ü§Ø my damn mind. And always in so few words. Best subreddit ever. Keep at it, you people are artisans of storiesüñ§",t3_a1acjg
eap4epf,t1_eao1qqb,This is a great story. One suggestion I have is to expand the conjunctions (example: I‚Äôm - I am). It will present the narrator as more ‚Äúgodly‚Äù sounding in the readers mind. ,t3_a1acjg
eap635q,t1_eao1qqb,"I like this a lot. It‚Äôs interesting too, because when you wrote about reversal of roles I immediately thought of Old Testament/New Testament and then wondered if there were some sort of ‚Äúterm limit‚Äù for god and I just really like your story that‚Äôs all.",t3_a1acjg
eap87x7,t1_eao1qqb,beautiful,t3_a1acjg
eapogod,t1_eao1qqb,"Great story. Loved how it was written, but one thing I would change is just stop at ""I am Lucifer, The fallen one"". It leaves the reader wanting more and leaves them with an eerie feeling, something you want with a scary story.

I enjoyed it regardless, would like to read more of your works!",t3_a1acjg
eaq7zpc,t1_eaq5tao,"In this scenario, ‚ÄúGod‚Äù altered reality, making it seem like Lucifer is the bad guy. That‚Äôs how I wanted it to come across at least but I made it a little too subtle I think ",t3_a1acjg
easq00f,t1_eaq6g8a,Seriously.  Humanity being wiped from existence would lead to the greatest reduction in suffering possible compared to any other species,t3_a1acjg
eaokxjc,t1_eaohm24,History is written by the victors. ,t3_a1acjg
eaolh5i,t1_eaohm24,"Look up suspension of disbelief if you're having trouble understanding why people enjoy something ""inaccurate."" 


OP is taking literal gospel, and turning it on its head as a lie. Using a universal ""truth"" and making it a lie that humanity has fallen for is a refreshing way to think. I would read more for sure. ",t3_a1acjg
eap2o2a,t1_eaohm24,New God rewrote the book when he took over. Your memories of it included.,t3_a1acjg
eaohvup,t1_eaohm24,I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt enjoy my story. Next time I‚Äôll try and make it religiously accurate. Bc fiction should be accurate right?,t3_a1acjg
eapmk0l,t1_eaohm24,"It's called fiction. Look it up. 
Btw, great job OP!",t3_a1acjg
eaoutss,t1_eaohm24,"You must be a real treat at parties.

",t3_a1acjg
eapb6r4,t1_eaonc99,Memnoch the devil is probably my favorite book ever. I love the vampire chronicles,t3_a1acjg
eaooppy,t1_eaoo7kg,Those are the best.,t3_a1acjg
eao59np,t1_eao56tr,Thank you!,t3_a1acjg
eb2y1yw,t1_eao56tr,Shit even since I am a religious person i enjoyed this!,t3_a1acjg
eaqseg7,t1_eaq7zpc,"Yeah, gauging how much the audience can infer is a little scattershot when writing. It's not like you can jump into someone else's brain. That's what beta readers are for lol.",t3_a1acjg
eaolrzs,t1_eaokxjc,^this. I love this this is exactly how I wanted it to come across ,t3_a1acjg
eaonybf,t1_eaohvup,You did great. I enjoyed it.,t3_a1acjg
eapjmyl,t1_eapb6r4,I think it was the first book that actually blew my mind. ,t3_a1acjg
eaomoed,t1_eao59np,"Even though I am not a religious person I still really enjoyed this. First one of these i have read in awhile, good hook of a title!",t3_a1acjg
