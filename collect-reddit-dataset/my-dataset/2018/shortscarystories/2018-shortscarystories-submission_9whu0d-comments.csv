e9kq3ki,t3_9whu0d,Story number two. its a bit meandering. Let me know what you think. ,t3_9whu0d
e9kqedo,t3_9whu0d,I want a book like this. I would love a book like this. ,t3_9whu0d
e9l5vnr,t3_9whu0d,"Not bad, but FYI, the NRA doesn't issue stock and isn't publicly traded.",t3_9whu0d
e9krfia,t3_9whu0d,"Good concept, but your sentence structure needs more work.",t3_9whu0d
e9kyt3r,t3_9whu0d,"I like it. Their argument is floored though, they're screwed. Doing any ""goodwill"" now that they know Hell exists is just as inherently selfish because they are not doing it for the right reasons, i.e. they will still go to hell no matter how much good they do from now on.",t3_9whu0d
e9kvtxr,t3_9whu0d,This was a really good story. I do wish it had a little more examples. And that it didn‚Äôt get a little rapey at the end lol ,t3_9whu0d
e9kz44e,t3_9whu0d,"Interesting concept. Kind of like a multiple closed loop story. Sentence structure could use some work, but really enjoyed how it was not a good soul who had the power. ",t3_9whu0d
e9kzp9i,t3_9whu0d,I love this,t3_9whu0d
e9l4p0h,t3_9whu0d,Thank you. Excellent work.,t3_9whu0d
e9l5a0w,t3_9whu0d,"I don't have anything new to say, but I wanted to tell you that I really liked this.",t3_9whu0d
e9m6zrv,t3_9whu0d,Wow. This was brilliant. You took an old trope (the whole Groundhog Day thing) but spun it out in an entirely different direction. It felt like such a complete story as I was reading it. This is honestly one of my top 5 favourite stories I've ever read on here.,t3_9whu0d
e9l19fw,t3_9whu0d,"The term ""infant"" is typically applied to young children under one year of age, before abstract ideas like ‚Äúpractice days‚Äù are possible.  May want to change it to ‚Äúchild‚Äù?",t3_9whu0d
e9mcefp,t3_9whu0d,This is just awesome. Thank you,t3_9whu0d
e9mchpr,t3_9whu0d,"I really love this idea. Would read a book and watch the movie based on the book, great job!",t3_9whu0d
e9mzsuz,t3_9whu0d,"This is a VERY interesting concept, I haven‚Äôt seen a Groundhog Day like this before. 

I think it‚Äôs better in short form as well, perfect amount of punch at the end. ",t3_9whu0d
eb1m04k,t3_9whu0d,After reading your newest story I‚Äôm going through your past ones. This ones great as well! Would love a longer version of this in nosleep. The idea is very original and super intriguing. ,t3_9whu0d
e9m2p24,t3_9whu0d,Good story. Had to read twice to fully comprehend because of the sentence structure though.,t3_9whu0d
e9m34xp,t3_9whu0d,"Only two weeks and this is your second story!? Good for you, op! Glad you decided to post a couple of stories. Looking forward to more. ü§óüòäüòÄüòÅ",t3_9whu0d
e9mgy5b,t3_9whu0d,"Technically if you lived everyday twice, and you lived to 80, then technically you‚Äôre 160 years old.",t3_9whu0d
ea13r69,t3_9whu0d,"Intriguing concept and beautifully executed, well done OP",t3_9whu0d
e9l75mm,t3_9whu0d,[deleted],t3_9whu0d
e9kqn7h,t1_e9kq3ki,I like it.  Well done.,t3_9whu0d
e9m8i0f,t1_e9kq3ki,Extremely well crafted and compelling. Well done. ,t3_9whu0d
e9moptc,t1_e9kq3ki,"I think its great and if you expanded on it , theres a lot of potential. ",t3_9whu0d
e9vuqjr,t1_e9kq3ki,[removed],t3_9whu0d
e9kqodn,t1_e9kqedo,"That is a great endorsement, thank you. 

i've been reading these subs for about a week and this is my second contribution. I'm enjoying chucking stuff in. ",t3_9whu0d
e9m8g4f,t1_e9l5vnr,"Haha im English, so i have very little knowledge of the NRA. 
I just needed a simple way to make money from a tragedy. ",t3_9whu0d
e9m8b7x,t1_e9krfia,"I think this is about the longest thing i have written since school, so im not surprised. 

Thanks for the feedback :)",t3_9whu0d
e9kzgm2,t1_e9kyt3r,"That depends on the specific implementation of heaven and hell and seeing as OP has control over their universe, they can decide what the perquisites for entering each are. ",t3_9whu0d
e9m2knc,t1_e9kvtxr,That was meant to show him becoming an awful person when there were no consequences. I have changed it to a murder now. Much better haha.,t3_9whu0d
e9m8k6k,t1_e9kz44e,"Cheers :) 
I haven't written anything longer than an email since school over ten years ago. I'm not surprised my sentence structure is poor. 
Something to work on.
",t3_9whu0d
e9nc8tk,t1_e9m6zrv,"Awww shucks, thanks üòÄ
Might try write another soon.",t3_9whu0d
eb88dkq,t1_eb1m04k,"Thanks, that's nice to hear :) 

&#x200B;

I might develop some of them into longer pieces. I only submitted a story because i was bored on a sleeper train and had read lots of them. It is turning into a nice hobby though.",t3_9whu0d
e9m8rvv,t1_e9m2p24,"Yer i need to work on that. I havent had to write anything longer than an email since school. 

Thanks for the feedback :)",t3_9whu0d
eb8832b,t1_e9mgy5b,"He is 40 when the story takes place, which is why his heart is 80 years old.",t3_9whu0d
e9lwxhu,t1_e9l75mm,"Ohhh did not know that, was only to show the guy becoming evil. ill make an edit.",t3_9whu0d
e9lwzuf,t1_e9l75mm,"Done, changed it to a murder.",t3_9whu0d
e9w41pd,t1_e9vuqjr,"There was a line that alluded to rape that I had to change yer. 
It was only to show him becoming evil. 
",t3_9whu0d
e9kr4yl,t1_e9kqodn,"I'm really good with basic ideas, not so good at writing them out into a story. I really see this being a grea story, if you ever decide to take it that far. 
I could ESPECIALLY see it being something big if the Pracdays act as if the previous Pracday happened, as opposed to the actual previous day. Sort of a ""See how the world would've been"" kinda thing. 
Either story would be absolutely fascinating and I'd love to read either one. ",t3_9whu0d
e9l87ru,t1_e9kqodn,"Please consider this an endorsement, too",t3_9whu0d
ea5cmep,t1_e9m8g4f,"You could always short the gun companies individually. Glock, Smith and Wesson, Colt, Sig Sauer, etc. that would make a killing after a mass shooting lol

Great story! The pracday word was annoying to visualize a grown man saying, but not many other words would work so efficiently I guess. Except Oneday. Then the 2nd could Today lol. Anyway, add me to the list of people to notify if you decide to delve deeper into it. I‚Äôd love to read more of it for sure. Cheers!",t3_9whu0d
e9m9hlb,t1_e9m8k6k,"Grammar/structure improvement is easy, it‚Äôs ideas that come hard. ",t3_9whu0d
e9m1jje,t1_e9lwzuf,Ok good to go!,t3_9whu0d
e9w6pak,t1_e9w41pd,[removed],t3_9whu0d
e9w842i,t1_e9w6pak,"I mean he still murders her in this version. The idea was that he gets used to there being no consequences for his actions.

He stops helping others and just does what he wants. ",t3_9whu0d
