e9knfwd,t1_e9k39oa,"Its a good question. When sexually mature female Lobsters shed their shells, they are naked and at risk of being attacked by other Lobsters but that's when they are usually sexually active and approach potential mates for reproduction... its a subtle hint/joke for those that know about marine biology and its meant to throw the reader off with the human analogy... but maybe its unnecessary and too subtle?
