echj2an,t3_a998br,"Not bad! I don't see how the divorced sister deserved the same fate, but I choose to believe she had it coming. 
You might want to edit the ""erly"" on the second paragraph, BTW. ",t3_a998br
echekz6,t3_a998br,"As always, this text was originally written in german and then translated. If you find any typos, strange wordings or other mistakes, please comment below.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone.",t3_a998br
ecif719,t3_a998br,"I like it. 

One correction- “made a dinghy through the garage” 
The word “dinghy” means a type of small boat. I think you mean something more like “made a detour through the garage”",t3_a998br
ecjd9gc,t3_a998br,"It gets the point across fine but possibly a rewording of the last sentence? It seems a bit overworded and bumbly. Maybe ""I cannot forgive, but maybe she can forgive me."" 

Aside from that it's very well written and gave me chills",t3_a998br
echjkek,t1_echj2an,"I was implying that she has beaten her children to a degree that made her man leave her and take them with him. That's why I put the ""raised"" in quotes like the ""falling down the stairs"". But maybe it was to subtle. I will take a look at it tomorrow when I have some minutes, maybe I can reword it to make it more clear. But thanks for the hint anyway. ",t3_a998br
ecifgq6,t1_ecif719,"That was a part Google translated. But thanks for the hint, changed it. ",t3_a998br

ecifm7e,t1_ecifgq6,"Yeah! No worries. :) You Just said that due to the google translate you would like any corrections, so I thought you’d like to know. :)

I really liked your story! I like the realistic human horror of it.",t3_a998br
eciglqv,t1_ecifm7e,"Yes, really appreciate the input. I heard the word before and also only knew it as little boat but I thought, since I didn't use any expression like that in the original text, that there might be a second meaning (like detour) that I didn't knew yet.",t3_a998br
