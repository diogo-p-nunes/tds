eczrrkd,t3_abcroe,Kind of don’t get it can someone explain? Was it a joke?,t3_abcroe

eczs5e9,t1_eczrrkd,"The monster is fireworks. I guess the OP has seen firsthand the dangers of fireworks, and the catastrophic injuries they can cause, and so by referring to them as the 'monster', it’s like a moral at the end of a story",t3_abcroe
ed048h6,t1_eczs5e9,Yes exactly! It's always quite a mess after New Years' Eve where I live. Doctors and paramedics always tell us it's one of the worst nights of the year for them. One of my old schoolmates has lost one of his hands to an improper handling of fireworks. And then there's the people who throw them at kids and paramedics or cops. ,t3_abcroe
