ecffd4s,t3_a8w10y,"I love your ear for alliteration. Silence these souls, melodies merge, symphony of shape and sound and scent.

Great work on paragraph 4. Lots of writers have described synesthesia in poetic terms, yet you managed to impress with the imagery without getting too vivid for the tone of the story.

Well done! Very creepy",t3_a8w10y
eceupmz,t3_a8w10y,I am a synthaesite and i love this story. ,t3_a8w10y
eces3ar,t3_a8w10y,Umm so you‚Äôre Death? ,t3_a8w10y
ecesyb6,t3_a8w10y,Loved this! Thank you for sharing ,t3_a8w10y

ecg1snk,t3_a8w10y,"as someone with synesthesia, this freaks me the fuck out. i haven‚Äôt met too many people whose colors run me off the wrong way, but when i do, you bet your ass i‚Äôm outta there in a split second.",t3_a8w10y
echx3hv,t3_a8w10y,This is good. :D,t3_a8w10y
ecerlo8,t1_ecer5p5,Hopefully the person you met dealt with the news more pleasantly than my narrator,t3_a8w10y
ecf3au1,t1_ecer5p5,A question: Do you taste the sounds or do you smell them? I.e. Did their voice smell like blood or did their voice taste like blood?,t3_a8w10y

ecevcc8,t1_eceupmz,Glad to hear you enjoyed it! ,t3_a8w10y
ecesd5t,t1_eces3ar,"I wanted to leave it up to the reader to decide exactly who the narrator is.

I tend to imagine Death being more likable though - https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/9s6t0q/the_wallflower/?utm_source=reddit-android",t3_a8w10y
ecetaeq,t1_ecesyb6,Cheers! ,t3_a8w10y
ecffwg0,t1_ecfdqi7,"Graphical synesthesia is the most common variety. In comparison, auditory-tactile synesthesia is exceedingly rare, but it‚Äôs the kind of synesthesia most people are familiar with. There is an interesting parallel with Tourette‚Äôs. Most people think Tourette‚Äôs usually involves swearing uncontrollably, but it usually doesn‚Äôt; involuntary muscle tics are the typical feature.",t3_a8w10y
ecfynu9,t1_ecfv3q1,Wow thank you! Apologies for the crappier ones I've written haha,t3_a8w10y

ecfp1rc,t1_ecf3au1,"I don't naturally have synesthesia but when I've had artificially induced (ahem) synesthesia, sound converted to smell. No sensory input converted to taste, which is probably for the better.",t3_a8w10y
