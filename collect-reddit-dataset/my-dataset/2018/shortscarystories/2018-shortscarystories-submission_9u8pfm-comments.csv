e92edhe,t3_9u8pfm,"This one was kinda rushed, Feel free to leave Criticism!",t3_9u8pfm
e92jcgz,t3_9u8pfm,"I like the concept - it'd be nice to have an indication of how the rogue admiral plans to begin 'domestication' - chemical manipulation? Invasion? Replacing our leaders with their own kind? Any option would potentially be unsettling if executed well.

There's some weird capitalisation and typos, but nothing that can't be addressed with a quick proofread, and that stuff tends to sneak in if you're rushed.

Tl:dr - interesting concept. Deserves a proofread and I'd like to get more of an implication as to what our extra terrestrial manipulators have in mind for our species ",t3_9u8pfm
e94cddb,t3_9u8pfm,"I'm a huge sucker for this kind of story. Even if rushed, you wrote it really well and I would love to read more. ",t3_9u8pfm
e92lqi5,t1_e92jcgz,"Thanks man, I'll get the grammar soon enough.",t3_9u8pfm
e950fkt,t1_e94cddb,"Thanks alot man, I've always been into this sort of stuff as well. Who doesn't like the perspective of a villain?",t3_9u8pfm
e950ix7,t1_e950fkt,"What I mean, specifically is the idea of a superior alien race treating humanity like a pet or a science experiment. It gives me chills and makes me happy.",t3_9u8pfm
e9535dl,t1_e950ix7,"Ah I see, I like that theme as long as it isn't the whole overplayed ""What if were an alien kids project and he got a C- on it"" trope. I like it when these alien lifeforms interact instead of being outside of our reach, the only thing that gets a pass is Lovecraftian horror",t3_9u8pfm
e972oty,t1_e9535dl,"Exactly. The trope you described is fun, but I love the deeper aspect of interaction with our protectors/creators/oppressors.",t3_9u8pfm
