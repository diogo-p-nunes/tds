e8bqx05,t3_9qtxj1,This is my first post on this subreddit. I hope I did good. ,t3_9qtxj1
e8cs7md,t3_9qtxj1,You did good! ,t3_9qtxj1
e8e0b72,t3_9qtxj1,"It could use a little formatting into paragraphs, but it gets the job done, telling the story. I can imagine that sort of madness, but I can't exactly relate to it.

I have a different sort of Writer's Block, the one where I know I have to write more, but it just seems so hard, such a chore, and I find any little distraction to get out of it. (I particularly detest revising.) When I do write, the words flow, but there seems to be a limited quantity. Once I've emptied the tank, I'm done. I have a friend who spent the whole first day of NaNo writing and ended up with 23,000 words. She might as well have a supernatural gift from my perspective. ",t3_9qtxj1
e8cz676,t3_9qtxj1,"holy shit, i thought this was r/writing and was very confused for a moment there",t3_9qtxj1
e8d0krr,t1_e8cs7md,Thank you. :D,t3_9qtxj1
e8e0iom,t1_e8e0b72,"Oh wow. I deal with the block that I used in the story a lot. I've been trying for years to properly write my book, and every time I managed to write something, I wound up not liking it. This time it's been more of being unable to translate the ideas into a fluid tale that would take people on the journey I'm trying to create.",t3_9qtxj1
e8d0lcy,t1_e8cz676,Lol XD,t3_9qtxj1
e8d0s23,t1_e8d0lcy,but this was good! upvoted!!,t3_9qtxj1
e8d142v,t1_e8d0s23,"Thank you. I actually took a bit of inspiration from my own life and just made myself older and actually in a relationship, then made this new version of myself go insane. XD 
The book about the outcast who becomes a hero has been a project of mine since I was nine. I figured why not use details that are actually true, it feels more real that way.",t3_9qtxj1
