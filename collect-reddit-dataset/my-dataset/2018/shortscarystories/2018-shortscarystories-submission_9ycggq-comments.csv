ea0sfgk,t3_9ycggq,I'm shook,t3_9ycggq
ea0v820,t3_9ycggq,I thought it was about puppy farms! ,t3_9ycggq
ea0tzzw,t3_9ycggq,I thought it was rats! Makes a lot more sense tho ,t3_9ycggq
ea0vjoe,t3_9ycggq,"I knew it was about fishes by reading the first 2 paragraphs. Specifically 'I go to the left, I go to the right.' was big giveaway for me. ",t3_9ycggq
ea0ueyl,t3_9ycggq,"Love it! Maybe use children instead of babies though? When I read ""I kept my babies somewhere"" then I assumed it was an animal.",t3_9ycggq
ea1aecc,t3_9ycggq,I don't get that eating children part... What king of fish is that? Something in me told me it's going to be about fishes and that eating part confused me a lot... ,t3_9ycggq
ea0z3bc,t3_9ycggq,i knew it was about a pet straight away and even though it was quite obvious I still enjoyed the read and your style of writing. good job!,t3_9ycggq
ea0z3jy,t3_9ycggq,I thought it would be pigs! Fish are a nice twist.,t3_9ycggq

ea11zpl,t3_9ycggq,"I thought ants 

Very good!",t3_9ycggq
ea1chjm,t3_9ycggq,I thought they might be refugees.. ,t3_9ycggq
ea1fquu,t3_9ycggq,This is so sad. Poor fish. ,t3_9ycggq
ea1j26x,t3_9ycggq,brilliant :),t3_9ycggq
ea1x3j6,t3_9ycggq,Thought it was pac man and the ghost lol,t3_9ycggq
ea0zbm4,t3_9ycggq,I thought this was about chickens,t3_9ycggq
ea1rro5,t3_9ycggq,That escalated w the whole ‚Äúbig guy ate my baby‚Äù etc kind of fish,t3_9ycggq
ebkuaoc,t3_9ycggq,"Um, but aren't you aware the simple fact that fish don't get pregnant and ""give birth""? They lay eggs (ok, a seahorse is a bit different since the eggs hatch inside the belly). Should know such things.",t3_9ycggq
ea18c4l,t1_ea0v820,I thought it was about chickens who lay eggs in factory farms :(,t3_9ycggq
ea18v9g,t1_ea0v820,Me too!,t3_9ycggq
ea0zcbg,t1_ea0tzzw,That‚Äôs what I thought till the eating... then chickens... wrong again,t3_9ycggq
ea10pnh,t1_ea0ueyl,"I can definitely see why. I'll fix it, Thank you!

ea1ys4g,t1_ea1x3j6,"Hmm, Interesting take... ",t3_9ycggq
ea3fiqa,t1_ea1x3j6,Me too!,t3_9ycggq
ebl1ba4,t1_ebkuaoc,I wanted to try to make it seem less obvious to the reader. I appreciate the feedback! ,t3_9ycggq
ec2vn40,t1_ebkuaoc,"Tons of fish give live birth. In fact, most common hobby fish that would be abused by a new keeper are live-bearers. They technically do produce eggs, but they keep them inside their body until the fry (baby fish!) hatch and swim out of their mommy.

And seahorses are live-bearers in the same exact way, aside from the fact that the male seahorse is the one who holds the eggs inside him until they hatch.

Really neat story OP! It's cool to see people acknowledge the suffering of creatures so different from us, and it's nicely written too.",t3_9ycggq
ea2j102,t1_ea18c4l,It really does not recommend us as a species that two examples immediately came to mind.,t3_9ycggq
ea1gjb9,t1_ea1c4uh,"Ok, I know if you have guppy, that can give birth to life fry and this is mostly used as lifr food for other fishes... And also that other fish can consume new born fry, but in story, there is: big guy ate my children. 
Is it about another fish or is she talking about human? That's what confuses me. ",t3_9ycggq
ea30f8n,t1_ea2j102,"I recommend the short story ‚ÄúBeyond Lies the Wub‚Äù, similar theme as our thoughts here :)",t3_9ycggq
ea2p8xz,t1_ea1gjb9,"""Big guy"" refers to another fish. ""Scary guy""/""captor"" is the human owner.",t3_9ycggq
ea3cm18,t1_ea2p8xz,"Ok, now it make sense, thank you. ",t3_9ycggq
