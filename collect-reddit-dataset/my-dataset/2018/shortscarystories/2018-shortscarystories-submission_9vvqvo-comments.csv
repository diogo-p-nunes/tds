e9gu01p,t3_9vvqvo,"> “I am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled by fog where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were once my arms; bulks rounding down into legless humps of soft slippery matter. I leave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of diseased, evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within. Outwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been known as human, a thing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague resemblance. Inwardly: alone.”

— *I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream*",t3_9vvqvo
ejb2cym,t3_9vvqvo,This has vibes of “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” which is one of the most haunting short stories I’ve ever read. Well done. ,t3_9vvqvo

e9gtq98,t3_9vvqvo,"Why won’t they replace your failing parts with artificial ones? If they don’t want to harm you, and will obey your commands, wouldn’t they be okay with replacing dead parts with artificial parts if you, a human, insisted it was helping not hurting you? You would think they would still want to help humanity, but I guess if they see cutting gangrenous parts off as helping they may not think you need them?",t3_9vvqvo

Asimov's laws mean that you can't order a robot to harm another human - in this imagining of those laws, the machines apply that law to everyone, including to the human giving the order - you can't order them to kill you as it would violate the most basic principle programmed into them ",t3_9vvqvo
