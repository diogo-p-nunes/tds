ecavfby,t3_a8i8am,This reminds me of a nightmare a couple days ago in which I just woke up at 3am and saw a man in front of me. I pinched myself and was like oh shit I ainâ€™t dreaming and then I ask who are you? And the fucker smiles and disappears... I had a anxiety attack in the bathroom ,t3_a8i8am
