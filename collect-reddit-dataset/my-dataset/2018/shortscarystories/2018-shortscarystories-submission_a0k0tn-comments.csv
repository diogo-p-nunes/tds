eaiicmi,t3_a0k0tn,The way you set it up really made Ken seem like a good man. Very good work. Didn't see it coming! ,t3_a0k0tn
eaiu559,t3_a0k0tn,"Very nice, great descriptions and atmosphere!  Good use of subtlety as well with the police officer twist at the end. 

The only thing that bothered me was the dash cam. Even wiping his prints from it, it’d be suspicious with the gaps in the recording especially since it would show his pulling over and discussion with Marla with time stamp of sane time as her disappearance. Just as one serial killer to another...",t3_a0k0tn
eaiez11,t3_a0k0tn,soooooo the officer is kidnapping everyone who drives over the limit?? XD  I'm not sure I've got this right  but it was  a good read nonetheless   ,t3_a0k0tn
eaj5tl8,t3_a0k0tn,Hate to say it but about a fourth of the way through I was already thinking “please don’t let the twist be that the killer is Ken”. Your writing style is good but after reading a lot of stories on this sub I saw the twist coming a mile away. I enjoyed it though! Good attention to detail.,t3_a0k0tn
eaij3ww,t3_a0k0tn,"Good idea, though it was a little too obvious that he was the kidnapper",t3_a0k0tn
eai9cc4,t3_a0k0tn,Amazing ,t3_a0k0tn
eajr1qu,t3_a0k0tn,"The whole daughter crying bit kinda gave it away, but otherwise you did pretty good!!",t3_a0k0tn
eaiv87u,t1_eaiu559,That assumes anyone checks and suspects. They've got a lot more going on at the moment than checking one of their own...,t3_a0k0tn
eaj9muu,t1_eaiu559,"I had assumed they meant wiping the camera memory. So if anyone looked, it wouldn't even show him pulling her over. No gaps, no trace.",t3_a0k0tn
eaif9lb,t1_eaiez11,Just be careful out there.,t3_a0k0tn
eaj14ue,t1_eaiv87u,"‘‘Tis tour story my friend, just pointing out what bothered me.  ",t3_a0k0tn
eaiv98q,t1_eaif9lb,...spoopy...,t3_a0k0tn
eaj4sja,t1_eaj14ue,I get it. :),t3_a0k0tn
eajf1md,t1_eaiv98q,Doesn’t need to be a reason for everything. I like to think it was random just like the victims.,t3_a0k0tn
