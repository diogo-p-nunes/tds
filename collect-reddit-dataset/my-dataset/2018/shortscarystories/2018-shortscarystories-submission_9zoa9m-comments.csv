eaaq0qt,t3_9zoa9m,"You need to MOVE!!!
Great short story, I loved it!",t3_9zoa9m
eab0ub1,t3_9zoa9m,I knew it would be a human but the way you wrote this still gave me chills when I got to the end,t3_9zoa9m
eaatgs3,t3_9zoa9m,[removed],t3_9zoa9m
eabzjj3,t3_9zoa9m,Delightfully unsettling.,t3_9zoa9m
eaclr8s,t3_9zoa9m,This should be a 28 days later prequel,t3_9zoa9m
eabi80w,t3_9zoa9m,Sadly this didnt have the most spine chilling effect on me.. However I do really enjoy the concept... next time I would add in extra little details to slow the story down and add suspense or take out some of the unnecessary details and make it snap into unpredictability as soon as you start reading,t3_9zoa9m
eac9ut6,t3_9zoa9m,This actually freaked me out. I got an instant hot/scared flush all over my body. Great job.,t3_9zoa9m
each247,t3_9zoa9m,"Yeah, we do carry a lot of germs. We're kinda gross like that.",t3_9zoa9m
eaqlxnf,t3_9zoa9m,Always vaccinate your pets,t3_9zoa9m
eabb96w,t3_9zoa9m,"What are the odds of a human having rabies opposed to an animal? Also if a dog is bitten by an unknown animal or even a known animal and is vaccinated being quarantined and I THINK given treatment. Is necessary. You put down unvaccinated pets.

Sorry...that was just in case you were curious. Great story!",t3_9zoa9m
eabww7l,t3_9zoa9m,Iâ€™m upset that you chose to end this with putting the dog down.,t3_9zoa9m

eac0y0v,t1_eabww7l,It may just be me but I thought OP left it to the reader to decide who was put down.,t3_9zoa9m
eabhfq3,t1_eaaq1o5,Who the what the fuck? Real? Idk... but holy hell that escalated quick,t3_9zoa9m

eaazujx,t1_eaathc4,"Assuming they took the dog straight to the vet due to the nature of the bite, you can still give him an anti-rabies right? Or does that only work for humans? ",t3_9zoa9m

eab30rq,t1_eaazujx,"Not sure, but I wrote this under the assumption that rabies is an instant death sentence for animals. ",t3_9zoa9m
eabff41,t1_eaazujx,"Rabies shots are preventative, since it takes longer to ""catch hold"" as it were, in humans.",t3_9zoa9m
eaboux1,t1_eaazujx,Have you ever read Cujo?  If you have magic Beam rabies that isn't working lol....aww I made myself sad ðŸ˜­,t3_9zoa9m
