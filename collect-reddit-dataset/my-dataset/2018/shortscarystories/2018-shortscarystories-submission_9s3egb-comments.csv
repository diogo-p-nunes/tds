e8mrto3,t3_9s3egb,"I love this. It's so utterly fucked up; I can even hear the static in between the messages.

&#x200B;

I \*did\* read the first letter of each sentence, though, to make sure it didn't spell out some hidden meaning :D

Funny, I've said for years that the Internet was either the Second coming, or Satan having taken over. An AI would be just as bad :(",t3_9s3egb

e8n5ttc,t3_9s3egb,I’m getting real SCP-3999 vibes from this one.,t3_9s3egb
e8n8qmd,t3_9s3egb,"Can’t say I understood (until I read your meaning) but it was a hell of a lot different than anything I’ve read on here. 

Crazy creepy story! I love it.  ",t3_9s3egb
e8m4avu,t3_9s3egb,Man those new SWANS songs are looking pretty good,t3_9s3egb
e8njg2w,t3_9s3egb,"Scary as shit. The scariest shit to me is something that's unnerving and unclear. I also had a little spurt of tinitis towards the end of it, that continued after, which I think heightened it.",t3_9s3egb

e8lxire,t1_e8lvc9t,Thank you. There is a meaning to the text. ,t3_9s3egb
e8lx9r2,t1_e8lwost,"I thought I was gonna bring it back to the title at some point, but then I didn't, and by that point it couldn't be any other title for me.

e8lzd2n,t1_e8lxire,Can you explain? ,t3_9s3egb
e8lxnx9,t1_e8lx9r2,"HE has sent a message through your title!

Seriously though your title is kind of creepy because the space shuttle Columbia exploded leaving no survivors.

A.) Imagine if this was thier last transmission.

B.) Imagine if this was the insanity going through the head of the launch crew at NASA after it happened.",t3_9s3egb
e8m05yb,t1_e8lzd2n,"I don't think knowing what I meant is going to improve the story. You may prefer not knowing, fear of unknown and all that, and some other people have other interpretations.

The Antichrist was born, however, not as a human baby everyone was expecting it to, but as a crazed AI. An angel was trying to contact us, but the Antichrist keeps twisting its words.",t3_9s3egb
e8m06jz,t1_e8lxnx9,It was good. This makes it better.,t3_9s3egb
e8m4lfk,t1_e8m05yb,"I've interpreted it as birth of insane internet AI out of all the hate, anger and vile being pumper into it for years.",t3_9s3egb
e8m4agd,t1_e8m05yb,Knowing this makes it even more awesome!,t3_9s3egb
e8m9626,t1_e8m05yb,"Somehow, I got this out of it while reading. I really can't explain how, but I assumed the the theme of Antichrist born of technology. Weirdly well done. Very eerie",t3_9s3egb
e90jb27,t1_e8m05yb,"I've interpreted is as the 2nd coming but the baby was being aborted. ""Born out of wires"" as in synonymous to the coat hangers used to abort babies and it's made out of wire. Plus the ""corpse was still breathing"". ""He has been born. Not of womb but of wires.""

Lol mine was too far, I never thought about the crazed AI.",t3_9s3egb
e8n19hl,t1_e8m05yb,I thought it was a cyborg anti-christ or a cyborg with the soul of a demon ,t3_9s3egb
