ecde7mi,t3_a8ptq2,I’m sorry but I don’t understand the ending? Brilliant premise nonetheless,t3_a8ptq2
ecflwco,t3_a8ptq2,"I actually really liked this because it implies that she was stuck there forever and once she noticed it would be terrifiying, the only problem is that it is very subtle",t3_a8ptq2
echz5pb,t3_a8ptq2,I think level three means there’s going to be wildlife out there..... ,t3_a8ptq2

ece3dw1,t3_a8ptq2,"It isn't really intended to be super scary per se, more like unsetting with potential super-scary implications for the character in the universe in which it takes place or for what happens next after the story ends. I think maybe there is a better sub for this. I don't reddit much and posted here at the suggestion of a friend. Please let me know if you're aware of a better place for this.

The point of the ending is just that the character expected to be able to tell the difference between the room's simulation and reality, and she was not able to do so at level 2, and then there is a level 3, on top of level 2. So, level 3 must be even more real than level 2 (and I have ideas for how this is actually the case), but from the character's point of view, the difference is not noticeable.",t3_a8ptq2
