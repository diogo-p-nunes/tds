ec3yn26,t3_a7lrnh,"Short and effective! Well-done, OP",t3_a7lrnh
ec4mybz,t3_a7lrnh,"Cats certainly know their things! I stayed at my friend's flat yesterday, her cat peed on my sheet right away, and became angrier when she decide to hand me a blanket while I need to sleep on the floor. She's leaving early for a part time in the next day, so she woke me up in the morning, let me sleeps on her bed and use her pillow and another blanket instead, just reminded me to put everyhting into her closet (so that the cat won't do anything further to them.) I thought that's easy but I was so wrong. When I wake up again, the cat's sitting quietly on one corner, the one that it can precisely keep all the blankets, sheets, and...whatever all under its belly. It won't move, but the owner has told me it doesn't like strangers to hold it, so I tried to talked to it nicely. I said ""good boy could you do me a favor?"" And it was the first time I heard a cat giving a clear sound like ""biaow~~"" I asked for two times and it gives me the same answer, which resemble the pronunciation of ""No"" in Chinese. From its compression, I believe it knows the meaning (and hates me.",t3_a7lrnh
ec4favi,t3_a7lrnh,Creepy. Now I’ll have to listen closely to my cats.   Good job!,t3_a7lrnh

efve2dt,t3_a7lrnh,"One of my cats has started doing that ""Hewwo?"" sounding meow when he's looking for me around the house.

It's only slightly less terrifying than the prospect of him laughing at me.",t3_a7lrnh
