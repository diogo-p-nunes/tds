ec0yn6d,t3_a73xoe,"Anyone else notice how she thinks, ""It's been a while,"" suggesting she's done this before?",t3_a73xoe
ec0a5fz,t3_a73xoe,Love it. Thought you were going for primates with the comment about the smile but cheetahs and a cheater was nice as well,t3_a73xoe
ec0y8ty,t3_a73xoe,I love the cheetah cheater thing but would have found the story more effective if he was locked in a different cage. Cheetahs are super shy and would be very unlikely to attack. That's probably nit picky though and I really do like the concept!,t3_a73xoe
ec11myz,t3_a73xoe,"I hate that I know enough about cheetahs to know the (little) likelihood of them attacking. 

But I love the wordplay.",t3_a73xoe
ec030fw,t3_a73xoe,Story number 7. This is the first time I have attempted dialogue. Let me know what you think.,t3_a73xoe
ec1pjxp,t3_a73xoe,"Good but I think the dialogue needs some work. No one says “Hey, pretty lady” unless they are 200 years old.",t3_a73xoe
ec17azn,t3_a73xoe,Wtf this was on my homepage and I thought it was u/two chromosomes until the end . Good story though,t3_a73xoe
ec0lis9,t3_a73xoe,This was so good! I love a happy ending :) ,t3_a73xoe
ec0yhbp,t3_a73xoe,"I thought this was going to end with a monster like Pennywise giving a toothy grin before going in for lunch. 

I don't know what's up with your formatting, but it makes the story a little hard to read, as well as take up 3 times as much space as it should.",t3_a73xoe
ec1l1mo,t3_a73xoe,"This is fabulous! The cheater/cheetah line is pretty clever--it made me giggle out loud. Great story overall--good pacing, and natural dialog. Keep up the good work!",t3_a73xoe
ec1ovml,t3_a73xoe,Love it!!!!,t3_a73xoe
eccyaok,t3_a73xoe,Yessssssss. This was amazing. Good for her! ,t3_a73xoe
ec0hy89,t3_a73xoe,"DAYUM, SIS SNAPPED! loved this haha",t3_a73xoe
ec06dq6,t3_a73xoe,I love it,t3_a73xoe
ec0hu89,t3_a73xoe,Delicious,t3_a73xoe
ec0jf4b,t3_a73xoe,Wow i loveddd this!!!,t3_a73xoe
ec0kwx3,t3_a73xoe,Love it. ,t3_a73xoe
ec14q4v,t3_a73xoe,A cheetah never prospers! -Zazu ,t3_a73xoe
ec1vnbf,t3_a73xoe,"What a nice twist, I thought something will happen between them . LOL",t3_a73xoe
ec3q3fd,t3_a73xoe,Good one.,t3_a73xoe
ecgt1x3,t3_a73xoe,Awesome. ,t3_a73xoe
ecxuvei,t3_a73xoe,Perfect ending for a creep,t3_a73xoe
ec05n5j,t3_a73xoe,This is really good ,t3_a73xoe
ec0bckn,t3_a73xoe,Did not see that coming! Well done!,t3_a73xoe
ec0cneu,t3_a73xoe,I liked it It was short but it was powerful the kind of thing that sneaks in the back of your mind days after reading it and then makes you shudder. Love it!,t3_a73xoe
ec0zl2h,t3_a73xoe,LOVE IT! Wish I could feed all the cheaters to the cheetahs.,t3_a73xoe
ec1no83,t1_ec0yn6d,"Yer I liked that line, it has a different meaning before / after you know the end. ",t3_a73xoe
ec0aaki,t1_ec0a5fz,"Thanks :) it also allowed me to say ""feeding the big cats is my favourite"" early on. ",t3_a73xoe
ec1fbms,t1_ec0y8ty,"Haha, I felt the same way. Hungry lions would be more aggressive. Cheetahs are so lazy. ",t3_a73xoe
ec4h0uo,t1_ec0y8ty,Yeah cheetah's are super friendly. Even lions can be more on the docile side. Jaguars or tigers would be more likely to eat a guy.,t3_a73xoe
ec13p10,t1_ec11myz, A good zoo is very unlikely to have four cheetah in one exhibit at that. It’s unfortunate their behaviour isn’t as practical as their opportunities for wordplay. ,t3_a73xoe
ecfghh2,t1_ec11myz,"Yer. I basically made the choice based on the word play alone. 
I've never actually interacted with any big animals.",t3_a73xoe
ec0711d,t1_ec030fw,"Well done, great job OP! No major plot twists needed :)",t3_a73xoe
ece4o78,t1_ec030fw,"Turns out that this isnt true. I forgot I did it in a previous story. 
You may call me a fool.",t3_a73xoe
ec1przm,t1_ec1pjxp,"This was my first attempt at it, so I will be working on it :) 

Luckily I'm not to well verssed in the language of harassing women :p",t3_a73xoe
ecfgl2l,t1_ec17azn,"Oh fuck, I thought i submitted this to a confessions blog........",t3_a73xoe
ec0lp2d,t1_ec0lis9,Haha thanks :) That was kind of the intention. Horror story that made people smile. That and starting / finishing with the same line.,t3_a73xoe
ec1zk49,t1_ec0yhbp,"So basically, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOUMIXbTM5U)? lol",t3_a73xoe
ecdlhnf,t1_eccyaok,"Thanks :) I was going for a happy reaction to a scary story. ""Give me a smile"" is about the story and what I wanted from the reader. Think I did well :)",t3_a73xoe
ec0i7p4,t1_ec0hy89,Everyone likes a happy ending.,t3_a73xoe
ec0bukw,t1_ec06dq6,Pancakes are good though.,t3_a73xoe
ec1rehi,t1_ec1no83,"Yeah, it was just enough dark humor, like the smile.",t3_a73xoe
ec0ack0,t1_ec0aaki,For sure! The smile thing just got me bc to my knowledge a smile is considered aggressive with primates mostly ,t3_a73xoe
ec074cp,t1_ec0711d,It might say something about me that I consider this to be a happy ending. ,t3_a73xoe
ecff24z,t1_ecdlhnf,Definitely!! So good,t3_a73xoe
ec0akbn,t1_ec0ack0,"Well i think its just that we call it a smile with primates, as they look so familiar. With other animals we just call it a show of teeth. I might be wrong. 
Its an oddity humans have really, as it being a show of aggression makes much more sense. ",t3_a73xoe
ec1raqq,t1_ec0ack0,"Great story! I worked in a zoo (No one on one with any  true exotics.) and the big cat I feared/loved with all my heart were the Jaguars.

They were smart, clever and frigging killing machines if they wanted to be. Yet clever enough to be good little “assets” and chill most of the time.

Growls and teeth showing are aggression/warnings in canines (you know wolves,dogs even foxes (not a canine but who gives Seven shits.) 

In domestic dogs (Not sure about wild ) which I worked with teeth showing can also mean fear, guilt and appeasement. We get happy when they smile and back off when we see teeth.

Sorry attention span of a ferret. My point is yes big cats snarl.

Besides humans are primates so her smile makes sense.

",t3_a73xoe
ec09rtb,t1_ec074cp,You're not the only one. ,t3_a73xoe
ec1r3nh,t1_ec074cp,same tbh but I loved it,t3_a73xoe
ec2kngp,t1_ec0akbn,We don’t use our teeth for fighting lol,t3_a73xoe
ec2l2om,t1_ec2kngp,"Speak for yourself, you've clearly never been to Essex!

Haha, no we don't. 

But you do get that 'showing all your teeth' makes more sense as an aggressive gesture than an inviting one? ",t3_a73xoe
ec2qj51,t1_ec2l2om,I only think it seems that way when you compare it to the rest of the animal kingdom that does use their teeth in fights. For us it honestly seems like you’re making yourself really vulnerable by showing your teeth. ,t3_a73xoe
