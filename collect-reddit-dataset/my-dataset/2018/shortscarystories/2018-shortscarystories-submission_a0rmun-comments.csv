eakv9oo,t3_a0rmun,I thought it would be that the dad was the one doing the killings and he was warning people in a teasing sort of way about what he would do and they couldn't stop him. The idea of it being his son makes it creepier because its like the dad was trying to warn them but had no control over his son. good job!,t3_a0rmun
