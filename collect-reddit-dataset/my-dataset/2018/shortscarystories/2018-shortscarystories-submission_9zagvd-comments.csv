ea7l9ax,t3_9zagvd,"Oohhh, I like it! Good storytelling and a great twist at the end! Good job!",t3_9zagvd
ea7pj9q,t3_9zagvd,"I should have expected the twist, but I didn't. You took me for a ride, Well done.",t3_9zagvd
ea7rm0z,t3_9zagvd,"At first I thought this was going to be a play on ""man's best friend"" and the twist was he was a dog. I'm glad justice was served and no doggos were hurt in the making! Good story.",t3_9zagvd
ea7xa1l,t3_9zagvd,"Wouldve left it at *How did he know that this is where I left his brother.*

But damn, I thought the bro killed the other bro, that double twist is supreme.",t3_9zagvd
ea7nra7,t3_9zagvd,:thumbsup: really good!,t3_9zagvd
ea8v2hr,t3_9zagvd,"The phrasing of “presumed to be dead brother” threw me off because it made me think the brother was going to come back somehow (other than being seen in his watery grave). Regardless, great story! Love that twist. ",t3_9zagvd

ea9nao2,t3_9zagvd,Everyone's focusing on the twist. I'm focusing on how the hell a rope and cinder block isn't a FUCK. NO. for you.,t3_9zagvd
ea7y6hr,t3_9zagvd,Ha! Got me there. Nice twist! Very nice.,t3_9zagvd
ea7z6rz,t3_9zagvd,Got confused first and had to reread it. Great twist. ,t3_9zagvd
ea97alc,t3_9zagvd,"Retarded killer. "" oh what a coincidence you have a cinder block and were going to the same place i killed your bro, nothing fishy here...except where im going.""",t3_9zagvd
ea844ij,t3_9zagvd,This has got to be my favorite story on the whole sub and I've read them all! Kudos! ,t3_9zagvd

ea9ga94,t3_9zagvd,But then why was he enthusiastic to go to the lake with him? ,t3_9zagvd
ea9gi42,t3_9zagvd,Omg. It’s been a while since I’ve read something so simple yet so effective. Well done and love the twist!,t3_9zagvd
eaipvxo,t3_9zagvd,well how did he?,t3_9zagvd
eaipwoj,t3_9zagvd,so the second best friend was just the brother ,t3_9zagvd
eaj81wg,t3_9zagvd,"In the first paragraph, I already guessed that the author was the killer. However, you did trick me in the end as I was thinking “oh so the older brother killed the younger brother after all that’s interesting” and then I was like “wow that surprised me” ",t3_9zagvd
eamni0d,t3_9zagvd,This is one of those stories where I want to flip a table and hold my head. Awesome twist,t3_9zagvd
eanmv15,t3_9zagvd,"There is always the smarter fish in the lake, n you are one of them. Good job!",t3_9zagvd
eazn4be,t3_9zagvd,"Big twist, I love it!!",t3_9zagvd
ebb7nn6,t3_9zagvd,But... hang on... why kill your best friend? I feel dumb.,t3_9zagvd
ea8w8qd,t1_ea7xa1l,I like the “when I took him to the lake” part. It ties the whole thing in with the title of the story. ,t3_9zagvd
ehwoxem,t1_ea8w8qd,"Its unnecessary imo. Stating ""how did he know this is where i left his brother?"" implies that he took his brother to the lake. Adding in extra details that were already clear (eg saying ""when i took him to the lake"") takes away some of the shock value of the twist. 

Dont get me wrong, its a great story, but i do think it would have been a little bit better if it just ended with ""how did he know this is where i left his brother?"", because it tells you everything you need to know. 

Either way, good story OP",t3_9zagvd
