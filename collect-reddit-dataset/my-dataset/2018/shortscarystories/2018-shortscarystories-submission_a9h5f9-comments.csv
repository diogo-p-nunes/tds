eclgerw,t3_a9h5f9,"A bit of feedback.  Good horror starts with honesty, if you're not being honest with your audience then you can't expect their investment in what you have to say.

Beef is by definition Cow, and your narrator is a professed cannibal so there's no reason they'd refer to meat that isn't beef as beef.  You wouldn't call a pork chop beef or a chicken breast beef.

Functionally your story here while being a bit short would do fine if you just took the two mentions of the word beef out.

Outside of that, it's not exceptionally innovative and is reminiscent of many many other stories already found here and elsewhere.

Keep at it though, everyone has to start somewhere.",t3_a9h5f9
