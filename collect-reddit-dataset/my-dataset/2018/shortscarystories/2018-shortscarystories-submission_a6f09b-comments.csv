ebuamqa,t3_a6f09b,"To the people who have never experienced something, the feeling of ""missing"" it is really non-existent, it's like me saying ""oh how I miss my tail"" and stuff xD the ending could've been better but the poem-like start was really good, looking forward to reading you again! :) ",t3_a6f09b

ebvoohh,t3_a6f09b,"maybe this is just a HUGE coincidence but this is kinda EXACTLY like the story I posted a while ago 'The struggles of being deaf', you can check my page....the ""I have never"" and everything, you've just changed it to being blind?? I'm sure this isn't allowed on the sub...",t3_a6f09b

ebubjmu,t3_a6f09b,I really enjoyed this. Thanks OP!,t3_a6f09b
ebv1g1g,t3_a6f09b,"to be fair, most people don't see the sunlight on their face either.

well, except if you take a mirror with you when you're gonna bask in the sunlight.",t3_a6f09b
ebuh21l,t3_a6f09b,"> I have never seen Sunlight shine upon my face,

Neither have I, You'd need a mirror and proper lighting to actually see sunlight on your face,

> I have never seen how my girlfriend looks like

This is a plus, your girlfriend isn't gonna look better in time.",t3_a6f09b

ebvr0is,t1_ebvoohh,"that’s shitty. i just looked for it through your profile and it doesn’t seem like a coincidence. either way, yours is better written. 

edit: looking back at this one with the consideration that you’d not miss something you’d never had, your story made more sense to me, too. ",t3_a6f09b

ebvpdbl,t1_ebvoohh,"Unfortunately as long as the author changes the content, they can reuse a similar story structure... even if it’s pretty much kind for kind.

ebww61r,t1_ebw342k,"Edit: After seeing OP attempt to rip off another twist ending from another popular story, I have come to the conclusion that this wasn't an innocent case of OP being inspired by a post. OP is plagiarizing. ",t3_a6f09b
ebw85fu,t1_ebw342k,"There's no rule against bandwagoning here since we don't have series posts. If I recall correctly, the rule on NoSleep is meant to discourage others from jumping in on other people's stories without their permission. In SSS, it wouldn't be allowed cause it would be considered a series post with or without author permission. 

In this case, I've checked out both stories and have seen where their similarities and differences are. Both use a ""List Story"" type of way of telling the story. I believe /u/wtfffamenah had a bit more of a grasp on narrative structure while /u/IWRITESTORIES12 seemed to go for the overt List style as mentioned above. Both use a disability as the focus point of the story. However, the disabilities are different and there isn't anything being copied word for word here so I cannot say there is plagiarism here. 

During this year, there was a trend of ""List/Rules"" stories which was very popular. All those stories were structured in a similar way and all of them contained a level of weirdness to them like an episode of Welcome to Nightvale. It was a nice little trend there for a while until it naturally died out. However, I never removed any of them for sharing a similar style because a single author cannot claim to own the structure of how a story is told. As mentioned above, I would consider both these stories under the umbrella of lists stories and allow them to stand on their own.

ebua363,t1_ebua1bi,:D it was a great story and i couldn't resist the temptation,t3_a6f09b
ebvqqz8,t1_ebvpk62,"Someone wrote a story called ‘warning: emergency alert’ and it became a staple horror story structure with many renditions.  It looks like the similar thing is happening to your story structure.

",t3_a6f09b
ebvqt4k,t1_ebvpii9,"He’s changed the content so he really hasn’t copied anything other than the style. It’s like Nike and Adidas both making shoes with their logos on the side. 

I don’t like it either but it’s something that is fairly common in the horror genre ",t3_a6f09b
ebvxnuv,t1_ebvqt4k,"Yeah I get you, thank you for responding though. Maybe the author will develop the ability to come up with something a little more original, using their OWN ideas...",t3_a6f09b
