ebli5hf,t3_a57xi0,"I thought Susan got caught in the trampoline?
Did you mean to write 'they found young Susan' instead?
Cause I'm lost here...",t3_a57xi0
ebli7bt,t3_a57xi0,I think this lacked a lot of detail and the last sentence was just confusing. ,t3_a57xi0
eblk2me,t1_ebli5hf,"Other comments also pointed out the error, it's terrible because one mistake can ruin the whole experience. The parents discovered Susan, not Jade. I fixed the edit.

I'm gracious for the comment and advice, you're a great help as I can be aware of these things next time! I do have some work being released shortly, it's more in-depth and exactly what you're in search of, hope you give it a read on its release. You may have more things to add and I'd love to hear/invite you to the experience.

Thank again!",t3_a57xi0
ebljvp5,t1_ebli7bt,"Agreed as in more characterization and detail.

A few other comments also pointed out that the last sentence was about the parents finding Jade, not Susan. I fixed the edit.

eblvqp2,t1_eblk2me,"Oh, that's not a problem at all! The concept was very intriguing, definitely had me wanting more.
I also enjoy how descriptive you were with Susan's position, while stuck.
It was creepy, but I was able to paint the picture.
Thanks for posting, and I look forward to reading your work :) ",t3_a57xi0
