ea9xtm8,t3_9zixns,"Its wonderful that you have such a close relationship with your mom! It seems like you're basically psychic during this, wow, true family.",t3_9zixns
ea9zk3k,t3_9zixns,Team work,t3_9zixns
ea9hx57,t3_9zixns,"That's a healthy way of dealing with your emotions, I guess",t3_9zixns
eaa2394,t3_9zixns,"When the two dishes' colors got specified, one mentioned as having nuts, I knew immediately where the story was going. 

Still fun!!",t3_9zixns
eaa7i9f,t3_9zixns,I liked this. Very cathartic. And you‚Äôve inspired me to kill my stepfather. (In a story.),t3_9zixns
ea9oy2o,t3_9zixns,Nice! 'Sweet' revenge ,t3_9zixns
ea9qr1p,t3_9zixns,"Way to go, Mom",t3_9zixns
ea9wlin,t3_9zixns,Yes but that kind of revenge alone is pretty scary. That mom is a devious one ,t3_9zixns
eaaem10,t3_9zixns,"This isn't very scary. Also, it needs more than just saying he's a homophobe. We have to hate him.",t3_9zixns
eaa0twb,t3_9zixns,"Great Scott!,",t3_9zixns
eab0pkx,t3_9zixns,I see that you got it from your momma *nods respectfully at your momma*,t3_9zixns
eabco7e,t3_9zixns,Eat shit Scott ,t3_9zixns
eachrht,t3_9zixns,"Mom, the gays are killing..... again...",t3_9zixns
ea9yhua,t3_9zixns,Nice story!! Love it,t3_9zixns
ebz3386,t3_9zixns,Scotty didn't know. ,t3_9zixns
ea9ukoj,t3_9zixns,I wouldn't mind killing a homophobe like that but that's just me...,t3_9zixns
eaao90s,t3_9zixns,Bye bye Uncle Nob Head!!,t3_9zixns
eabx3e4,t3_9zixns,"I had a feeling that the story was going to end like that, but I kept reading it! The vivid imagery and description was so perfect. You are a great author my guy, never stop. Sincerely, a hippie who hates reading but the story was too good to stop. üññüëæü¶É",t3_9zixns
ea9u405,t3_9zixns,"Bro this is a cool story but in all seriousness y‚Äôall, murder is bad",t3_9zixns
eaaeatb,t3_9zixns,Nicely written!,t3_9zixns
eaiq2u1,t3_9zixns,uncle scarn,t3_9zixns
eamfcvw,t3_9zixns,‚ÄúLet me guess you still weigh 350 pounds‚Äù ,t3_9zixns
eb01yu4,t3_9zixns,And the mother and son do a high- five freeze frame. ,t3_9zixns
egj9vmg,t3_9zixns,"Scott may be a homophobe, but maybe he would have come around? I don't think murder is the answer...maybe let him suffer a bit. Then save his life. That way, he'll owe his life to a ""faggot"" and might not be so homophobic! 

&#x200B;

I'm a lesbian so I totally get to say faggot...right? Or do I just have ""dyke"" privileges?",t3_9zixns
ehvvm3d,t3_9zixns,"As a person with a nut allergy, this story was simultaneously satisfying and gut-wrenching, because there is no more terrifying feeling than having an allergic reaction (which is extremely painful) and not being able to find your epi-pen. ",t3_9zixns
ea9nhd1,t3_9zixns,So he‚Äôs a big jackass. You really gonna let him die? Your mom helped you get revenge but you‚Äôre dabbling with murder there ,t3_9zixns
eaj88b5,t3_9zixns,Phenomenal. The epipen part is gold,t3_9zixns
eaanxtt,t1_ea9matw,See you in hell you fat cunt,t3_9zixns
eaenntx,t1_ea9matw,"""That's Scott, he's a dick!""",t3_9zixns
eab9wvm,t1_ea9xtm8,Thanks for pointing that out! That mother-son dynamic is definitely something I wanted to touch on,t3_9zixns
ei4s0me,t1_ea9hx57,Happy cake day! ,t3_9zixns
eaal00x,t1_eaa2394,"Up until ""The red dish is *not* the nut-free pie"" I expected it to be leading up to OP's uncle making a homophobic joke about nuts in mouths rather than leading up to a *brutal* figurative and literal murder.",t3_9zixns
eaa2fca,t1_eaa2394,"Me too, but you're also right, the story still was fun. Super well written. I love the last sentence especially",t3_9zixns
eabcpg2,t1_eaa2394,It was obvious and that made the ending so satisfying ,t3_9zixns
eaarmdh,t1_eaa7i9f,"‚ÄúIn a story‚Äù yeah, right, nice cover. ",t3_9zixns
eab4cjh,t1_eaa7i9f,Emmm.... Should someone call the police??? ,t3_9zixns
eaask84,t1_ea9oy2o,[removed],t3_9zixns
eb1l0vj,t1_eaaem10,"Seriously. The Uncle guy seems like he‚Äôs got some pretty negative traits (don‚Äôt we all!) and so therefore it‚Äôs cool to root for murdering him... hm, doesn‚Äôt *quite* seem to add up. ",t3_9zixns
echltdg,t1_eaaem10,This story has the homophobia.  I‚Äôm sure that the backstory is full of a rainbow of irrational hatreds.  I‚Äôll bet he‚Äôs even a 9-11 Truther.  ,t3_9zixns
eaa19qj,t1_eaa0twb,Well hello Brad! (Vigorous handshaking),t3_9zixns

ea9xr08,t1_ea9u405,"Really? We're on /r/shortscarystories, where killing, raising the dead, awakening extra-dimensional threats to the world of the living and much more are as common punctuation. We're gonna draw the line when it's killing one fat homophobe?",t3_9zixns
eaa89d8,t1_ea9u405,I feel like r/shortscarystories is an excellent place to showcase the impulsivity that lies deep within all of us - the things we‚Äôd do without conscience or logic to hold us back. The human potential for ruthlessness is one of the scariest things out there imo,t3_9zixns
eapey4y,t1_ea9u405,Murder's bad; and that's why this story belongs on this sub. It's not a sub about good things happening.,t3_9zixns
ea9s7q8,t1_ea9nhd1,We're on r/shortscarystories,t3_9zixns
eaascik,t1_eaarmdh,"Reddit constitutes an alibi, right?",t3_9zixns
eaat9px,t1_eaask84,"Haha! I'm currently under work pressure, so I'm up most of the times. So, I started writing stories to beat the stress. I also take small breaks and read some posts in between. ",t3_9zixns
ebb5ls7,t1_eb1l0vj,"Yeah, I felt bad for him, seemed like a happy guy who just wanted what he thought was best for Chuck.  Being a homophobe isn't cause for murder.  ",t3_9zixns
echm1m7,t1_echltdg,It just wasn't scary. No build up.,t3_9zixns
eaaz6xq,t1_eaasmx4,Yeah... you have a point,t3_9zixns
