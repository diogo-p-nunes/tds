ec59poi,t3_a7pdfk,I love how simple the language is (intended or not). It gives a sort of realism that adds to the creep factor. Awesome story ! ,t3_a7pdfk

ece71ox,t1_ecdii0z,"She was actually living out her Rapunzel fantasy, and hadn't miscarried. All that talking that the main character heard wasn't to herself, but to the girl she kept captive in the wall, which is also why she could hear everything, since she was inside the walls, hence them being ""paper thin."" Afterwards though she leaves her to survive by herself but she dies due to her hair not being long enough to cover herself from the cold, and the character hears her dying cries. ",t3_a7pdfk
