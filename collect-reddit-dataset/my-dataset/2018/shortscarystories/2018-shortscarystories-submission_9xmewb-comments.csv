e9xtn5a,t3_9xmewb,"It's nicely written, but I am not sure I fully understand hat is happening....",t3_9xmewb
ea3lsu1,t3_9xmewb,"Well-written and creepy (and original) concept, but I personally found it a little confusing/too difficult to figure out (maybe I'm just dumb?). I would suggest adding some more hints about the mother being violent/crazy, and maybe some foreshadowing. For example, a scene where the mother's in the kitchen chopping up meat with the cleaver, or something. ",t3_9xmewb
ea9xlkr,t3_9xmewb,"Oh, I think it's fantastic! Excellent work.",t3_9xmewb
e9yayi0,t1_e9wv57w,"The main character (the *you*) has a batshit crazy mom. Every night, she walks into your room with a cleaver and chops away at any exposed body part she sees. The only defense is to hide under the blanket the way little kids do.

She's been doing it for a long time- hence the missing toes and the marked up stand by the bed.
