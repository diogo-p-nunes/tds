fbz19nv,t3_ef7oo5,"I'm just gonna pretend Kris just wanted to make her happy and treats her well and they live happily ever after lol

But for real, this was great. Well written, flowed, and I did not see the mental patient twist coming!",t3_ef7oo5
fbyswhd,t3_ef7oo5,"Kris Kringle is another name for Santa Claus, so either he's really Santa,his mom and dad loves Santa or he's obssesed with German Santanism.

German Santa aside, great story. The title gives away that the child would not be killed by her dad, so I thought ""this will be a sad story where Santa gives her joy while her parents are deas"", but nope,got kidnapped by psycho santa. Atleast she's happy, and that's a good ending? Creepy though, I like it. Good job.",t3_ef7oo5
