f8rvmep,t1_f8ruscx,"Oh, come on! Thereâ€™s a mildly intriguing setup that includes a mystery caller that wonâ€™t leave a message, an unexpected late night visitor, ever increasing tension, a revelation of a childhood love story, features an Ouija Board, concludes with a satisfying messages about the future from the beyond(!!) trope, itâ€™s about a possible murder - just kidding, itâ€™s about an actually murder completely based in reality, it fits in a perfectly packaged 500 words, and itâ€™s like a week or two too late to catch that meme train so it definitely canâ€™t be considered funny. 

Weâ€™re living in a horror story, fjondiscord, my friend. If all that isnâ€™t creepy enough for you, perhaps you missed the hidden message? Go back and read the first letter of each sentence in each of those four paragraphs, then tell me if you still donâ€™t believe.

No?

Not even a eye roll?
