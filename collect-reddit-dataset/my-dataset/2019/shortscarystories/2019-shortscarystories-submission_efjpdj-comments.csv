Story was confusing, until I realized that by the sixth paragraph, the narrator changed from someone to Annie.

Really sad, and scary. This sort of thing can happen in real life. This is why I'm terrified of going into dark alleyway. No matter how civilised your country is, there's always a chance someone insane is waiting for you in the darkness, with unknown intention. Good story.",t3_efjpdj
