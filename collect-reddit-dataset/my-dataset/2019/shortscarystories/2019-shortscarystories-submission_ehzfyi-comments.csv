fcmii6e,t3_ehzfyi,"I knew it. Proverbs are evil and turns people into bad person.

My bad experience with proverbs aside, good story. As someone who has been bullied, and suffer the punishment of fighting my bullies, I relate to this story. For some people, they're taught that doing a misdeed toward somebody that wronged them is a bad thing to do, but sometime people snap under the weight of all those bad things. and this story is very realistic in that sense.

 I also love how the sentence ""But that's wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right."" is repeated throughout the story, giving the reader that unsettling feeling that the narrator won't follow that rules much longer. Very scary and sad, as these kind of thing happens in real life. Nice one.",t3_ehzfyi
