f8636uj,t3_dz0tu7,"Talk about low budget trap doors, no put traps or darts... I'm outta here!",t3_dz0tu7
f85iakm,t3_dz0tu7,I'm confused about what happened though. Like were you talking to a ghost this whole time or did she have that room so she could kill herself when you weren't looking or what?? I need more information,t3_dz0tu7
f85vm0j,t3_dz0tu7,This is why I prefer horror stories in short form. Well done.,t3_dz0tu7

f8s86n9,t3_dz0tu7,"It's cool, that's the doppelganger. OP's mom won the battle but didn't know what to do with the body, so there you have it.  Everything worked out in the end",t3_dz0tu7

f86pzcq,t1_f84p7vz,Ooh I love a good mother son story of friskiness,t3_dz0tu7
f874eai,t1_f84p7vz,Then the OP would've need to explain how did they survive that scenario to write this? I think OP made the right call ending it soon else it would've streched long.,t3_dz0tu7

f85ocp5,t1_f85iakm,"The person in the home wasnt my mom for a week, thats why she had been acting strange. I found my real moms body in the closet.",t3_dz0tu7
f86sq5r,t1_f85xty2,I opened this thinking I was in r/raisedbynarcissists and was promptly confused when I got to the end,t3_dz0tu7
f8760y9,t1_f86pzcq,"""friskiness ""

didn't know OP broke his arms 😏",t3_dz0tu7
f876btf,t1_f874eai,"I needed the explanation, so I'd rather it be slightly more descriptive than it currently is. I thought it was just a suicide, got really confused, then wrote this off as a bad story. Other than that, I think the ending could be a little less blunt/cringey. Good story overall.",t3_dz0tu7
f860ybk,t1_f84oakv,"Btw, amazing story! Great work.",t3_dz0tu7

f87vjcj,t1_f87edxx,"Oh dude, it's not something to apologize for! It's just my opinion that this could be better if you made it a tiny bit longer. It's cool how you told a whole story in such a small amount of words already. :)",t3_dz0tu7
f86g8vx,t1_f868tk0,Okay then,t3_dz0tu7
