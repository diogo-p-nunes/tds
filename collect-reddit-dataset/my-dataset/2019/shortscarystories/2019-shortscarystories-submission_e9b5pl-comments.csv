fahxvoz,t3_e9b5pl,I loved this! I was fully surprised by the ending. It can be hard to have a short scary story not be predicted. Well done!,t3_e9b5pl
fai4to3,t3_e9b5pl,Not many stories here can give you that gut drop feeling. Yours did,t3_e9b5pl
fai8g4e,t3_e9b5pl,That was fucking good. Congratulations.,t3_e9b5pl
faif7e8,t3_e9b5pl,"Shit situation, do they have one or none left?",t3_e9b5pl
fajcj1t,t3_e9b5pl,I would never kill myself like this after the ending of the mist.,t3_e9b5pl
faiaupv,t3_e9b5pl,Very nice one :),t3_e9b5pl
faift27,t3_e9b5pl,"Oh my gosh, I normally can see where the stories are going, but that took me completely by surprise!",t3_e9b5pl
faiud3f,t3_e9b5pl,Whoah that was real nice. That twist in the end damn..,t3_e9b5pl
faiqima,t3_e9b5pl,this is so good omg,t3_e9b5pl
faiqp9l,t3_e9b5pl,Yes,t3_e9b5pl
faisdqf,t3_e9b5pl,oooooh shit this one actually did give me a chill,t3_e9b5pl
faj2pg5,t3_e9b5pl,I love a good short zombie story. And this variation where the undead have intelligence is brilliant.,t3_e9b5pl
fajbs7f,t3_e9b5pl,"Really good!!
I don’t know what you mean by “and the rest of the continent”, do you mean “the world” instead?",t3_e9b5pl
fajkcuw,t3_e9b5pl,Very nice twist!,t3_e9b5pl
faju4la,t3_e9b5pl,Nice! I thought the protagonist would've been a zombie himself?,t3_e9b5pl
faic7ok,t3_e9b5pl,"This is a great story. A few errors that you can easily over look, but definitely deserves more upvotes.",t3_e9b5pl
fajdsmr,t3_e9b5pl,"I loved it, especially the twist at the end",t3_e9b5pl
famzthw,t3_e9b5pl,"This swift but brutal kick in the balls that was phenomenally written rivals the end of the movie Seven. ""What's in the box?"". It rivals  The Walking Dead's ""Look at the flowers, Lizzie."", And it surpasses the Twilight Zone's, ""What ever made you think you were in heaven, mr. Valentine, this is the other place.""
All these gut dropping examples are on par with the end of the movie 'The Mist' & that long anguished scream, accented only by the 'click, click' of an empty gun. 
There are many examples of this polar  opposite of a happy ending kind of ending, but few are done really well. This story is one of them. Well done!",t3_e9b5pl
faiz44a,t3_e9b5pl,so good!,t3_e9b5pl
faj1n0h,t3_e9b5pl,got shivers at the last line oh wow. nice one!,t3_e9b5pl

fajgn75,t3_e9b5pl,Woahh..!!,t3_e9b5pl
fajif3g,t3_e9b5pl,Very nice work in such a short format. The twist at the end is perfectly set up.,t3_e9b5pl
fajj90o,t3_e9b5pl,I loved it. The ending was surprising.,t3_e9b5pl
fajqi20,t3_e9b5pl,"I thought for sure he was one of ""those guys"" that had been bit and didn't tell the group...",t3_e9b5pl
fak1slt,t3_e9b5pl,This gave me shivers holy shut thats good,t3_e9b5pl
faml37y,t3_e9b5pl,"this left me broken as fuuuck. great job, OP! so good!!!!!!",t3_e9b5pl

fbtqne9,t3_e9b5pl,This reminds me of the book version of I Am Legend. Well done.,t3_e9b5pl
fc65ts9,t3_e9b5pl,One of my favorite stories on here!,t3_e9b5pl
fcv5695,t3_e9b5pl,"Great story. Loved that the end was a twist but not a traditional twist, and that you had subtly foreshadowed it all along.",t3_e9b5pl
fjvk86k,t3_e9b5pl,I've been reading this sub's top of all time for an hour; this was the first one that really got me. I fucking love it.,t3_e9b5pl
fsot0xn,t3_e9b5pl,"Oh my god. I thought it was bad enough with only 1 bullet, didn't think there was actually none until the author's explanation. Devastating.",t3_e9b5pl
fajo323,t3_e9b5pl,"Short scary story, or long form gallows humor joke? I’m torn.",t3_e9b5pl
falun0h,t1_fai4to3,"I didn’t even know a short story like this could give me that feeling, I’m shook",t3_e9b5pl
faj28on,t1_fai8g4e,Thank you,t3_e9b5pl
faj28e0,t1_faif7e8,Its none. I had another ending in mind if it had been one,t3_e9b5pl
fakm6r2,t1_faif7e8,ooo i think one is worse. do you kill your loved one and get eaten alive (possibly by her).. or do you kill yourself knowing that she will know you lied and that she will painfully die by the dead (possibly you),t3_e9b5pl
faivn79,t1_faif7e8,None isn't as bad as only one.,t3_e9b5pl

fajo5lo,t1_fajcj1t,THAT was a brutal ending. They had a similar themed story in “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” called “The Gal Who Got Rattled” that’s a great movie if you haven’t seen it.,t3_e9b5pl
fal26os,t1_fajcj1t,Ending of Mist fucked me up.  Premature actions will last a lifetime.  DAng,t3_e9b5pl
faj24wn,t1_faiqima,Thank you!,t3_e9b5pl
faj25pv,t1_faiqp9l,No,t3_e9b5pl
fajodpd,t1_faj2pg5,"Doesn’t really make them zombies though, does it, if they have intelligence? I feel like “zombie” has certain connotations that go along with it, whereas you later referred to the “undead” which I don’t feel carries those same expectations.",t3_e9b5pl
faj25e6,t1_faiz44a,Thanks,t3_e9b5pl
fajk9m3,t1_faj28on,"Bro there's a small mistake, [instead of be you wrote bee](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)",t3_e9b5pl
faj8cqv,t1_faj28e0,Let us hear your alternate ending as well.,t3_e9b5pl
fanekya,t1_fakm6r2,"Its worse, but i thought they could stand head to head and die by the same bullet or something contrived like that",t3_e9b5pl
faj1wsx,t1_faivn79,None is worst to me. With one you could at least end one person's suffering.,t3_e9b5pl
fal5whi,t1_fajcj3i,Good bot,t3_e9b5pl
fbbc37d,t1_fajo5lo,That one fucked me up honestly. Just sad.,t3_e9b5pl
fbnc60h,t1_fajo5lo,"Oh that ending fucked me up. Great movie, but that short was by far the best one.",t3_e9b5pl
fajrg31,t1_fajodpd,"Well, o mean they know where to look for humans and they know how to search, not like they can speak or some shit like that.",t3_e9b5pl
fanej6l,t1_faj8cqv,"It was basically the same, but it ended in something along the lines of ""I hope they are quick with her""",t3_e9b5pl
fbbtwan,t1_fanekya,"Depends on the caliber of bullet. It may lose too much momentum breaking through the first skull if it's like .280 or less afaik.

Before I read the line about the gun, in my mind, the g/f wanted to be turned. ""One for me, one for you"" or ""one bite each.""",t3_e9b5pl
fjphtu3,t1_faj1wsx,"But the one who dies first dies knowing that they've condemned the other to a painful death.  You have a choice, and both options are terrible.",t3_e9b5pl
fbc2d25,t1_fbbc37d,"Yea, they definitely went off-road in terms of the theme of that tale compared to the others in the movie, but that kind of makes sense because it’s only one of two stories-the other being the prospector betrayal, which to me also seemed a bit out of tune with the rest of the movie, it was pretty straight forward, neat and tight-from the movie that were retellings",t3_e9b5pl
faqigfk,t1_fanej6l,"To be fair, since you left it vague, that's what I imagined. One bullet, and the guy keeping it for himself.",t3_e9b5pl
fjpow16,t1_fjphtu3,"Not if you don't tell the other person before you kill them, then you're the only one who knows you're condemning yourself to die a slow painful death!",t3_e9b5pl
