fba0g2f,t3_ec8e3b,No shit this was legitimately spooky and I love it! The part about them winking really carried alot of weight and really put the 'taunting edge' on the story,t3_ec8e3b
fbaeyd5,t3_ec8e3b,"fantastic one!

fbkc7pz,t1_fb9ts3k,"Same. I fucking hate mirrors, man. Like logically I know how they work and that there's no reason to be afraid but sadly this is still how I feel whenever I look into a mirror. Like something will pull me inside or choke me or be slightly wrong and then walk away.",t3_ec8e3b

fbaji4c,t1_fbaeyd5,To be honest I considered writing something longer in r/nosleep  . But I thought this worked better as a short story with more left to the imagination than something that goes into detail. Because then it goes from horror to something closer to science fiction. Just don’t trust the mirrors.,t3_ec8e3b
