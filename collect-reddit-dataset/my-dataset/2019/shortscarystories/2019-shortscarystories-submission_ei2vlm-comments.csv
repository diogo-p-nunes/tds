Horrible space pun aside, scary yet kinda beautiful story. The idea of being stranded in space alone is terrifying, and usually these kind of story brings along alien or some sort of terrifying space death, but nope, just him slowly waiting for his oxygen to deplete, while thinking if there is life elsewhere in this universe. Good one.",t3_ei2vlm
