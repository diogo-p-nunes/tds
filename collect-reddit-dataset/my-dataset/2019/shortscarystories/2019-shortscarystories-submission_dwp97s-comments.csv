This is very unreadable. I don't know if English isn't your first language, but either way, this needs to be re-written  pretty much from the ground up.",t3_dwp97s
f7kojfm,t1_f7kobnd,"Thank you for your comment,yes english isnt my first language..but I was trying to put it in a perspective of a kid,saying this story,with errors and confusions in his words...
I will take it down and re write it in a better format.thank you.have a nice day!",t3_dwp97s
f7kosc9,t1_f7kojfm,"Yeah dude it's not 'perspective'. This is _unreadable_. It's one massive paragraph with zero breaks, when someone is speaking is almost never clearly shown, everything is a massive run on. It's confusing and muddled and seems extremely poorly written. 

If you have a good idea, I'd ask someone who speaks English to ghost-write it for you or post it to a reddit in your native language. As it stands, I can't even say if it's 'good' or 'scary' because it's just a jumbled mess of nonsense.",t3_dwp97s
