fcj0wx5,t3_eheqef,"The people that works at night founds the term 'graveyard shift' very suitable.

Punny shift aside, good story. I like stories that ""rhyme"", since my mortal mind can't comprehend writing a story, let alone telling one while rhyming. The twist that the monater is the one narrating is good, and the whole idea of not going out after the Sun sets is really good, since people's childhood is littered with their parents warning on not to go out after dark. Nice one.",t3_eheqef
