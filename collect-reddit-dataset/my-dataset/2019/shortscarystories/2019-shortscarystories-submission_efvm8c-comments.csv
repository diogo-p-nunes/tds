fc2zfmx,t3_efvm8c,"Damnit, I couldn't find a joke. Anybody wants to help me?

No joke aside, a very cool story, and an interesting twist. From the word ""Daddy"", I thought that her dad is the one that'll be the evil one, but nope, it's always the little girl that is evil in these scary stories. Good one, I like it! And the ""choose who I name as villain"" and ""claim my throne"" is a wonderful line. Great one Bakn!",t3_efvm8c
fc392if,t3_efvm8c,"Absolutely love this story! 
I guess I relate to the girl, I feel like I would do bad things to people who hurt me.",t3_efvm8c
fc351i8,t3_efvm8c,"This story gave me a ""Dark Phoenix alternative origin story"" vibes. Really cool!",t3_efvm8c
fc30zs0,t3_efvm8c,"UwU Daddy tweats pwincess so weww 

(I'm so, so sorry)",t3_efvm8c
fc3pjew,t3_efvm8c,"Hey! Overall I liked the vibe. Hopefully this comes across as constructive: You use the phrase “...far more intense than rage” to describe her anger, but then you also use the word rage multiple times to describe it. Personally, I find this contradictory. If her rage is indescribable in its scale, then I think using various synonyms like fury, wrath etc. would help portray that rage is not the perfect term to describe her temper and strengthen the story overall",t3_efvm8c
fc3ji7t,t3_efvm8c,"I found the first half intriguing and your description is superb, but then the soul-sucking started and everything became edgy until the very last sentence.",t3_efvm8c
fc2y4ou,t3_efvm8c,That last line gave me chills!,t3_efvm8c
fc375yr,t3_efvm8c,Why is this here? I don't want it to be short. I.want.more!,t3_efvm8c
fc2op2m,t3_efvm8c,Awesome!,t3_efvm8c

fc3twnn,t3_efvm8c,Ooooh this lowkey reminds me of BrightBurn... I live this!,t3_efvm8c
fc413yu,t3_efvm8c,Great story. Don’t mess with her,t3_efvm8c
fc41lbs,t3_efvm8c,I wish I'd had those powers in school.,t3_efvm8c
fc43znk,t3_efvm8c,Very cool story!,t3_efvm8c
fc4jb1u,t3_efvm8c,Very well written,t3_efvm8c
fc4sb6k,t3_efvm8c,"I simply loved it... It humans who turn humans to devils with their uncontrolled powers...

And I guess everyone will agree with what happened to Beth who has ever been bullied in their life..

&#x200B;

I loved this write up.",t3_efvm8c
fc50fzu,t3_efvm8c,Please make this into a full story!,t3_efvm8c
fc5j23x,t3_efvm8c,"So gingers DO have souls, just evil, unrelenting ones.",t3_efvm8c
fc6jbzk,t3_efvm8c,"Nice.
The villain is more interesting and fun anyway. We all know  the Joker had better parties than Batman ever could.",t3_efvm8c
fckod1w,t3_efvm8c,"Damn you, you've revealed our secret that this is true...

You will pay",t3_efvm8c
fdio3g5,t3_efvm8c,"Ariel, is that you sis?",t3_efvm8c
fc3pu85,t3_efvm8c,"Placing quotes around ""it"" spoils the twist by virtually revealing it.",t3_efvm8c
fc3017v,t1_fc2zfmx,"Thank you! I was hoping they didn't take anything from the tension. I appreciate the feedback!

Regarding the joke... I know I'm going to regret this... but...

What happens when she walks outside aside from the circling crows and ominous clouds?

>!Ginger Hail!<

Please don't hate me if you clicked it and it ruined the story.",t3_efvm8c
fc39in5,t1_fc392if,"Thank you!

(nervous laughter, looking at the floor hoping I've never hurt you)

Your hair looks radiant today!",t3_efvm8c
fc37rai,t1_fc351i8,Awesome! I can totally see that! Thank you for letting me know!,t3_efvm8c
fc3323p,t1_fc30zs0,">UwU Daddy tweats pwincess so weww

Thank you... I think? 

I um... well... Now I can't unsee Katrina rapping....",t3_efvm8c
fc3pzg5,t1_fc3pjew,Thank you! That's very helpful! I hadn't thought about that line's affect on the other uses of rage. I'll definitely keep that in mind for the next go!,t3_efvm8c
fc3mydp,t1_fc3ji7t,"Thank you for the feedback! It's pretty insightful. 

I didn't want to say out the soul sucking. I wanted to describe what happened to Beth's body as she touched her. I could't get the language quite right that kept the energy flow.

I almost posted it also without the line about the fathers intentions. I had a longer section dedicated to the ""choice"" aspect of her father's warning about her temper tying into her rage choice bonding her to dark forces. It was far too big to fit in the size limits of the story. I hoped that I had found a compromise with the shorter language. I edited that section quite a bit trying to keep the energy flowing to the end.

I hope it didn't ruin the story for you. I'm still adapting to the short story format, so I'll definitely keep it in mind and hopefully get you on the next one!",t3_efvm8c
fc2yzap,t1_fc2y4ou,Nice!!!! Thank you for letting me know! I had fun writing it!,t3_efvm8c
fc38cj4,t1_fc375yr,"Thank you! This concept I've thought about a lot throughout my life. Beings with hidden powers living among us. What would be the reason they triggered their abilities? Would they choose to use their powers for good or evil?

I had a lot of fun fantasizing about this and writing it out. I can see this turning into a larger work. I'm not very well read on comics so I'd probably have to do some research on the different plot lines to make sure I wouldn't be using already explored concepts before taking it on.

I'm glad you enjoyed it! Hopefully I'll be able to come up with more for Katrina and the others!",t3_efvm8c
fc2qqeh,t1_fc2op2m,Thank you!,t3_efvm8c
fc55qzc,t1_fc4h7st,"Maybe Carrie’s twin sister separated at birth that was living with the father? Carrie has the pyrotechnic abilities and Katrina has the telekinesis? 

That would be a cool twist to spin!",t3_efvm8c
fc3uanj,t1_fc3twnn,Awesome! I have not seen the movie yet... so no spoilers! Thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_efvm8c
fc43rn6,t1_fc413yu,Thank you! That’s right!,t3_efvm8c
fc43t8w,t1_fc41lbs,Might be a blessing that you didn’t!,t3_efvm8c
fc44jk6,t1_fc43znk,Thank you!,t3_efvm8c
fc55reh,t1_fc4jb1u,Thank you!,t3_efvm8c
fc55vij,t1_fc4sb6k,"Thank you! I appreciate the feedback!

That’s exactly what I was going for!",t3_efvm8c
fc55yx4,t1_fc50fzu,"I’m definitely considering it! 

I spent a lot of time fantasizing about this concept, her and the others!",t3_efvm8c
fc6uiv3,t1_fc6jbzk,This is true!!!,t3_efvm8c
fckyw5t,t1_fckod1w,All of humanity will pay now!,t3_efvm8c
fc3q6f4,t1_fc3pu85,"Thank you! I debated about using them or not with it. I capitalized IT, but then all I could think of was Pennywise... I wanted to foreshadow a bit and build some suspense with the reader wondering what it was early on.",t3_efvm8c
fc305fp,t1_fc3017v,"I regret asking you to make the joke.

Just kidding, well done! That's better than all the jokes that I've commented!",t3_efvm8c
fc39ta6,t1_fc39in5,"Oh was that you looking through my window!? 
Thanks for the compliment. 

FYI, I don't think I'll actually do it. Hurt people. But if I stand up to my bulky and hurt them, do I become a villain too?",t3_efvm8c
fc3uyki,t1_fc3pzg5,Absolutely! I’ll keep an eye out for your future post for sure,t3_efvm8c
fc3ruue,t1_fc3mydp,"Short stories range from 500 words to the thousands, so don't be afraid to expand your story in order to thrive. There are other subreddits to post longer stories.

Yeah, I believe being subtle about the soulsucking would be the way to go. It all comes to how you use the words.

Practice makes perfect.

By the way, I don't think the story was bad. It just had something like two downs against three or four ups.",t3_efvm8c
fc53ezm,t1_fc3mydp,"""She gripped Beth's head with both hands, the girl's skin growing gaunt and ashen. Katrina then dropped the desiccated corpse""

Something like that maybe? Can be hard with the character limit though, I get that",t3_efvm8c
fc3b4pd,t1_fc38cj4,"Maybe you could treat them as parallel tales, and at some point you could intertwine the characters.",t3_efvm8c
fc441p8,t1_fc43rn6,You’re welcome,t3_efvm8c
fc5iwor,t1_fc55vij,Keep writing... Looking more of your work...,t3_efvm8c
fc30pxh,t1_fc305fp,"I enjoy your jokes! You always seem to find something positive to say on each story! It's definitely appreciated.

I first tried to write comedy... They said it was tragic. 

So I wrote a tragedy, they said that was horrific.... 

So here I am writing these. 

(I'm sure I heard the above somewhere and paraphrased it, I couldn't find the source to give credit)",t3_efvm8c
fc3a4ho,t1_fc39ta6,"Haha! Your welcome! 

Protip... in your world you get to name the villain. I'm in no position to classify the characters in other's stories :)",t3_efvm8c
fc3u5y7,t1_fc3ruue,"I've considered branching out to some of the other subreddits to go longer. I think part of it is the challenge. Even in my longer works I tend to use too many words and it can spoil the tension. I'm hoping that if I get better at the sub 500 word stories, it'll carry through to the longer works enhancing them. 
I could have left out the two lines about the ""father's choice"" I think the reader would have felt that she was the spawn of Satan or a different feel from what I had visioned in my head. That's probably the hardest part for me, that attachment to a larger plot that doesn't affect the short.",t3_efvm8c
fc5662u,t1_fc53ezm,"Thank you!

I like that line! This was actually my shortest story. It wasn’t the language cap on this one, I had another hundred words to use. For some reason I just struggled with that section. 

I think the last three lines were so intense in my head with her visually“coming to power” that I couldn’t get the language right to get there? I seem to struggle on ones where I have an emotional attachment to the scene.",t3_efvm8c
fc3bh78,t1_fc3b4pd,I hadn't thought of that. That's a great idea! I'll see what my brain does with that idea!,t3_efvm8c
fc31fks,t1_fc30pxh,"Welp, keep writing them then! I enjoy your joke and I enjoy your story! Next time I'll have a joke, I promise!",t3_efvm8c
fc3a8w5,t1_fc3a4ho,"That was well said! 
Keep writing, OP!",t3_efvm8c
fc32fqh,t1_fc31fks,Than again! I will! I look forward to it!!,t3_efvm8c
fc3abx7,t1_fc3a8w5,"Awe, thank you again! I plan on it!",t3_efvm8c
