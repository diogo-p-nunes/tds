fb8ga7s,t3_ebw3v2,"I like the idea of the spiders, though I'm not so sure I like the format in which they were presented. This was an ok read. You have talent, it's hard to make it feel like a 10 year old wrote it. It's just to much in too little words. Anyway the spiders were spooky, and you're a great writer. Keep up the good work, left an updoot.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8hix4,t3_ebw3v2,"I interpreted it as the man having some kind of hallucinogenic experience/mental disorder and having a break down, Daniel Boyle saying he can see them too as a placating gesture. 

I liked it, hope you do write more here.",t3_ebw3v2
fb9xjzs,t3_ebw3v2,"You did well writing this from a 10yr old’s perspective (my kids have written scary stories and had me read them, I often have to pause at misspelled words to sound them out and realize what they meant). The description of the spiders was detailed and elaborate, yet easy to understand and imagine them. I took the “bad man” was suffering from a mental illness, likely schizophrenia, and had finally snapped. I imagined the child who claimed he could see them too was the kid that is easily influenced and led that something is real when it’s not. Well written, I’d be interested in reading some longer stories if you care to share.",t3_ebw3v2

fb8gfx2,t1_fb8ga7s,"Honestly, this was probably the worst thing I've ever written. It was just a half hour experiment writing as a child. So I'm glad it's had a largely positive reaction in places I've shared it thus far. This is my first story submitted to this subreddit.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8humt,t1_fb8hix4,"Thank you, we may never know what Danny truly saw.

I may post more stories here, this first was to test the waters but mine tend to be a little larger. I'd have to write specifically for this format length (which this story only happened to be by chance). Either way, I hope you'll consider reading some of my longer form stories if you enjoyed this :) Thank you for your comment, honestly thrilled you enjoyed reading my work.",t3_ebw3v2
fba53nv,t1_fb9xjzs,Thank you so much. I actually have about a dozen or so longer form stories here on reddit. You can find links to them all on my writing subreddit (the link is pinned at the top of my profile feed).,t3_ebw3v2
fb8ege3,t1_fb8dyst,"Nah, the story just gives off the feeling of confusion. Aside from that, great description of those spiders. Really spooky and the text is a bit realistic too, like it was really written by a 10yo kid.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8gnip,t1_fb8gfx2,"Ah, well welcome to r/shortscarystories. Hopefully you enjoy it here. Experimenting is fun, but I never have the courage to post mine.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8ii8p,t1_fb8humt,Do you post your longer stories on reddit or somewhere else?,t3_ebw3v2
fb8en9e,t1_fb8ege3,"Thank you, the confusion is intended :) in some ways at least.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8gtkk,t1_fb8gnip,"I almost never write stories under 500 words so we will see how often I post. But if you enjoy my style, I hope you'll check out my longer stories.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8il04,t1_fb8ii8p,"On reddit, there's about a dozen already, at least. You can find them through the pinned post at the top of my profile.",t3_ebw3v2
fb8ktn0,t1_fb8il04,"Awesome, will do",t3_ebw3v2
