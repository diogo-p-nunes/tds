f7mib9k,t3_dwyth0,Wow that really got you happy and sad. great job,t3_dwyth0
f7ndtnj,t3_dwyth0,"Love it, but if it was really several light years away, it would take several *years* for the blast to arrive there.",t3_dwyth0
f7murnx,t3_dwyth0,I love this. Reminds me of Asimov.,t3_dwyth0
f7n494i,t3_dwyth0,"My god, that's bleak. I really enjoyed this.",t3_dwyth0
f7n53ue,t3_dwyth0,I saw it coming but this was very lovely and interesting.,t3_dwyth0
f7myanx,t3_dwyth0,Terrifying in so many ways. Great job!,t3_dwyth0
f7n9cgt,t3_dwyth0,I like Peter :-) Great story OP!,t3_dwyth0
f7n4k53,t3_dwyth0,I loved the James and Peter. OP are you Remus or Sirius,t3_dwyth0
f7nwo4u,t3_dwyth0,So who did you eat first?,t3_dwyth0
f7oflz8,t3_dwyth0,I feel the crew. No one was there to help them on the other side of the wormhole. There is only despair.,t3_dwyth0
f8xjmub,t3_dwyth0,"This is awesome, man",t3_dwyth0
f7ngic6,t3_dwyth0,"great story! I love science fiction when it's well-written, and this is very well written",t3_dwyth0
f7nrmja,t3_dwyth0,This is a great movie idea.,t3_dwyth0
f7moe3t,t1_f7mib9k,Thanks!,t3_dwyth0
f7nnq8x,t1_f7ndtnj,"Think it was several light *days* actually, though Im still not sure the math checks out",t3_dwyth0
f7nsude,t1_f7ndtnj,Yeah there's a lot of glaringly bad science. If he had made it a little bit more fantastical then it would be excusable. But that's not at all even close to how the sun would die,t3_dwyth0
f81vexx,t1_f7ndtnj,"If you read the story, it’s light days, not light years, but nice effort",t3_dwyth0
f7or3cb,t1_f7nwo4u,[deleted],t3_dwyth0
f7ogtq5,t1_f7nsude,"The story begins with a crew being sucked into a wormhole.

Scientific accuracy was never the point. We would die billions of years before it even ""collapsed"" and it would emit light as a dwarf star.",t3_dwyth0
f7nvrtn,t1_f7nsude,"Not to mention, if it was light *yeard*, would the explosion even reach them?",t3_dwyth0
f7osoj2,t1_f7or3cb,Aliens might still show up,t3_dwyth0
f7omm4u,t1_f7ogtq5,"There are just too many glaringly inaccurate details for it to be intriguing, imo. Unnecessary ones.",t3_dwyth0
f81voqp,t1_f7nvrtn,"But it wasn’t light years. And even if it was, the light from the death of the sun would reach them, or better worded not reach them when it stopped, yes. You can see light from stars in the night sky that are much further than light years away. If those died, guess what? After a certain amount of time you would no longer see them. Not sure what you’re struggling with here",t3_dwyth0
f7owvuu,t1_f7osoj2,[deleted],t3_dwyth0
f81vcxe,t1_f7omm4u,Like what? Not being flippant genuinely curious what these glaring errors are,t3_dwyth0
f82k6th,t1_f7omm4u,Like what,t3_dwyth0
f82e692,t1_f81voqp,"Wait, I'm literally dumb but it's still take days since it's light days but what I'm saying is that the *impact* of the explosion probably wouldn't reach them, still, I'm no astrophysicist",t3_dwyth0
f7owyt0,t1_f7owvuu,"Well... Everyone back home is dead, so maybe",t3_dwyth0
f82ixjb,t1_f82e692,"A) what impact from what explosion? 
B) at what point in this story does he say the impact of the explosion would reach them? Or even talk about an explosion/impact? He never does as far as I saw it, they can tell when the sun has died because they can no longer see the light from it",t3_dwyth0
f82j2v6,t1_f82ixjb,"I feel dumber now, thanks",t3_dwyth0
f82kb41,t1_f82j2v6,"It’s alright, in future if you don’t come in so strong and confident about calling stuff out, people will be less likely to want to correct you in the event you do make a tit of yourself",t3_dwyth0
ffbrhym,t1_f82kb41,lol,t3_dwyth0
