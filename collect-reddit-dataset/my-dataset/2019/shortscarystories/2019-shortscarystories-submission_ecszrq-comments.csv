fbfiv18,t3_ecszrq,"At a life defining moment such as that it is not only prudent, but needful, I say to take charge, look at the oblivious nurse and gently and with teary eyes say ""Bitch, have you not noticed that every kid to whom you hand this fucked up, spittle laden bear to dies almost immediately?! Get this sorry motherfucker away from me right motherfucking now! Or I will shove it so far up your ass you'll have to pick it out of your throat with a pair of hemostats!""",t3_ecszrq

Teddy asides, good story. Really like how Teddy is passed around the childrens, and it's not just focusing on one children, giving us hints that he is an evil dickhead.",t3_ecszrq

fbf1ihb,t1_fbe6l5r,"Thank you! I really liked playing around with the idea of a children's hospital being the perfect feeding grounds for a life draining spirit especially when its prey was already in a weakened state. Thankfully, it's not based on a true story. God bless all the children this Christmas!",t3_ecszrq
fbfakio,t1_fbf1ihb,I would sure as hell hope not! A true story of a bewitched evil killer bear. Hard pass. Great story!,t3_ecszrq
