f7z1u7a,t1_f7yz6vp,"Okay, thanks, I will work on that!",t3_dy7ayj
f7zzkk5,t1_f7yy84q,"Don't delete it. Keep all your work online (except if mods tell you not to), even just to see how you evolve. 

Imo, your story ain't bad but it lacks punch. It feels not enough. Nothing really happens, which could be okay, but you don't give enough of a fright. We don't get a sense of a special something that gets the fear factory running ; maybe not enough details, or maybe not enough empathy w/ the character. 

I believe every high-success story here has that little something that makes it real but unique : you can imagine the situation but at the same time it creeps on you and makes you feel things. I didn't get that off of your piece ; but I'm no critic and never wrote such a story as I'm describing \^\^   


Keep writing. I'm sure it will come.",t3_dy7ayj
