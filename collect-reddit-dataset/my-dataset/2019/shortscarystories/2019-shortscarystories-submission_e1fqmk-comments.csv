f8pvmel,t3_e1fqmk,"This is great.
Truth is, I think I could have been even better, but I cannot quite pinpoint how.

But it's a fantastic little slice of fiction. Great unfurling of concept, atmosphere, and chilling emotion within a very short space. Keep at it, you.

Edit: spelling.",t3_e1fqmk
f8ppq4p,t3_e1fqmk,Love this <3,t3_e1fqmk
f8qq2ps,t3_e1fqmk,"First off,excellent bit of a story, I like it very much.  Second,the timing was unreal!  I was home,alone, filing papers in my basement.  The T.V. was on in other room,but volume was nearly off,in other words,I could hear voices,but barely...but that's not the creepy part.  I heard 3, distinct,separate ""whoosh"" sounds. Like wind,but I'm alone,and it's not windy....I pick up my phone and there was a notification...to read this story...
I thought my notification sound had changed to the wind.I was unnerved,  
until later when I realized it was just a commercial on t.v. I hadn't seen before.  The noise track for ""whoosh"" sound on it is way louder than the rest. Happened again later,and made me jump a 2 nd time.  Now I've got the nervous giggles.",t3_e1fqmk
f8qdtca,t3_e1fqmk,Very well done!  I would like to know more about what the whispering wind wants.,t3_e1fqmk
