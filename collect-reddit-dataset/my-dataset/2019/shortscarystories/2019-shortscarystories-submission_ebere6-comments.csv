fb4bbjc,t3_ebere6,"I dont know if the story is brilliant on how self awere you are, or how you actually made the meta story of 

Writing a shit story about how people should not criticise your shit stories. Beside the nonsensical monster, set up, reason and the lack of fear, like to me you have the most important part that is to make original stories and self awere writing.

Now all you need to do is get better at writing.

Show less the monster, get a atmosphere going... This kind of stuff, 4/10",t3_ebere6
