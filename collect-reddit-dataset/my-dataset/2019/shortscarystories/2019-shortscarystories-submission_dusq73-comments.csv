f78ho7g,t3_dusq73,"This actually gave me chills as well, very well written",t3_dusq73
f78fscw,t3_dusq73,"Great twist, but not well implemented. If she wasn't in danger, then she could have stayed calm enough to just tell him there was a suspicious man breaking into his office.",t3_dusq73
f79dg4a,t3_dusq73,"This reminded me a bit of the old ‘babysitter/serial killer calling from inside the house’ urban legend, but with a new twist! I like it.",t3_dusq73
f78oljw,t3_dusq73,Ohhh good ending !,t3_dusq73
f7a29jw,t3_dusq73,Whoa! Very nicely done! Chilling!,t3_dusq73
f7ai86v,t3_dusq73,It takes a lot to genuinely surprise me but this did it.,t3_dusq73
f7bne5m,t3_dusq73,Great one. I didn’t see that coming.,t3_dusq73
f7agc4w,t3_dusq73,This really gave me the shivers. Well done.,t3_dusq73
f7agjmr,t3_dusq73,"My heart dropped to my feet, well done OP",t3_dusq73
f7au8mu,t3_dusq73,Betrayal sucks,t3_dusq73
f7b2lfz,t3_dusq73,"Interesting twist, I was waiting for what to happen, nice well done.

Although it stick to me that she could have been more clear, because she was afraid he could hear here over his phone line, but him talking to her is way louder. 

The thing in the hand of the intruder was what made her panic I guess, I was curious to what it was :)

Bringing up that the printing wasn't that important I didn't understand because that was obvious.

This were only things I noticed or stick out ot me, not me saying it was bad writing, because I liked it!! :)",t3_dusq73
f7b9ui7,t3_dusq73,Holy shit that was scary!!!,t3_dusq73
f7bavhk,t3_dusq73,Ohhh I like that one. Well done,t3_dusq73
fca33is,t3_dusq73,"When I finished the story the first thing I thought was ""Oh fuck."" 
And that's why I loved it so much! I like that you write in third person, because a lot of the stories I've read were in first, it's refreshing. (Not that I don't like stories in first person, you get me.) 
I read a comment saying that Chloe should be calmer and I agree but I can't say I wouldn't react exactly like she did. 
Overall I liked it a lot !!",t3_dusq73
fcb1yhg,t3_dusq73,That's fantastic man!  Thanks for the link too!,t3_dusq73
f78at8k,t1_f789na4,Sweet! Thanks a lot :),t3_dusq73
f79pnmj,t1_f79n4ot,"Yeah, in my spare time I fancy rewriting this. I can overreact but I guess I wouldn't drive myself to tears just seeing a bloke walk inside a building lol, too much!

Thank you re the twist! I'm glad I could surprise you :)",t3_dusq73
f788ho2,t1_f781g3e,"Thanks, glad you thought so!",t3_dusq73
f78icne,t1_f78ho7g,"Considering this is my first real attempt at tense horror, I’m overjoyed by this. Thanks for reading!",t3_dusq73
f78gbda,t1_f78fscw,"Thanks bud, and I agree. I messed up there. The original idea was to make it an unknown entity... a ‘thing’ as she probably would’ve referred to it as. Definitely more room for fear of the unknown to take over. Noted for next time!",t3_dusq73
f79pjzg,t1_f79dg4a,"You got it! I wanted to do my own take on that exact concept. ""What if the reader thinks the *caller* is in danger, and not the receiver?""

Glad you liked it, bud :)",t3_dusq73
f78wcsr,t1_f78oljw,Thanks so much!,t3_dusq73
f78h16v,t1_f78gbda,"I'm really impressed at how well you took that, since most people can't take any criticism for shit even if it'll help them get better. I respect your attitude.

Here's my suggestion; Have it be a stormy night, which gives bad reception, and thus her call is fractured and he can't make out what she's saying clearly and then the phone line cuts. It's only after 15 minutes and a growing weird feeling in the man that something is wrong in his office building that she manages to call him again with a somewhat clear signal and clarify the situation. 

The stormy night greatly enhances the ambiance and atmosphere of the story (Let's admit it, we all have a soft spot for stormy nights) and it also lets you get away with the twist you wanted in a realistic way",t3_dusq73
f7dk93n,t1_f79pjzg,"Agreed, that’s a classic. Ironically, my most favorite of all. So overdone in mainstream though. Hats off to you for spinning it into a new twist on an old concept!",t3_dusq73
f78i86a,t1_f78h16v,"Hey, if I thought my work was perfect I probably wouldn’t post it at all. Criticism is healthy. I’m no expert :)

Thanks for those ideas! I appreciate the depth.",t3_dusq73
