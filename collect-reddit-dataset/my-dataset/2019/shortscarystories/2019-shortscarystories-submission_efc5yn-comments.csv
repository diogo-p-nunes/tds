fc00h16,t3_efc5yn,"Abe and Sam then take a trip to Walmart and buy 2 Sledgehammer, destroying the wall beside the doorway. They all then live happily after while Be'laakrah quickly change the rules of his ritual.

Sledgehammer destruction aside, very cool story. Story involving ritual always fascinate me, and this one did so in a terrifying ways. Unlike other stories, Be'laakrah is a lot easier to summon, and since we know his name now, we could accidentally summon him in real life. Good one, although my room has only one doorway and I hate you and love you.",t3_efc5yn
fc1g68f,t3_efc5yn,"After Marty went through the doorway, Be'laakrah appeared and he actually turned out to be a pretty cool guy.

Apparently the other demon who warned them was just bitter because Be'laakrah stole his gf while they were in high school.",t3_efc5yn
fbzqtzb,t3_efc5yn,Damn that’s good,t3_efc5yn
fc0i5yf,t3_efc5yn,No windows?,t3_efc5yn
fc6mscy,t3_efc5yn,Wow congrats on the gold... and you've only been on Reddit for 15 days?! That's impressive,t3_efc5yn
fc0u61n,t3_efc5yn,"wait sorry, i love the story but the ending in confusing me. could someone please explain?",t3_efc5yn
fc0h9hn,t1_fc00h16,"You need to be able to pronounce the name correctly, so you're probably fine.",t3_efc5yn
fc0pshc,t1_fc00h16,"I spent so much time trying to think of a foolproof way of trapping the kid and ensuring the summoning and you took that away in one comment HAHA! 

This also made me think; what constitutes a doorway? Breaking down the wall may just EXPAND the door, thereby having no effect on changing the ritual. Would the house need to be destroyed enough to make it a completely open space so that it's no longer considered an entrance?",t3_efc5yn
fc1j5i2,t1_fc1g68f,I actually laughed aloud. Kudos!,t3_efc5yn
fc0q4xo,t1_fbzqtzb,Thank you! I wasnt sure most people would truly grasp the horror of the first demons warning but it seems you have and I'm glad,t3_efc5yn
fc0q16a,t1_fc0i5yf,"Nah, maybe his room is in the attic or basement or something. I couldnt add more description due to the 500 word limit so you just gotta be creative with it",t3_efc5yn
fc6qrb4,t1_fc6mscy,"I didn't (still dont) really know what to do upon receiving it since I'm pretty new to reddit haha. Was kinda surprised as well since this story wasnt as popular as some of my others. Thanks to whomever sent it tho, I guess!",t3_efc5yn
fc1tlub,t1_fc0u61n,"The ending was pretty straightforward to me (not trying to be a dick). 

In order to summon the demon Be'laakrah, all three guys need to speak Be'laakrah's name and pass through the doorway of the room (leave the room). This grants the demon permission to enter our world.

The first two guys do this, leaving only the third guy, Marty. Marty is fearful and hesitant but eventually he, too, says Be'laakrah's name and prepares to exit the room.

Suddenly, another demon/monster shows up in the doorway just as Marty is about to exit. It warns them not to summon Be'laakrah before disappearing. The appearance of this demon confirms that the whole thing is real and not just a game.

So the characters are faced with a dilemma. Because Marty has already spoken Be'laakrah's name, if he goes through the doorway, then the ritual will be complete and Be'laakrah will be summoned. But unless Marty is going to spend the rest of his life in that room, they realize that he is going to have to leave it eventually.",t3_efc5yn
fc0pv9z,t1_fc0h9hn,...I reccomend not trying. You never know when you'll accidentally say it correctly.,t3_efc5yn
fc0qmb2,t1_fc0h9hn,"I can't even say the letter ""R"" , it just sounds like ""Arrr"", so I should be fine :)",t3_efc5yn
fc5yzk7,t1_fc0h9hn,">You need to be able to pronounce the name correctly

Bay-lock-rah

Beh-lock-rah

Try both, tell me which works",t3_efc5yn
fc0qj4f,t1_fc0pshc,"If the house is destroyed completely, wouldn't take make the entire street an entryway? But hey, regarding the wall expanding doorway, if the demon wants to play, then I'll destroy the wall and buy a big green EXIT sign, and place it on top of the wall ensuring that it's not an entryway!

But for real, it's a demon. It probably wouldn't even care about what constitute as an entryway and just eat the trio of main character when Sam leave through whatever hole they'll make :p",t3_efc5yn
fc0q5fy,t1_fc0q16a,Maybe the room is a bunker,t3_efc5yn
fc1v2k9,t1_fc1tlub,"no xd it’s okayy, thanks for clearing it up. idk what was going on with me because it seems super clear. idk how i missed it.",t3_efc5yn
fc6r5y3,t1_fc0qmb2,"Shit, I forgot to mention theres a pirate version of this demon... nobody is EVER safe",t3_efc5yn
fc60xle,t1_fc5yzk7,"Well, now someone's doomed. Or is it damned? I guess it depends on what the demon does.",t3_efc5yn
fc70syu,t1_fc6r5y3,"Hah, you underestimate my ability to mispronounce thing! I've once say 'spare' instead of 'spear', so good luck killing me demon!",t3_efc5yn
