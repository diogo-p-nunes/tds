f89l109,t3_dzo8qw,[removed],t3_dzo8qw
f89wf6s,t3_dzo8qw,No it added. I was waiting for it to come. Very good writing on your part,t3_dzo8qw
f8b73te,t3_dzo8qw,"Oh god, I thought this was going to be the corpse of a child at first, due to the childish song, giggles, and tiny feet. 
(Even a living child being groomed would have been pretty bad, ffff) But this is still nuts!",t3_dzo8qw
f8br2vq,t3_dzo8qw,"Really good story, but that forshadowing was unfortunately a little ovious.",t3_dzo8qw
f8q92td,t3_dzo8qw,Nice twist ending!  Not the way I thought it would go.,t3_dzo8qw
f89wgcc,t3_dzo8qw,I just made one made “song”,t3_dzo8qw
f89jr9y,t1_f89dj62,Thanks. I wrote [this Two-sentence horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/dw23kf/i_was_massaging_my_girlfriends_feet_when_i_heard/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) a few days ago. It got decent upvotes so I expanded on it. Lol,t3_dzo8qw
f89v0mm,t1_f89uq8j,"Yea, this was a quick write up on my break. It is an extension of [this two-sentence horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/dw23kf/i_was_massaging_my_girlfriends_feet_when_i_heard/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). 

I wanted to foreshadow a bit, did it ruin the story for you?",t3_dzo8qw
f89tohp,t1_f89l109,"I just found that place. I didn't think there was a lot of traffic there. Someone said something like 90% of there stuff comes from one author? I didn't look to much into it. 

Thanks for the compliment!",t3_dzo8qw
f89y8a6,t1_f89wf6s,Thanks!,t3_dzo8qw
f8b7m46,t1_f8b73te,[removed],t3_dzo8qw
f8btdtl,t1_f8br2vq,The news anchor?,t3_dzo8qw
f8q97cs,t1_f8q92td,Thanks! I was worried I gave too much away.,t3_dzo8qw
f89ya8i,t1_f89wgcc,I'm not following.,t3_dzo8qw
f8b7wuw,t1_f8b7m46,"Seriously, on a horror sub? You would think that this would be the perfect place to find awful stuff like that--but then I looked over and saw Rule 8. Yikes.

Do you still have that Beauty and the Beast story up, though?",t3_dzo8qw
f8btemw,t1_f8btdtl,Yeah,t3_dzo8qw
f8b8atv,t1_f8b7wuw,"You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/duulcu/an_act_of_passion/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This is from r/JustNotRight. I like this sub, so far it really is the freest place to write I have found on Reddit. I'm hoping it blows up.",t3_dzo8qw
f8btl6k,t1_f8btemw,"I figured must people would get it, but that's okay. It was just a little quick write to get the juices flowing.",t3_dzo8qw
f8dbey5,t1_f8b8atv,"Ooh, thank you~ <3

I found all sorts of writing subs today.",t3_dzo8qw
f8mn89b,t1_f8b8atv,"So, I finally got around to reading that story~ I am glad that you earned a good grade on it. <3 I certainly liked the twist, which was something.

I am tempted to make fan art for this, as scandalous as that sounds. Perhaps we could both be crucified by Reddit, in that case. XD",t3_dzo8qw
f8bufoy,t1_f8btl6k,Oh i completely understand. It's still got all the elements I love from a horror story. You went really dark with this one and I like it. You've got some real talent from what I see.,t3_dzo8qw
f8mndvn,t1_f8mn89b, Please do!,t3_dzo8qw
f8buod8,t1_f8bufoy,Thanks.  I've got a few pinned on my profile if you are ever hurting for something else to read.,t3_dzo8qw
f8buqtm,t1_f8buod8,Ooh Ima check those out real quick. I'm on a reddit horror binge read right now lol.,t3_dzo8qw
f8bv8af,t1_f8buqtm,I hope you enjoy,t3_dzo8qw
