RPG aside, I hate you spectre for making me squirm in disgust. Very straight forward, with the flies taking revenge on the person that killed their friends and families. The description of how the flies is killing the narrator is very fun to read, and you can feel the narrator's delight as he is killing those flies in the first few paragraph. 

The whole idea of insects taking revenge on human for killing one of them is terrifying, since I am realllyyy scared of insects , especially cockroaches. But you can go swat yourself because of the whole ""fly crawls under my eyelid"" line. Good one, I hate it in a good way.",t3_ehghjt
fctd5ud,t3_ehghjt,"*""Fly Swatter""* or *""How I Started The Fly Apocalypse.""*  I sure hope this never comes to pass. I've swatted many a fly in my day.  But, how can you *not* swat those pesky (*buzz...buzz)* critters as they (*buzz..buzz..****BUZZ!!****)* **INVADE** your *very home?*  And they *(buzz ... SWAT !)* look *so smug* (buzz.buzz.buzz.buzz.**BUZZ!!**)  as they land near your food. EEWWWW. ***(BUZZ  BUZZ  BUZZ  BUZZ  BUZZ)***  What the...?   **AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH**  **(thud)**  buzz buzz buzz buzzy buzz buzzy buzz hee hee hee.",t3_ehghjt
