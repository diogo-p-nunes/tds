f9slyhp,t3_e6q96g,I’m watching Doctor Who for the first time and I literally just saw the episode where the moon was an egg just an hour before reading this.,t3_e6q96g
f9sylm2,t3_e6q96g,"Jokes on the giant space monster.  Without air to push against, there would be no way for it to propel itself to earth.  And with the reduced mass of losing its shell, its orbit would spiral further and further from earth.",t3_e6q96g
f9t4jqb,t3_e6q96g,"ok, so when I finished reading the story I straight up laughed out loud, then I started reading through the comments, and felt a bit weird, because it kinda seemed like people’s reaction to your story was different to mine, though it wasnt apparent at first, 

and then that’s when it hit me, I was picturing a frigging boiled egg the entire time

while everyone got the ominous ending of “oo a gigantic spoopy space alien was born” here I was just picturing this giant cracked egg in the sky that you would eat for breakfast

thats why it was so hilarious to me, cuz the whole time I was just anticipating this scary reveal, but somehow idk why at the end my brain was just like “yeah thats a boiled egg”

so yeah your story really *cracked* me up
yup, ill go to sleep now",t3_e6q96g
f9stost,t3_e6q96g,"I wonder what will come out of that, a baby moon?",t3_e6q96g
f9shkl7,t3_e6q96g,Waka Waka wah wah wah...,t3_e6q96g
f9swyde,t3_e6q96g,"Probably not going to be good idea, but why don't you continue this story on a r/creativewriting or r/nosleep? I'm interested in this!",t3_e6q96g
f9tyc88,t3_e6q96g,"Nicely done!  I've never seen Dr. Who so it's all new to me (and I'm sure it was to you also).  

I don't get the ""laws of physics"" critiques, if this is a crazy enough world that the *moon hatches a monster* then yeah who knows what happens next.  ANd I think having some levity in the story (moonpoop etc.) is a nice misdirection for the more ominous ending.",t3_e6q96g
f9te2ic,t3_e6q96g,"I had no expectation to what was going to happen but the egg surprised me. Not scary, but intriguing and actually really cool. I loved it.

EDIT: Are you a new writer? Fuck that, new writer or not, encouragement is much needed and appreciated. People being rude are doing it in an unpleasant way whether they're right or not. Your story may not be original but many things aren't (which isn't a good thing but it isn't bad either). Like I said, I didn't think it was scary but it made me curious and intrigued and hell that was enough to get me to the end and be pleasently surprised.

Please keep writing. Send me stuff, too! I would like to read more from you.",t3_e6q96g
f9tmgco,t3_e6q96g,"I'm sorry, I KNOW you probably worked hard but this is interspersed with so much humor that the scary bit is hard to take seriously.",t3_e6q96g
f9tykh3,t3_e6q96g,That was good.  Wasnt expecting the ending.  For some reason I imagined a giant space snake or space dragon emerging and heading for Earth.  Cool that you leave it up to imagination on what comes out.,t3_e6q96g
f9sxf8x,t3_e6q96g,"The story was a bit unnerving but not ar scary as I hoped. Some words such as ""moonpoo"" sort of threw the suspense off. Overall it kept me reading, seeing how nicely written it is. Part 2?",t3_e6q96g

Thw Moon: What, you never seen a crater before? Ass-holes.",t3_e6q96g

f9suam2,t3_e6q96g,"So that caught me off guard
Very nice!",t3_e6q96g
f9sj7gw,t3_e6q96g,"What a twist. It would be cool to witness something like that... Terrifying to see what comes out of that egg...

Is there a part 2??",t3_e6q96g
f9tezsm,t3_e6q96g,"Even if you did get the idea from Dr Who (and I'm not saying you did, I believe you when you said it was just an idea you had - a great one too!), I don't see anything wrong in taking that idea and writing your own story from it (loved the Poopy McMoonpoo part), so don't feel discouraged, you are a good writer :)",t3_e6q96g
f9ss6rf,t3_e6q96g,Was this inspired by doctor who?,t3_e6q96g
f9tc1uq,t3_e6q96g,Wippity wine this thread is now MINE,t3_e6q96g
f9tnawv,t3_e6q96g,"Huh nice twist, could be a horse.",t3_e6q96g
f9tonmh,t3_e6q96g,"@baybon Oh, I only meant that as a joke from reading the first line. I hadn't read the rest of that story when I made it, so it was in no way a critique of your writing. In sorry that it came off that way.",t3_e6q96g
f9trir0,t3_e6q96g,"I don't know why and it's kinda crazy. But for whatever reason, I found that more endearing than frightening. lol. crazy. still very good story!",t3_e6q96g
f9u0mzw,t3_e6q96g,"Yeah, it's similar to Doctor Who, but it's very well written and tbh, considering that specific episode, this is better.",t3_e6q96g
f9uvzrg,t3_e6q96g,Why do I want more,t3_e6q96g
f9vbj93,t3_e6q96g,r/local58 might be leaking.,t3_e6q96g

f9x9u6e,t3_e6q96g,"Yoo exept for the egg thing, this is giving me some serious Don't Escape 4 Days In A Wasteland vibes",t3_e6q96g
f9y1k40,t3_e6q96g,Amazing work! Nice little plot twist at the end! :),t3_e6q96g
fad4ajf,t3_e6q96g,"It's minor, but Space X is not an entity that does astronomy. They're a commercial rocket company that launches objects to near earth orbit (and maybe beyond in the future). ESA or Roscosmos would be better to mention alongside NASA.",t3_e6q96g
faj9nlt,t3_e6q96g,Oh wow. Earth is an egg too,t3_e6q96g
fn88kzo,t3_e6q96g,"As soon as it was revealed to be a crack, I knew the ending. Cool!",t3_e6q96g
f9svv5f,t3_e6q96g,I swear i read a story exactly like this on this sub before but not as goofy.,t3_e6q96g
f9t52ow,t3_e6q96g,Amazing.,t3_e6q96g
f9tf5ig,t3_e6q96g,"This was a fun read.  I don’t watch Dr. Who either so it’s a new concept for me and one that was very enjoyable.  I do agree with other comments about some of the words used making it a little campy but still, overall, fun.  Now, the question, what is hatching?",t3_e6q96g
f9spu7o,t3_e6q96g,Unoriginal and not scary. Next time you try to write something like this you should refrain from using terms like ‘moonpoo’. Completely ruins the atmosphere.,t3_e6q96g
f9tg9ne,t3_e6q96g,I was hoping Eggman was gonna blow it up but it was just that plant dinosaur from Mario Galaxy,t3_e6q96g
f9sw0y1,t1_f9slyhp,"In starting to wish I did watch Dr.Who now, but unfortunately I dont. This has happened to me before, i guess there is just so much content out there that a lot of it has already been done. But I hope you liked it all the same.",t3_e6q96g
f9smzy7,t1_f9slyhp,Wasn't that a fantastic episode?,t3_e6q96g
f9t7pkg,t1_f9slyhp,My first thought was actually from the 11th’s Doctor’s first episode.  My brain immediately went “Prisoner Zero has escaped.”,t3_e6q96g
f9wc0hz,t1_f9slyhp,"And now you have me mentally reviewing what I know of Doctor Who, trying to work out which episode that was. I don't recall it, and I know most of the ones from 2005 up through season 8 or so pretty well. The closest I'm getting is in 6, where the asteroid is alive. Good episode, that one.",t3_e6q96g
fc6gn2e,t1_f9slyhp,Spoilers much?,t3_e6q96g
f9syq96,t1_f9sylm2,haha thanks for the analysis. I hope you enjoyed the story.,t3_e6q96g
f9ut8jn,t1_f9sylm2,"Pretty sure that if mama is big enough to lay an egg the size of the fricking moon, they use some other type of energy to move around lmao. I doubt planets gravitational pull has any effect on them",t3_e6q96g

f9sv8gf,t1_f9stost,The 500 word limit stopped me from getting to lovecraft with it.,t3_e6q96g

f9sx67s,t1_f9swyde,"Too be honest, I'm a little discouraged. I didnt know it was so similar to a Dr.Who plotline and I'm getting some negative feedback saying I'm plagiarizing. I think I may leave the story as is and work on other stories.",t3_e6q96g
f9u0cc2,t1_f9tyc88,I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_e6q96g
f9w5nwc,t1_f9te2ic,Thank you for the encouragement!,t3_e6q96g
f9u09d4,t1_f9tmgco,Haha I suppose I went to far in the opposite direction. Wanted to make the last line more shocking if I made the first little bit humorous. Guess it didnt work haha,t3_e6q96g
f9u0dlw,t1_f9tykh3,Thank you! I'm glad you liked it!,t3_e6q96g
f9sy1di,t1_f9sxf8x,"I'm glad you liked it, and the moonpoo thing was just me dialing the suspense back trying to make the last sentence hit harder. I was also trying to reference boaty mcboatface as well. But I dont think there will be a part 2, a lot of people are telling me this story is from an episode of Dr.Who, unfortunately I dont watxh Dr.Who so I had no idea, but the insinuation of plagiarism is very discouraging.",t3_e6q96g
f9svv28,t1_f9ssvwf,"I guess my description was a but limited due to the 500 word limit, but it was meant to be a long, black scar across the moon. Something that look like a crack or fissure. I'll try and make things clearer in the future. Thanks for the feedback.",t3_e6q96g

f9swfce,t1_f9svv5f,"Ah, probably  I am told it is similar to the plot from a Dr.Who episode. So i guess the idea has been done. Regardless, I hope you liked it. My intent was to go from goofy to a more cosmic horror in a second.",t3_e6q96g
f9uxr1y,t1_f9svv5f,Tbh I've heard this exact twist at least a few times. I knew how it was going to end when I read the title. Not to say it was a bad story but the concept has been done for ages.,t3_e6q96g
f9t5hqe,t1_f9t52ow,Thank you!,t3_e6q96g
f9u0n9u,t1_f9tf5ig,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed it!,t3_e6q96g
f9svkl4,t1_f9spu7o,I liked it. Makes it more realistic and relatable so when he drops the final sentence it has more effect,t3_e6q96g
f9svo9q,t1_f9spu7o,"I am sorry you didnt like it. I am told this is the plot of a Dr. Who episode. There is a lot of content out there these days so I cant be expected to watch it all. So, I guess I should start watching it then. I am sorry you didnt like the story, but thank you for your feedback, it all helps to make me a better writer. The moonpoo thing was just meant to be a reference to Boaty McBoatface, but i guess it didnt land very well.",t3_e6q96g
f9tnfiv,t1_f9spu7o,The jokes are designed to put the reader at ease. And being honest you know darn well thats a realistic outcome if something like that really were to happen. Idiots everywhere will immediately try to name it something goofy and the jokes wont end until it becomes a real problem,t3_e6q96g
f9u0koy,t1_f9tg9ne,It was actually just Raphael. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞,t3_e6q96g
f9sw9gg,t1_f9sw0y1,"Yes, I definitely still liked it. It’s true with how many stories there are on a daily basis, it’s very hard for anyone to come up with something completely original. I don’t even know if it’s possible at this point to not be similar in some way to something.",t3_e6q96g
f9t9i49,t1_f9sw0y1,"Don't worry, the moon being an egg thing was also on game of thrones but both were done completely differently and take nothing away from your story!",t3_e6q96g

You absolutely should. It's an incredible show.",t3_e6q96g
fbme6pm,t1_f9sw0y1,You should totally watch Dr. Who,t3_e6q96g
fjg3j1k,t1_f9sw0y1,I feel the same way when i get an idea for a dnd character and it turns out there is an anime character with a similar gimmick. Great story though,t3_e6q96g
f9tppfn,t1_f9smzy7,"No, it was just more clara pandering where she ignores literally the entire population of earths wishes and still comes out the victor because its her.",t3_e6q96g
f9sn72d,t1_f9smzy7,Yeah. Though I’m mostly happy that the being from the egg was able to live in the end and laid a new egg so nothing bad happened as a result.,t3_e6q96g
f9u0jcw,t1_f9smzy7,Decent episode but trash pro-life politics tbh,t3_e6q96g
f9wflac,t1_f9wc0hz,Season 8 Episode 7: Kill the Moon.,t3_e6q96g
f9sximt,t1_f9sv8gf,"Loving that twist tho, I thought it was gonna explode. I really hope you will finish it anw :>>>",t3_e6q96g
f9sxb2v,t1_f9sx67s,"Oh, I never watched Dr. Who either as well. I can't wait for your other stories!",t3_e6q96g
f9t9pq2,t1_f9sx67s,"As said in my other comment, the plot is so different don't worry about it. It's the details that matter. Look at how many books and movies have the ""alien spaceship lands on Earth and threatens human existence"" plot line. They're still different and some are really great! Don't be discouraged",t3_e6q96g
f9ti40e,t1_f9sx67s,"Don't be discouraged by that. Doctor Who has been out for over 50 years and has a wide variety of random and weird-ass stories. I'm sure you can skim this subreddit for an hour and find 4 stories that are also incredibly similar to a Who plot.

How many times have we seen something on here that was ""inspired by"" something on TV or a movie or some media? Get your writing out how you see fit. You get better by practicing.",t3_e6q96g

Don't let those negative people get you down! People are always going to find something to criticize but eff those people. I've seen the doctor who episode in question, but that didn't make your story any less great. I was actually thinking like the person above, that you should post on r/nosleep a longer version of this and it would be awesome. Of course, I understand if you never planned to make the story longer. But if you did want to prior to getting negative comments and you let those negative comments dictate your next move, then you should stop it and just go with what you wanted to do in the first place. I know I'd still read and enjoy it, as I'm sure many others would. Either way, great stuff and I hope to see more from you. You're a great writer. 

Signed, a fellow writer (who wishes she could write spooky stories like this but whose writing is far less interesting)",t3_e6q96g
f9vb1ug,t1_f9sx67s,"Don't get discouraged!! I LOVED it. I didn't know anything about the Dr. Who story line at all, and I think the idea of the moon as an egg is an incredibly unique thing, and you are right, there are ways to have parallel creative thoughts to others. If anything, this seemed more like a Junji Ito story more than anything else, which makes it awesome!",t3_e6q96g
f9w46o9,t1_f9sx67s,"I wouldn't worry about it too much. They have so many stories that someone's bound to write something similar at some point. I saw a story basically about weeping angels on this sub not long ago, and that episode is one of the show most famous ones (unlike the moon/egg). Don't let that hold you back, I thought your story was great!

Also, definitely watch Doctor Who. You won't regret it!",t3_e6q96g
f9t21yv,t1_f9stv0y,"Your absolute lack of respect makes me appreciate I'll never have to suffer your company.

As you say beast, perhaps...in another life.",t3_e6q96g
