f7cfs1u,t1_f7cevti,"Lol. No you r not. I am just a bad writer. Usually stories posted here have a big reveal in the end. 
This one suggests that somehow Bram stoker knew how to fight these aliens and he put clues regarding that in his work.
It is not supposed to be a scary story, I just didn't know where else to post something so short.
The bigger idea that I am getting to here is that throughout history a single person or a group of people have littered clues about an impending apocalypse and how to fight it, but due to the alien nature they are subconsciously preparing our response.

Edit: Of course this would mean that stoker is immortal or that is not his real identity",t3_due333
