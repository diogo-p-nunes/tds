This is really good and haunting. Honestly why wouldn’t a police officer assume something was up or she was pretending to not be calling them",t3_eb4a8j
fb2fz7r,t3_eb4a8j,911 dispatcher kind of deserves it though,t3_eb4a8j
fb2ca55,t3_eb4a8j,Oof.. heavy. Like it tho!,t3_eb4a8j
fb3gxdi,t3_eb4a8j,Just some constructive criticism..a 911 dispatcher would never immediately assume it’s a prank.,t3_eb4a8j
fbhi9w9,t3_eb4a8j,A bit confused? What happened to the dispatcher?,t3_eb4a8j
fb4z0ar,t1_fb3gxdi,"Haha

fb9yr7u,t1_fb3gxdi,A *good* 911 dispatcher would never assume it's a prank.,t3_eb4a8j
fb3x5i2,t1_fb3gxdi,Are you my English teacher? Constructive criticism on a Reddit post,t3_eb4a8j
fbzg0w3,t1_fbhi9w9,"The girl whose call he ignored, was murdered. To this day she continues to haunt the now former dispatcher. It serves him right.",t3_eb4a8j
fb45yn9,t1_fb3x5i2,"Many fledgling authors who are trying to hone their writing/storytelling skills post to this sub. Honestly, unless it’s an obvious troll post that slipped past the mods somehow, *all* criticism should be constructive here. 

The problem is that it isn’t. And since it’s difficult to convey tone in a written post, it sometimes has to be said, either by prefacing the criticism/tip with something along the lines of “Great story, but...” or simply announcing that they’re trying to be helpful as this commenter has. Most authors find it helpful.

That said, I agree with the commenter that *most* 911 operators would not automatically think a call is a prank call, however, there are exceptions, and this could fall under that category. In every job, there are people who are shitty at it but either fall under the radar or know someone/something and stay on, coasting through, being shitty. I just saw a video about a 911 operator who treated a very scared woman like shit when she called to say she was trapped in her car in a flash flood. She berated the woman through the entire call and told her that she was stupid to try to drive through the water and kept saying she was being overdramatic when she cried or screamed. The trapped woman fucking died. 

I saw another story a few months ago about a 911 operator took a call similar to this, but the woman was pretending to order pizza (she had apparently seen that someone else had done this successfully; this was not the original “pizza call”) the operator *almost* hung up on her, but he asked the correct questions and she ended up being saved. 

It seems that this story addresses the “what if he hadn’t caught on?” side of the story.",t3_eb4a8j
