f7izbip,t1_f7ikobq,Wow! I am sorry to hear that... I hope your condition doesn't interfere much in your daily and professional life. As long as you don't eat humans though haha. Thanks!,t3_dwbnu7
f7nfrbp,t1_f7ikobq,"No, although that would be terrible too.  Allergic/intolerant to shellfish, gluten, all grains especially corn products, apples, pears, grapes, and eggs.  I'm so allergic to shellfish I can't be around it being cooked or eaten,or touch it.  I'm developing new issues too. It was my passion,so its hard to talk about.  I changed careers,but almost died from a staph infection in both my hands from allergy to plaster I was working with there. Looking for something I can do,and not become allergic to ,lol.",t3_dwbnu7
