fa7adv5,t3_e7xqha,This is seriously one of my top biggest fears. Certainly scarier than straightforward death.,t3_e7xqha
fa9ti93,t3_e7xqha,It's called anesthesia awareness and it's very real. Happened to me when I got my wisdom teeth removed.,t3_e7xqha
faa8i8c,t3_e7xqha,I had my wisdom teeth taken out at a very small clinic which didn't administer anesthetics for the operation.  I was given valium and novocain but I was completely awake for the entire procedure.  It was seriously hell on earth because I could feel the pressure of the scalpel cut the skin open inside my mouth.  The worst part was the sound.  Even though I couldn't technically feel pain my imagination was able to create it from the bone snapping sounds so close to my ears,t3_e7xqha
faar4vy,t3_e7xqha,"I had to get my teeth out at the hospital because i have cerebral palsy and i needed extra nurses to hall me out. Hearing all these stories, i am thankful that the anesthesia at the hospital works on me and i hate being put under",t3_e7xqha
fa7izs9,t1_fa7adv5,For reeeals.,t3_e7xqha
fa8j2uk,t1_fa7adv5,"If it helps, the doctors would see ur heart rate spiking and realise sthg was wrong",t3_e7xqha
fagyflc,t1_faa8i8c,"Bro I got this shot when they pulled mine i felt nothing at all pain wise just a LOT of pressure, and I heard it snap off my jawbone or something the grinding was in your ears all around it. What a crazy experience.",t3_e7xqha
faa58f5,t1_fa8j2uk,Nope not necessarily.  Anesthesiologist can be watching and there is no sign of awareness. Pretty scary but extremely rare.,t3_e7xqha
fa8k8a5,t1_fa8j2uk,What if it didnt spike tho ðŸ˜¨,t3_e7xqha
