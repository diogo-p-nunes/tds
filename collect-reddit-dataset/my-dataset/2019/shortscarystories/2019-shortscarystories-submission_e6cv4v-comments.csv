fa33imp,t3_e6cv4v,"Back in the morning of June 24, 2016 I was visiting the LHC as part of an university tour and I saw the shadows of the people working there drifting apart from their owners. The male scientists and security staff had theirs more separated than the female ones, and the admin's, office workers and tourists had theirs only slightly separate, it was weird and at the time I though it was the lighting playing tricks. But now I know what it was. No more than an hour or two after the last tour group left. They made that experiment. The one that opened the portal through which came those ""things"" our governments called ""feminists"". Only a handful of office workers and admin's managed to make it to the surface before the air force tried (and failed) to collapse the place and bury the portal and those demonic creatures.",t3_e6cv4v
