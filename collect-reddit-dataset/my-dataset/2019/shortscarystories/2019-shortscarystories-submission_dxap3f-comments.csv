f7oyvx4,t3_dxap3f,Short and sweet—really leaves a lot to the imagination. Makes you think twice before heading out at night lol,t3_dxap3f
f7pn9x4,t3_dxap3f,"I've seen a lot of people overdo this sort of thing. This piece definitely knows how to get in and out to maximum effect, though. Good job.",t3_dxap3f
f7ox5zq,t3_dxap3f,[deleted],t3_dxap3f
f7owy7a,t3_dxap3f,Creepy. Nice.,t3_dxap3f
f7p223p,t3_dxap3f,Brilliantly unsettling. The roadkill walking away gave me the creeps,t3_dxap3f
f7ph76g,t3_dxap3f,Welcome to Night Vale,t3_dxap3f
f7pl91h,t3_dxap3f,I work 9pm-5am and sometimes when I’m driving home I actually have to do a double take because I think I see things that aren’t there. Reading this creeped me out lol.,t3_dxap3f
f7q6ice,t3_dxap3f,"This just gave me chills! I love this type of horror - exactly what I'm looking for, unsettling enough to let your mind wander in the worst way. I find a lot of people give away and overexplain too much, but this struck the balance just right.",t3_dxap3f
f7qwymu,t3_dxap3f,"Keep something, anything - a coat, a water bottle, some trash, on your passenger seat. That way, it's occupied, in case some thing wants a ride. Keep your eyes on the road, and only look at the shoulders when absolutely necessary.",t3_dxap3f
f7p7iej,t3_dxap3f,"this was different, i'd like to hear more about it",t3_dxap3f
f7qgd1s,t3_dxap3f,Particularly liked the imagery of the construction worker. Great piece.,t3_dxap3f
f7qfm8m,t3_dxap3f,I work 4pm to 3am tonight. Thank you for this. I’ll be scared shitless all the way home after my shift.,t3_dxap3f
f7p59gb,t3_dxap3f,Nice,t3_dxap3f
f7qthmr,t3_dxap3f,Love driving at night because oftentimes the things you see on familiar roads are totally new and unfamiliar.,t3_dxap3f
f7r53kw,t3_dxap3f,"You know, I already have these fears of the dark, and driving...and driving in the dark. In just a few short paragraphs, you've exaserbated my irrational fear to terror. Kudos.",t3_dxap3f
f7tl3pv,t3_dxap3f,I work 7p-7a.  I have done half shifts where I'm driving home at 1am. It's amazing how your mind works that late at night.  You almost scare yourself.,t3_dxap3f
f7r7ho8,t3_dxap3f,Hm sounds just like growing up in rural Pennsylvania,t3_dxap3f
f7qmicc,t3_dxap3f,Nice work,t3_dxap3f
f7qsaqr,t3_dxap3f,"ew, nice so spooky",t3_dxap3f
f7r1jiw,t3_dxap3f,thats creepy i want more,t3_dxap3f
f7rvcqx,t3_dxap3f,"This is creepy, good job I'm very unsettled.",t3_dxap3f
f7sd49d,t3_dxap3f,This is one hella good story,t3_dxap3f
f7u7bog,t3_dxap3f,"Very well done! This is probably my favorite story in recent memory!

Good job!",t3_dxap3f
f7x0u6e,t3_dxap3f,I live in country Australia and do a lot of shift work. Occasionally at night I pull over to stretch the legs and maybe have a pee on a road with no traffic. Sometimes (not all the time) you feel like someone is looking at you - it's those moments which are fucking unsettling & I can't get in the car quick enough.  This story taps into that fear. Well done OP.,t3_dxap3f
f8e6wwy,t3_dxap3f,"This reminds me of a  creepy road in Chatsworth, Ga. On both sides its surrounded by trees with next to no street lights. Especially scary during Fall season. For me it was unnerving my first and only time driving down it at night.",t3_dxap3f
f9bvfo5,t3_dxap3f,"I realize this was uploaded 2 weeks ago, but I just had to comment. It's been a while since I've been legitimately creeped out by a story on this sub. It's just the right balance of vague and descriptive. Well done!",t3_dxap3f
fb5llya,t3_dxap3f,The car behind you must not be a BMW because those guys never use their blinkers,t3_dxap3f
f8a9mcc,t3_dxap3f,"This reminds me of that sub with creepy instructionals. Anyone know what I’m talking about?

Edit: /r/HGK477",t3_dxap3f
f8byw23,t3_dxap3f,"This really sparks my imagination, especially with the roadkill that moves",t3_dxap3f
f7ozlwy,t1_f7oyvx4,"There’s a formula to writing horror that I’ve noticed - come up with an unsettling concept, imply that it is a legit danger, and then describe symptoms, not the cause.",t3_dxap3f
f7oxhd3,t1_f7ox5zq,"I do 3 shift work and the days are really short this time of the year. Today I was working from 8 am to 4 pm, it was pitch black when I drove to work and almost dark when I got out.

I do a lot of driving in the dark at this time of the year.",t3_dxap3f
f7qolyg,t1_f7ph76g,"One of Welcome to Night Vale's side projects, Alice Isn't Dead, did an episode that this story reminded me of. Just describing a bunch of creepy things that the protagonist saw as she drove, but the message was that she didn't need to stop and be involved with them. They weren't being creepy for her sake.",t3_dxap3f
f7qx4q0,t1_f7qthmr,"You're not supposed to look at them. Seeing them implies noticing them, and notice is reciprocal. Ignore them, and they'll ignore you.",t3_dxap3f
f7u7pee,t1_f7u7bog,"Horror shorts are like poetry - you can’t force them, they’ll emerge when inspiration comes.

...except inspiration is in the shape of ”hey wouldn’t it be fucked up if...”",t3_dxap3f
f9by1wv,t1_f9bvfo5,"Thank you!

It was a fun exercise, I rarely ever write short stories anymore.",t3_dxap3f
f7pgehm,t1_f7ozlwy,"Hell yeah, things get far less unsettling if we know what causes it. The vagueness really forces your mind to fill in the blanks.

Great story btw, really liked it :)",t3_dxap3f
f7rlooz,t1_f7ozlwy,"Ah, I like that. Very true and applicable.",t3_dxap3f
f7u5k34,t1_f7ozlwy,"I love it! Are you self-taught? I want to improve, maybe I'll try out this method!",t3_dxap3f
f7r43rt,t1_f7ozlwy,I'm tired so what's a cause?,t3_dxap3f
f7p60g8,t1_f7oxhd3,My husband works 3 shift 10pm to 6;30am,t3_dxap3f
f7qvmdc,t1_f7oxhd3,This totally creeped me out and I also do 8pm-4am a lot! You start to question your own sanity bc you’re only up in the darkness lol,t3_dxap3f
f7u5xkd,t1_f7qolyg,"I never managed to get into Nightvale. Is it possible to jump in later in the series, when their material is hopefully more refined?",t3_dxap3f
f7rb4kf,t1_f7qolyg," Thanks for the reminder, I haven't listened to Alice yet!",t3_dxap3f
f849mgl,t1_f7pgehm,"And it makes you wonder if all of these weird things are connected, or if they have different causes.",t3_dxap3f
f7ujb6q,t1_f7u5k34,...self-taught?,t3_dxap3f
f7u5pma,t1_f7r43rt,"He means don't describe the scary ghost, describe the chill in the air and the feeling of being watched by someone who resents your presence.",t3_dxap3f
f7ww4km,t1_f7u5xkd,"Personal opinion, I think the first five or so episodes are pretty representative of the series as a whole, so if you didn’t like them I don’t recommend the rest. If you’re still interested, though, the official website has a [starter’s guide](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/listen) that lists some of the best episodes that can be listened to without context.

I do recommend their side projects Alice Isn’t Dead and Within the Wires, though. They’re heavy on the science fiction and government conspiracy themes, too, but the plots are much more condensed and streamlined so it’s less of a “commitment” to follow.",t3_dxap3f
f84hdog,t1_f7u5xkd,"I recommend the episode ""a story about you"", just off the top of my head. Not like an actual starting point, just this episode, i remember having a good feeling while listening to it",t3_dxap3f
f81anef,t1_f7ujb6q,"Like, have you taken any horror-writing classes?",t3_dxap3f
f7vqsb2,t1_f7u5pma,What would the cause of this be?,t3_dxap3f
f81apem,t1_f7ww4km,Thanks!,t3_dxap3f
f8sndph,t1_f84hdog,Is it standalone?,t3_dxap3f
f81c5cq,t1_f81anef,I’ve never lived in a town where any establishment offered classes in writing.,t3_dxap3f
f8sx0sv,t1_f8sndph,"Yeah, pretty much",t3_dxap3f
f94z4pk,t1_f8sx0sv,Thanks for the tip!,t3_dxap3f
