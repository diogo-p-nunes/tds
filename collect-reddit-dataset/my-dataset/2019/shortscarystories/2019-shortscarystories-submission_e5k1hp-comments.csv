f9khwpp,t1_f9kgzw0,"The ""mind"" is being shared between two bodies. When the machines that are connected to the bodies induce sleep, the ""mind"" wakes up in the other body. One body experiences constant torture and pain, the other is the torturer. In essence, both bodies cause torture to the ""mind"" inhabiting them. The ""mind"" is forced to be both the torturer and the tortured.",t3_e5k1hp
