fax43rp,t1_fax2cis,"Hello, I was trying to imply that Brian is a ghost stuck on a ghost ship. In death he unknowingly continues the exact same routine as the last day of his life. 

Thank you for reading!",t3_eas8hj
fax4da5,t1_fax43rp,"oh, thanks. I still have a question though. why does brian think that the captain is still there?",t3_eas8hj
fba4wpi,t1_fax4da5,"He doesn't know he's dead so he thinks the captain is available to report to. I may be wrong, but that seems the logical answer I'm understanding.",t3_eas8hj
