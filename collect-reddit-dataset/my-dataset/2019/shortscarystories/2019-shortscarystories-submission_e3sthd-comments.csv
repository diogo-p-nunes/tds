f952sm0,t3_e3sthd,Oh my.... oh my fucking god op. You sick (amazingly talented) fuck. Thanks for the horrifying read!,t3_e3sthd
f94zhuj,t3_e3sthd,"I had to reread it a couple times to understand the twist, but goddamn if it wasn't a good one. Love this!",t3_e3sthd
f9516g3,t3_e3sthd,I really donâ€™t understand this someone help me out haha,t3_e3sthd
f99aup3,t3_e3sthd,"This is so twisted, I feel like I commited a crime just by reading it!",t3_e3sthd
f9aaeju,t3_e3sthd,sweet hooome alabaaama,t3_e3sthd
f9ayo86,t1_f9ay03o,"Thank you for your feedback. My story didn't contain either. But if that's how you interpreted it, I'm sorry. There was consenting sex between adults (Ted and Francesca) but absolutely no rape and/or paedophilia. The fact that you assumed Francesca was a child is questionable on your part, not mine.",t3_e3sthd
f9548b6,t1_f952sm0,You're a sick fuck for enjoying it so much! Hahahaha jkjk thank you so much! I'm so glad you enjoyed it ðŸ˜Š,t3_e3sthd
f94zmwx,t1_f94zhuj,Thank you so much! I had a lot of fun with this one.,t3_e3sthd
f9565yj,t1_f9516g3,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Sure thing! So basically, Tom is obsessed with Francesca, this absolutely gorgeous redhead. He stalks her on dates and spies on her at home during her most intimate moments. The only problem is, she's his daughter. Anyway, Tom doesn't like the guy (the ungrateful man) Francesca is seeing so he decides to kill him. He sneaks in, puts her in a deep sleep so she won't wake up while he performs the deed (let your imagination run wild here). When Francesca finally wakes up the next afternoon, she is surprised to see Tom, her dad, cooking Mickey Mouse pancakes in the kitchen. Tom almost gets caught though but removes the blood on his sleeve before he's discovered. No one will ever be good enough for his little girl. Hopefully that helps a little!",t3_e3sthd
f99fcpq,t1_f99aup3,Hahaha yes! Thank you!,t3_e3sthd
f9b09tc,t1_f9ayo86,"Well, there's this:

> Standing over her, he fantasized about all the things he'd do to her. He gently inserted the needle in her neck and emptied the contents of the syringe.

And once linked with this in the comment section:

> He sneaks in, puts her in a deep sleep so she won't wake up while he performs the deed (let your imagination run wild here).

There is an *implication* of rape as you said it yourself in the comment I linked. We don't allow stories with rape here either explicitly or implied.",t3_e3sthd
f95fuhh,t1_f9548b6,"I went to your account to see if you had any other horror stories (I strongly encourage you to write some more btw, like I said, you have a real talent.) and happened to stumble upon your r/showerthoughts post ""we're all sick fucks that decide to supress it."" And thought it was kinda funny, considering it was posted only an hour before this interaction. You forshadowed my accusation, good sir. Always one step ahead of the game.",t3_e3sthd
f9b0ws6,t1_f9b09tc,"The ""deed"" was him killing Ted. I respect the rules of this subreddit 100%. But in the end, I guess we all play by your rules.",t3_e3sthd
f95g8py,t1_f95fuhh,"Wow, you're right! That's so funny! Thank you again for your amazing feedback and encouraging words. I will strive to please you once more!",t3_e3sthd
