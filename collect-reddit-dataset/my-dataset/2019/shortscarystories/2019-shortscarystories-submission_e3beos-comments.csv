f9pdufs,t1_f9pdrek,That old movie the princess bride. At the end the hero threatens to take the eyes and nose and fingers of the villain and leave him his ears so he can hear people screaming in horror as they see him!! One of my all time fave movies,t3_e3beos

f95bo3n,t1_f94m8d0,Actually if you think about it... it’s only terrifying for the abuser or someone who is an abuser.,t3_e3beos
f98qkti,t1_f95bo3n,"Very true. I don’t know if there’s a subreddit about short stories that are scary for the character(s), so it’s okay in my book!",t3_e3beos
