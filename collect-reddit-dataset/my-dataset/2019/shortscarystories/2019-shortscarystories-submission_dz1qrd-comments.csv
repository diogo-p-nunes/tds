f84sxht,t3_dz1qrd,So how are yah going to take her for dinner bro,t3_dz1qrd
f84r2jg,t3_dz1qrd,"Yeah, sorry bro, this made very little sense.   


Remember you have a 500 word limit- take advantage of it.",t3_dz1qrd
f84wfsp,t3_dz1qrd,"You had a good, peep naked sis and spot she is some monstrosity, has some creepy thing on her or something, set up..",t3_dz1qrd
f84szpa,t1_f84sxht,Can’t.,t3_dz1qrd
f84r3i8,t1_f84r2jg,Little sister is a room.,t3_dz1qrd
f84wgyq,t1_f84wfsp,What?,t3_dz1qrd
f84r90f,t1_f84r3i8,"....but why? How? Dude, this is...illogical at best. 

Again, you have up to 500 words. A story like that has potential to be super unsettling, but you made it _too_ short and it's honestly nonsensical.",t3_dz1qrd
f84zo5t,t1_f84wgyq,"The story almost until the end was in the path of it being the narative:

Spot naked sister as you enter the door, and see something weird ON or about her.. like, in a cohesive way, in a way that is something that is understandable...

Like maybe you see some weird eyes on her back staring back at you while you what her.

Maybe another creature is hanging in the ceiling and watching her too.

Something like this... I said you hsd a good set up",t3_dz1qrd
f84rak0,t1_f84r90f,That’s the point with my stories. Nonsensical surreal horror.,t3_dz1qrd
f84ztn9,t1_f84zo5t,"Oh. Thanks. But I think you misunderstood. 

The little sister is the room, her skin is the floor and walls and covering on the furniture. He just walked in when she had her skin receded.",t3_dz1qrd
f84riuv,t1_f84rak0,"...'doesn't make sense' doesn't equal 'good'. You want your readers to be able to figure out what's going on, at least to a degree. Surreal is all well and good, but this isn't so much as it is random. It's honestly not frightening in the least, mostly due to how little sense it makes.

Cool idea, awesome concept, but your execution needs some work. I get you want to be 'surreal' but I think you need to work on making it strange and surreal but still _understandable_, as many surreal works are.",t3_dz1qrd
f84s3yu,t1_f84riuv,"Reality is sometimes not understandable. It just is, and there’s nothing one can do to change it.",t3_dz1qrd
f85620t,t1_f84s3yu,"Yeah ok 'I am fourteen and this is deep',  nice pesudo-philosophy there- but it doesn't change that people want to be able to enjoy a story, at least to an interpritable degree, to enjoy it.",t3_dz1qrd
f856dg6,t1_f85620t,"Ok. I wasn’t trying to be deep, though I can understand why you feel that I did. I’m just going to continue to do what I do, but with better hindsight. Thank you for your criticism.",t3_dz1qrd
f8575pa,t1_f856dg6,"Hindsight is how we learn. I do wish you luck- you have potential, and your ideas are solid and unique, so keep improving.",t3_dz1qrd
f857aqh,t1_f8575pa,Thank you. I will.,t3_dz1qrd
