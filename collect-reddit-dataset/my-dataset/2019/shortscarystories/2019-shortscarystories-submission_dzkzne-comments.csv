f89diqi,t3_dzkzne,"I usually see the twist coming in these short stories, 500 word limit doesn't allow for very subtle foreshadowing... this, however, took me completely off guard",t3_dzkzne
f89ibvm,t3_dzkzne,"Only thing I didnt quite understand is when it was stated her daughter was stabbed to death, and someone committing suicide usually doesnt stab themselves repeatedly",t3_dzkzne
f89fc53,t3_dzkzne,i didn‚Äôt know it was possible to create this much emotion in a 500 word story. also gives off some r/entitledparents vibe,t3_dzkzne
f88ydlj,t3_dzkzne,"This is pretty, and well written. And it sucks that something this well written didn't have any comments. I know how disheartening that is. But realize it's amazing.",t3_dzkzne
f8958j7,t3_dzkzne,"Very well done, absolutely beautifully written and a gutpunch of a twist.",t3_dzkzne
f890pjz,t3_dzkzne,That is amazing. Actually gave me chills.,t3_dzkzne
f89fduh,t3_dzkzne,Very nice job. Your story definitely held my attention.,t3_dzkzne
f89gyqk,t3_dzkzne,I love the way you told the story! Very captivating!,t3_dzkzne
f89h70m,t3_dzkzne,Good story and a little true sometimes parents can‚Äôt handle the truth.,t3_dzkzne
f89k5ip,t3_dzkzne,Bro too true to how parents react to suicide a lot of the time.,t3_dzkzne
f89jyqy,t3_dzkzne,"Excellent work, better than about 90% of the submissions I see on here.

One small point of criticism: repeating the first line of the story at the end is a good device for holding the reader's attention onto the point of the story, but doing so verbatim comes off as a little cheesy. If I were you I'd alter it slightly while keeping the same message. 

I look forward to any of your future submissions.",t3_dzkzne
f89gs5o,t3_dzkzne,Amazing üëç‚ù§,t3_dzkzne
f89y173,t3_dzkzne,"What a great story, and what talent you have!  The twist at the end was the last thing I expected, and took my breath away (I was expecting the mother). I'm new to Reddit, but I'll certainly watch for your stories. Thank you.",t3_dzkzne
f89iidt,t3_dzkzne,"This is amazing. You write beautifully, almost lyrically. The plot is ingenious. I hope you share more stories!",t3_dzkzne
f95nc51,t3_dzkzne,"Before I finish reading this I'm gonna guess she murdered her daughter


Edit: I was wrong",t3_dzkzne
f89w19r,t3_dzkzne,"Amazing plot; way too much explanations tho

You could end it at the part when the daughter talks about the note and that'd be still great!
Or the mom explaining could be just one sentence.",t3_dzkzne
f9jocyc,t3_dzkzne,This was fucking great.,t3_dzkzne
f89jrqu,t3_dzkzne,Haunting and so beautifully written...would love to read more from you...,t3_dzkzne
f89kuap,t3_dzkzne,Right in the feels op.  Great storytelling,t3_dzkzne
f89lztk,t3_dzkzne,"I almost cried, this was so good",t3_dzkzne
f89obkr,t3_dzkzne,This was excellent. Great job and keep it up,t3_dzkzne
f89pjyy,t3_dzkzne,*a sole tear tickles down my face*,t3_dzkzne
f89shfw,t3_dzkzne,You could say something like 'the knife slashes that took her baby's life constantly on her anguished mind' instead of stabbing if you don't feel 'stabbing' quite works.,t3_dzkzne
f89tf5l,t3_dzkzne,Reminds me of the relationship my mother has with my sister‚Äôs death. Great story.,t3_dzkzne
f89xoms,t3_dzkzne,"This hits hard, and it's written so well.",t3_dzkzne
f89zeim,t3_dzkzne,Love it. One of the best if not best short scary stories I have ever read and I read them almost daily on here and other sites. This would be an amazing book or longer story. All about the ghost mom and maybe some one trying to figure out what's going on that's still alive. Then the surprising ending. Great job!,t3_dzkzne
f8a1da7,t3_dzkzne,Beautiful.,t3_dzkzne
f8a3xpb,t3_dzkzne,Good story!,t3_dzkzne
f8a6ixx,t3_dzkzne,"hello! i really loved this story and was just wondering if i could use/read it in a video. i make asmr videos and sometimes i like to read scary stories from Reddit. i will of course give credit however you like, but if you don‚Äôt want me using it that is okay! thanks üíú‚ú®",t3_dzkzne
f8a96q4,t3_dzkzne,Oof felt that one,t3_dzkzne
f8ajzm3,t3_dzkzne,"This is a good one I must say, and pretty sad too.",t3_dzkzne
f8am6qq,t3_dzkzne,The art of a cliffhanger and reveal in one sentence. Amazing!! Loved and felt this.,t3_dzkzne
f8amojr,t3_dzkzne,"Good story, but one part I can't quite wrap my head around, is how did the boyfriend get thrown out the window over and over?",t3_dzkzne
f8asage,t3_dzkzne,This was really good! Great idea and very well executed. Good job!,t3_dzkzne
f8atxcn,t3_dzkzne,"This was really great. I didn't see the twist coming at all. 
Very well written, would read again.",t3_dzkzne
f8b581e,t3_dzkzne,Damn this one is good!,t3_dzkzne
f8b5lkq,t3_dzkzne,"Wow, fantastic story. Didn't see that coming at all. Great writing.",t3_dzkzne
f8be2bw,t3_dzkzne,"Ooh, that gave me inside my chest tingle-itches.  I like!",t3_dzkzne
f8be8sj,t3_dzkzne,Love this story. Best I've read in a while. Great job!,t3_dzkzne
f8gdenr,t3_dzkzne,"I do not get the twist everyone is talking about.
So mums ghost killed the priest and the story starts again?
Is that the twist? It doesn‚Äôt seem shocking",t3_dzkzne
f8t0unt,t3_dzkzne,Wow that was dark,t3_dzkzne
f8vm60m,t3_dzkzne,"Great story. I guess daughter had a illicit relationship with priest. When mother had found out the secret, daughter killed herself right?",t3_dzkzne
f8ajam3,t1_f89diqi,"Same! When it said ""but you do know"" I thought the mom went crazy and killed the daughter and refused to accept it in death. I was very pleasantly surprised, well done OP!!!",t3_dzkzne
f8anmvr,t1_f89diqi,"Can you explain what's the twist, please?

From why I've read, it seems like the daughter is actually a ghost and her death was the cause of her mother's madness.",t3_dzkzne
f89ilq1,t1_f89ibvm,"Yeah, fair- i didn't want ""had her wrists cut"" or ""was hanged"" or something else that would make the cause of death obvious, but looking back I think i went too far in the other direction.

I guess she stabbed herself in the throat and bled out?  


Edit- yeah, I changed it. Looking back it's just to weird a mental image.",t3_dzkzne
f89jn2l,t1_f89ibvm,"You actually can easily stab yourself to death if you want to, the injuries won't incapacitate you immediately.",t3_dzkzne
fafzu7i,t1_f89fc53,"Oooh, have they finally renamed r/raisedbynarcissists? Excellent!",t3_dzkzne
f8acgu1,t1_f8a6ixx,Go ahead! I'm happy you like my story and I always appreciate validation,t3_dzkzne
fm4ufpk,t1_f8gdenr,"i believe the twist is that the daughter is telling the story, and also that the daughter wasn‚Äôt murdered",t3_dzkzne
f8aot30,t1_f8anmvr,"you're exactly right, daughter killed herself and mother couldn't understand why she would do so because mother thinks she was an ideal mother, that she couldn't have done anything wrong. its impossible that her sweet child would do something like this to herself",t3_dzkzne
f8ayu54,t1_f8anmvr,"it says in the second paragraph ""she died of a broken heart after the death of her daughter."" I think the daughter can interact with her mum from the afterlife, but not with living people. the mother's ghost, on the other hand, is on a rampage against anyone who could possibly br her daughter's killer. the twist comes when we find out that the narrator is the vengeful ghost's daughter, who died by her own hand",t3_dzkzne
f89iyqe,t1_f89ilq1,"Your reasoning for writing it like that makes sense, but maybe it would've went better if she was shot to death instead of stabbed? Idk, I'm not much of a writer or a critic, just offering my own opinion on it. Still a great story nonetheless.",t3_dzkzne
f8a48r5,t1_f89ilq1,I thought the same thing. Perhaps just say her daughter was killed. Nothing wrong with keeping it vague. The stabbed to death makes the ending hard to grasp,t3_dzkzne
f8a3bxj,t1_f89ilq1,"I like the misdirect, although it took me out of the story a bit while I was pondering the stabbing. Still a nice and creative story that hasn‚Äôt been overdone though.",t3_dzkzne
f8ajkzd,t1_f89ilq1,"You could also use ""took her young daughter's life"" or ""ended the life of her daughters before she could barely begin to come in to womanhood fairly"", ""drained her daughter's lifeblood"" or something along those lines.",t3_dzkzne
fai549n,t1_fafzu7i,i actually meant r/insaneparents but ig lol,t3_dzkzne
f8auvlm,t1_f8aot30,"And because of the narcissistic attitude of the mother, even as a ghost, she probably *did* heavily contribute to her daughters suicide.",t3_dzkzne
