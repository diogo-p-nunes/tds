f7e5557,t3_dvq6g3,"I don't understand the ending, why did NASA fake an asteroid? Otherwise it is well written",t3_dvq6g3
f7e5n9j,t3_dvq6g3,Ending explanation? Otherwise good story 👌,t3_dvq6g3
f7ecg4d,t3_dvq6g3,I like to think the ending is revealing that the person writing is actually an alien and people from earth just found the planet he lives on,t3_dvq6g3
f7ele9i,t3_dvq6g3,"I like the story a lot but history shows that most corporations value profits and short term gain over everything else. I don’t see these same entities becoming altruistic and civic-minded in the face of end times so this story truly must be set in an alien world.

Faced with the prospect of a cataclysm, Earth corporations would probably go balls out and do away with any safety measures or environmental protections.

Many are already trying for this and there isn’t even a cataclysm (e.g., cost analysis on how many people can acceptably die versus profit margins, fracking causes seismic activity and poisons water tables, the Keystone pipeline is leaking exactly as protestors predicted, the BP oil spill, Purdu Pharma execs found guilty of criminal charges, Wells Fargo fraud, etc etc etc etc etc)

Citizens United (in the U.S.) says that corporations are people and can pump money into backing political candidates (have a political voice like a person) but corporations cannot be held criminally liable like people can and the fines they face are laughable and are folded into their estimated costs of doing business. They routinely socialize loss and privatize gain. Oil and gasoline profits go straight into their coffers. The ongoing cost of cleaning up an oil spill and the resulting loss of livelihoods come out of tax payer pockets.",t3_dvq6g3
f7eeb92,t3_dvq6g3,I thought it’s a future civilisation built upon ours. Then millennia’s after us one of our original nasa satellites falls from the new humanities orbit. Like our progress unintentionally saved us from making the same mistakes that destroyed us,t3_dvq6g3
f7e4npg,t3_dvq6g3,You mean 3 numbered as in 3 digits right ?,t3_dvq6g3
f7edos0,t3_dvq6g3,"Great work! My initial interpretation was that it was an alien planet, but it could very well have been the other explanation. Maybe creating an apocalypse would work haha",t3_dvq6g3
f7eooqi,t3_dvq6g3,"i really enjoyed this, it was awesomeee",t3_dvq6g3
f7fb8qc,t3_dvq6g3,If it was purposely a fasle flag made by NASA thats a mega big brain move,t3_dvq6g3
f7gxpnz,t3_dvq6g3,"This reminds me of an old sci-fi story I just spent like a half hr trying to find with no luck. My vague memory is it starts with this young boy going to a fancy jewelry story and saying he wants to buy his mom a diamond necklace and what can he get for 83 cents (or whatever tiny amount he had). The dude at the counter is like, you're in luck that's just enough for this! and gives him a zillion dollar diamond necklace. It turns out he's the rich store owner, and lots of rich powerful elites just found out a toxic space cloud is gonna wipe out humanity in like a day (of course no one bothers telling the plebs), so many of them go out and randomly give say their wealth for the good feels. The president resigns so his idiot vp can be president for a day. Turns out the poison cloud burns up in our polluted atmosphere and nothing bad happens. The rich people all try to get their stuff back and everyone's like helllll fucking no",t3_dvq6g3
f7eklsa,t3_dvq6g3,"It's kind of jarring how it goes straight from humanity being the best it can be to most of us being dead and the cities being overrun with vegetation. Did most people commit suicide or something rather than facing the meteor? It'd make sense, but I'm unclear. Good story though! I figure it's NASA lying to scare humanity into being better.",t3_dvq6g3
f7g4eop,t3_dvq6g3,"I think this strongly leans towards the ""alien planet"" possibility. If we put all our resources into it, 85 years is probably enough time to develop a self-sustaining mars colony, fill servers with as much human knowledge and culture as possible, and send frozen sperm and ovum donations to help maintain genetic diversity in the future population. So humans would just have done that.",t3_dvq6g3

f7ffman,t3_dvq6g3,"Loved this and the way you kept the ""ending"" as open for interpretation. Great job and keep it up",t3_dvq6g3
f7g3saz,t3_dvq6g3,"Love this! Very Twilight Zone inspired, would make a good movie. Maybe Nicholas Cage as the father?",t3_dvq6g3
f7jmofb,t3_dvq6g3,"I really like this, very well written. I like endings open to interpretation by the reader",t3_dvq6g3
f7qkyg3,t3_dvq6g3,"This was beautiful, I often daydream about similar scenarios. It's so nice that, at least in this story, the human race had the opportunity to redeem itself.",t3_dvq6g3
f7elvgq,t3_dvq6g3,"Enjoy your utopia while it lasts, I guess. Poor dopes.",t3_dvq6g3
f7g8s6g,t3_dvq6g3,"You prose is really good, but I can't suspend my disbelief for this story for a couple reasons (keeping in mind this is just my opinion):

1) If this is an engineered disaster, then you're telling me NASA somehow has Illuminati levels of influence and controls the entire planet's access to telescopes and monitoring equipment and can alter all results of independent research. 

2) The idea that people everyone would willingly sterilize themselves is both unlikely on an individual level and impossible to achieve on a global scale.

3) I understand that impending disaster can bring people together, but not that many, and not that quickly. For example, I lived in Korea for a year and they would definitely not lay down their hatred of the Japanese in a single century. 

4) If this is an alien planet, how are they speaking English?

5) Related to 4, if we take the English they're speaking as a translation convention for the sake of the audience, how can an alien read the phoenician alphabet well-enough to know four of its letters?

6) If alien, how did they have good enough technology to cure all of these diseases and maximize their potential in one generation, but somehow have such bad analysis tech that they thought a tiny satellite would be a world-ending asteroid.

And lastly: 

7) How was the satellite not *instantly vaporized* the moment it entered the atmosphere? 

I'd address some of these or at least give them some thought if you plan on doing another draft of this story. It's a pretty well executed narrative, but I personally feel like it needs another pass to really shine. Keep writing!",t3_dvq6g3
f7e60s1,t1_f7e5557,This isn't Earth but an alien planet NASA is looking to explore?,t3_dvq6g3
f7eh77p,t1_f7e5557,"I believe it's an alien planet. Homeboy said he blew out the 3 numbered candles on his cake. A lot of humans live till their 100s, but it isnt too common anymore. I'm thinking this is a different species with a longer lifespan. And the way he spells out NASA at the end kinda signifies that he's unfamiliar with what NASA is. Someone on earth would have definitely known.",t3_dvq6g3
f7e67wt,t1_f7e5557,I think they're on another planet and the asteroid was actually sent from Earth! The twist is that this was never on our planet,t3_dvq6g3
f7e6vz5,t1_f7e5557,"NASA faked an asteroid because they probably researched the phenomenon of the ""Hermes (the asteroid) effect"" where if people knew it was their last minutes on Earth, they would maximize their potential of greatness.",t3_dvq6g3
f7e5ia8,t1_f7e5557,To knock out the human race,t3_dvq6g3
f7gno10,t1_f7e5557,"They faked the asteroid so that people would start fixing things, because knowing they would be the end of life there was no need for hate or fear. Read it again.",t3_dvq6g3
f7jb92z,t1_f7e5557,I thought that Aliens had hijacked a NASA transmission and that the pod that fell down was the shuttle they hijacked? Doesn't really make sense when you think about it for too long.,t3_dvq6g3
f7e6h35,t1_f7e5n9j,Thank you. Still working on my writing skills. I tried to leave it semi-open to interpretation. He’s either on an alien planet that humans from Earth have discovered. Or our government and NASA created a false disaster to save the Earth by eradicating humans.,t3_dvq6g3
f7eraou,t1_f7ele9i,">  They routinely socialize loss and privatize gain.

That's such a good point. I've never thought about it in exactly those words but it's totally true.",t3_dvq6g3
f7e4yqt,t1_f7e4npg,"Yes, I struggled with that line to make it clear. He’s celebrating a birthday in his 100’s.",t3_dvq6g3
f7f5dvd,t1_f7eklsa,They sterilized themselves.,t3_dvq6g3
f7erofk,t1_f7eh77p,"That, and assuming that these aliens have the same weird birthday cultures we humans have.

But hey, cakes are cakes. Even extraterrestrial.",t3_dvq6g3
f7f6mub,t1_f7eh77p,"The long life was due to the paradise-like conditions, I figured (the released billionaire money would probably help with human health.) NASA fakes the asteroid in order to create the altruistic human behavior that showed up after it was announced.",t3_dvq6g3
f7e6qo4,t1_f7e6h35,I saw it as they miscalculated how much damage the shuttle/ probe would actually cause.,t3_dvq6g3
f7ec0f7,t1_f7e6h35,"I just noticed that you didn't write ""human"" in the story one time. Pretty hidden little twist :)",t3_dvq6g3
f7ecswu,t1_f7e6h35,That was really good enjoyed it a lot.,t3_dvq6g3
f7fwef8,t1_f7e6h35,"See I thought your writing and the descriptions in the beginning we excellent. Like how you described the anxiety rising, was perfect. I have felt exactly that during panic attacks but never put it to words as well as you have i feel like if you fleshed the middle out and reposted this I'd love to read what comes of it.",t3_dvq6g3
f7feqp3,t1_f7eraou,That hit me too,t3_dvq6g3
f7e6q13,t1_f7e4yqt,Maybe “three numbered candles”?,t3_dvq6g3
f7g305d,t1_f7f5dvd,"Oh right. Well it was a good try, NASA.",t3_dvq6g3
f7gcqad,t1_f7f6mub,That's the meaning I took from it as well. I do like the alien interpretation as well though.,t3_dvq6g3
f7e6xyo,t1_f7e6qo4,"I actually didn’t think of that, that’s also a good one!",t3_dvq6g3
f7en300,t1_f7e6qo4,"Spacecraft are very light, but things like pressure vessels and solar panels could make it seem more voluminous. An asteroid the physical size of the ISS would be a big deal.",t3_dvq6g3
