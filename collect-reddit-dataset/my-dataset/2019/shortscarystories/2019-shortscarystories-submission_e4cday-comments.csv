f9cln8j,t3_e4cday,"Nice, I got the chills! Check out the game ""the static speaks my name"" it's like this story but with creepy visual shit",t3_e4cday

f9cjiq5,t1_f9al32z,The best movie like ever fucking made.,t3_e4cday
f9euafy,t1_f9al32z,Thanks! I'll take that as a compliment. It's fun to explore fans gone crazy through writing. It's such a fine line!,t3_e4cday
f9aeek0,t1_f9a92d4,"Not dead, in OPs basement painting.",t3_e4cday
f9afmcz,t1_f9a92d4,Or dead and all his paintings stolen. Could be either but I prefer/u/ScooberGoober's take.,t3_e4cday
f9cab0w,t1_f9bme72,"I think the artist's still alive, forced to paint for OP :(",t3_e4cday
f9eur05,t1_f9bme72,"‚ÄúThe obituary says he died last year, but I know the truth.‚Äù

This implies that the truth is he did NOT die last year.",t3_e4cday
f9eu4oi,t1_f9cln8j,Sweet! Will do! And thank you!,t3_e4cday

f9bj4db,t1_f9beq1s,Kathy Bates discovers her favorite novelist after a car accident and takes him to her cabin to heal him and then *insists* that he write his novel to her liking. She manages to convince him to stay there and write the book using a very compelling sledgehammer.,t3_e4cday
f9cacbd,t1_f9beq1s,Omg it‚Äôs soooo good. Very suspenseful. If you‚Äôre a horror fan (which I‚Äôm assuming you are if you‚Äôre on this sub) you should definitely read it. Or at least watch the movie. Kathy Bates won an Oscar for it,t3_e4cday
f9bf8r3,t1_f9beq1s,Misery,t3_e4cday
f9jio2o,t1_f9cjiq5,Fun fact: The book was inspired by Stephen King's own disturbing real-life experiences with obsessive fans,t3_e4cday
f9afwcu,t1_f9aeek0,His spirit lives in the painting?,t3_e4cday

f9k7ecp,t1_f9jdj56,"Damn.... 

I don't words to say anything more.....",t3_e4cday
f9bmpjz,t1_f9bj4db,In the book she convinces him by sawing off his feet. She's very persuasive,t3_e4cday
f9bz0bv,t1_f9bj4db,Anyone know how to get their hands on George Martin?,t3_e4cday
f9c39pa,t1_f9bj4db,"""convince""",t3_e4cday
f9dk975,t1_f9bj4db,Ohh I think I saw a lifetime movie recreation?,t3_e4cday
f9cjshb,t1_f9bf8r3,"My name means melancholy, I want to legally change it to Misery because of this movie.",t3_e4cday
f9b9pj4,t1_f9afwcu,"No, he has the artist in his basement, locked up and forever making art only for him. He kidnapped and enslaved the artist.",t3_e4cday
f9fcp6b,t1_f9ew9fx,If that's what they meant they would have said murdered instead of died.,t3_e4cday
