fbshxxo,t3_eeaxq6,"She must have used Duolingo to learn Spanish, when I was 3 years-old, I can't even speak properly, yet alone beg for help.

My 3yo stupidity aside, scary story. The story begins itself by making it seems like the little girl is going to get sold by some human trafficker, but BAM, immigration. A lot of stories that I had read put readers into the perspective of an immigrant, but this is more terrifying as it is coming from just a small child, not knowing why she is being captured. Good story.",t3_eeaxq6
fbt9fga,t3_eeaxq6,Iâ€™m terrified crying. This story is amazing.,t3_eeaxq6
fbu7sxh,t3_eeaxq6,"The story is really well written. But as a french having the main character named zizi is pretty unsettling as Zizi in french means wiener... like wee wee in english if you prefer. But still, the story is great, good good job !!",t3_eeaxq6

fbu7wl7,t1_fbu7sxh,"Origin is Hungarian as a female name, meaning ""Heavenly"". I just used it for a Mexican child as it was always zizi in my head.",t3_eeaxq6
fbuiqw0,t1_fbu7wl7,So you are telling me that in hungarian zizi means heavenly ?? I am sorry this is pretty funny to me.. but i can still enjoy your story as i know that now. Thanks for the info !,t3_eeaxq6
fbumuep,t1_fbuiqw0,"My apologies ""pledged to God"", is the actual phrase and it's a Hungarian and Hebrew name.",t3_eeaxq6
fbv0glg,t1_fbumuep,Ok no problem but it is still interesting to know !,t3_eeaxq6
