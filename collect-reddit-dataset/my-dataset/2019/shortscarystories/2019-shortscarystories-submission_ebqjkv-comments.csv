Office aside, cool story. I have a fear about kidnapping and other similar stuffs, so hearing things like this, and realizing it came from a 13 year old is terrifying.",t3_ebqjkv
fb743o2,t1_fb6xj0k,"Thanks - the intent is not that it's kidnapping, it's that these kids were born and grew up in the basement. The only language they learned was from kids who happened to overhear speech, or from their jailors.",t3_ebqjkv

fb95spm,t1_fb746aw,"Even worse is that it was partly inspired by real life cases. Consider Genie, Danielle Crockett, or the kids of Elisabeth Fritzl (the latter had it a little better since they had a caring mother who could teach and socialize them, so they recovered and adjusted after being rescued. The story itself is way more sick though. (their father was also Elizabeth's father, and the person who kept his daughter in captivity for 24 years so he could rape her until she gave birth to seven kids))",t3_ebqjkv
