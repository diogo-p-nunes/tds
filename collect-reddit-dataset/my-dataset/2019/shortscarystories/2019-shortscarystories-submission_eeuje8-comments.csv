Rat politic aside, good job. Scary, disgusting and weird. When first reading the story, I thought that ""oh, he's going to become the host of the rat king"" but nope, he becomes the rat king. As someone who is disgusted by anything small such as cockroaches, babies and rats, I love this story. Good one.",t3_eeuje8
