f7506hl,t3_duc8o4,"Really enjoyed this, thanku for sharing with us!",t3_duc8o4
f77f4a6,t3_duc8o4,I know the point wasn’t to make a funny story -  but the dark humour in turning that metaphor in on itself made me happier than it should have. Good story mate,t3_duc8o4
f74ol1z,t3_duc8o4,Dayum!!! Amazing ending!!,t3_duc8o4
f771hew,t3_duc8o4,the oh fuck really puts a humourous spin on it! I dig it,t3_duc8o4
f767ufm,t3_duc8o4,"probably one of my favourite stories i’ve read on here, great job",t3_duc8o4
f7693ku,t3_duc8o4,Excellent,t3_duc8o4
f76hvqa,t3_duc8o4,"Love it, has a Death Note feel to it. Good story! 👍",t3_duc8o4
f7706m4,t3_duc8o4,hahahahaha the ending got me,t3_duc8o4
f77fjrd,t3_duc8o4,"One of the greatest ones in a long time. Props, my dude.",t3_duc8o4
f7806x5,t3_duc8o4,Relatable,t3_duc8o4
f76nlkw,t3_duc8o4,lol,t3_duc8o4
f77hx3m,t3_duc8o4,"This was good, great job!",t3_duc8o4
f74pnac,t3_duc8o4,Why did you switch story facts mid story?,t3_duc8o4
f7j3x4m,t3_duc8o4,"Really dig the metaphorical noose being a literal rope tightening and loosening constantly throughout life. I still expected the nooses to end up being metaphorical, and the twist was solid. Nice job!",t3_duc8o4
f9pm0ya,t3_duc8o4,"I would really enjoy reading or even hearing a longer version of this story. If you ever add more, please let me know. I found this story very intriguing.",t3_duc8o4
fa94mmx,t3_duc8o4,"So while other people's nooses show how close they are to killing themselves, your noose is tied to the power itself and forces you to either choose death, actively hurt people, or become a passive bystander while knowing you could have done more...

You sure there wasn't an albatross tied to the end of yours? Because that's a horrifying curse.",t3_duc8o4
f93k8bg,t3_duc8o4,"Hey, just saw this now so i know I'm late to the party, but I just wanted to say i love this story. I really like the metaphor here- I've always dealt with depression and always wanted to save every sad person around me. I've learned now that I can't save other people without dragging my own mental health down. Kind of like drowning yourself to hold their head above water. The way you've illustrated that here, intentionally or not, is a unique and interesting perspective on something not everybody talks about.",t3_duc8o4
f77r2z9,t3_duc8o4,Is this a true story?,t3_duc8o4
f77ehue,t3_duc8o4,"Creepy! I loved it!

I uploaded a [Youtube](https://youtu.be/DRCbvZZppmo) if you want to hear it being read with a creepy atmosphere.",t3_duc8o4
f77f5cf,t1_f74o6mc,This! That was the exact feeling I was left with that I was unable to describe,t3_duc8o4
f74rfkv,t1_f74pnac,I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that,t3_duc8o4
f75jdjb,t1_f74rfkv,"I think they're referring to the fact that you discuss the noose as being metaphorical in the first half of the story, but then imply it is literal near the end when that doesn't really jive with what you'd written previously. 

There's also a few lines early on where you describe them both being happy, and the MC only noticing the noose suddenly appearing and being tight one day, neither occurrence making much sense in light of the rules you'd already established. 

It's pretty common for inconsistencies like this to appear in a first draft, as the author usually hasn't fully fleshed out the world mechanics fully, and this is especially easy to see in a high-concept story like this. 

These flaws are easily rectified upon revision. Overall I like the idea of this story quite a bit and with a few tweaks it could be quite fantastic.",t3_duc8o4
f75l6c7,t1_f75jdjb,"Yeah, I get that there are a few inconstistencies. I'm new to writing short horror and english isn't my first language, so this kind of critisim helps!

And yeah, I could have specified a few things here and there, like maybe with other people it's more methaporical, but with the mc it's a literal noose but I barely got it down to 500 words so no space to explain.

Anyway, I agree with you that if this was longer, more thought out version of this story I would do few things differently. Thank you for your feedback, it really helps!",t3_duc8o4
f77fgos,t1_f75l6c7,"Maybe you should try out a longer version on r/nosleep this kind of story would fit right in over there & there is no maximum story length.

I personally loved this story and can’t imagine how hard it would be to write creatively in a language you’re not native to! I think If you flush out the relationship a bit more. That he’s constantly moody etc rather than just having one moment of madness in high school & explore the MC’s experiences as she realised her rope isn’t metaphorical and try’s to balance out being horrible & cruel to save herself and allow her to breath easy, with not wanting to push anyone over the edge - I think you could create something great!!",t3_duc8o4
f75nejf,t1_f75l6c7,"No worries. I've been writing semi-professionally for about ten years now so I love looking at budding writers' work. 

The 500 word constraint is taxing, to be sure. I had to redraft a [story of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/ddaohz/all_hallows_eve/) three or four times to get within the word limit. It's all about cutting down absolutely all of the fat from the story while ensuring it still flows well.  (I'm not trying to shill my own work, I promise lol)

I realized when writing my story that I front-loaded a lot of the words and that was where I focused, but yours seems to have little snippets throughout that could be trimmed for time. This line for example:

>  Sometimes it looked looser, but the next day it had tightened up again. 

doesn't really say anything that hasn't already been said in the narrative. Cutting it opens up another 13 words, which doesn't sound like much, but can make or break the flow of a story if applied elsewhere. 

English is a shitty, broken pseudo-language that steals bits and pieces from other languages, so don't worry too much about how you sound writing it. You have a very good grasp on it. Let me know if you need a proof-reader or editor for any future submissions, as reading the writing of other people helps me get in the groove when I do my own writing. Cheers!",t3_duc8o4
f75s3o8,t1_f75nejf,"Thank you! If I ever feel stumped, I will be sending my drafts to you!",t3_duc8o4
