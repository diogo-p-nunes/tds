fcimhhy,t3_ehcsxa,"What.

What aside, what.

Jokes aside, good one. Truly ""disgusting"", horrifying, and a little bit funny. Disgusting as in, that girl is going to have sex with her boyfriend's neck. Horrifying as in, Ed is suffocated by an entity in his neck, and who knows if that thing will burst it's seed inside the girl and spread itself around the world. Funny as in, Ed had his girlfriend stolen by a tendril in his throat. Nice story, I hate it since I'm having a sore throat, and love it at the same time.",t3_ehcsxa
