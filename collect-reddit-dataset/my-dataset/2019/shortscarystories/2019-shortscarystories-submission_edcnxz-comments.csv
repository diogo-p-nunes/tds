fbgz2md,t3_edcnxz,"Urgh, makes me cringe. Let it be known that I don't want my insides to be sucked.

Sucking aside, Anorexia is a heartbreaking and terrifying illness. I hope that if anyone here is suffering with it, know that you're beautiful just the way you are and that you have to stop it from controlling you and your vision.  Transforming yourself to a skeleton is never the answer. (Unless you're dating Skeletor)

Edit: Thank you to balter_ and lacrimaeveneris for telling me that anorexia is about control, not beauty.",t3_edcnxz
fbheowj,t3_edcnxz,I thought she was going to end up being pregnant or something.,t3_edcnxz
fbhtz94,t3_edcnxz,"This was heartbreaking. 

Tbh, I used to try and think of ways that I could cut open my stomach and use a vacuum to suck out the fat. This story brought those memories back hard. Great job (I'm not being sarcastic, I really enjoyed this story lol)",t3_edcnxz

fbi9wsm,t3_edcnxz,"My sister is anorexic and it breaks my heart to think that she thinks she isn’t good enough. And it breaks my heart that I can’t do anything about it. And I would give anything for it to be me instead of her because she deserves the world and she’s literally starving herself of it. 

Great story OP, thank you.",t3_edcnxz
fbhpsdd,t3_edcnxz,Saw it coming still gutting (pun intended),t3_edcnxz
fbidfnu,t3_edcnxz,My vice was bulimia. Had to hold myself back from throwing up again and again until my partner found out. The struggle is real.,t3_edcnxz
fbxefdx,t3_edcnxz,When I was younger I used to think I controlled my eating disorder and to this day it still controls me and my every thought.,t3_edcnxz

fbj2lvr,t3_edcnxz,"For anyone who is suffering from anorexia, 
just know that you're beautiful just the way you are and if people around you doesn't appreciate that, instead of changing yourself for their expectations, leave those people behind. You don't need anyone who doesn't love you for who you really are. They dont deserve you if they don't understand that superficial appearance can change anytime but what really matters is who you are inside.",t3_edcnxz
fbjfp0r,t3_edcnxz,Damn it janet,t3_edcnxz
fbjgqiy,t3_edcnxz,"Damn, everyone talking about anorexia, and I honestly thought she was pregnant and deluding herself into believing she was just fat.",t3_edcnxz
fbk0d0c,t3_edcnxz,"oh... Damn...

Why people don't understand that beauty lies within the body and not on the body.",t3_edcnxz
fbtolee,t3_edcnxz,the switch from past to present to past tense was kinda jarring,t3_edcnxz

fbhfl93,t1_fbgz2md,"unfortunately it isnt a beauty thing. its a control thing. 

source: have had eating disorders since i was 13",t3_edcnxz
fbhlb6u,t1_fbgz2md,"It's not about beauty, it's 100% about control. Her skewed image of herself is legitimately what she sees though - what she sees and what you see in some  ways doesn't match. It's a tough disease. And the saddest part is that it starts as exerting control - and then the disease controls the person.",t3_edcnxz
fbkao6a,t1_fbgz2md,"I know others said it's about control but for me it was about beauty. I've never even thought about control while starving myself. All I wanted was to be pretty because if I'm pretty, I'll like myself, right? It's like, inside I technically knew that the other girls weigh more than me but I couldn't help thinking that they're so much skinnier than me. And every time I looked into the mirror and wanted to throw up, I knew I needed to lose more weight, to be pretty, because I saw myself as fat and that was the worst thing I could think of. I've been that way since I was 10 but I only have problems on and off. Sometimes I'm okay but I still hate eating and see food as disgusting, but sometimes I just start starving myself and the thought of eating makes me nearly puke because I feel like I NEED to be skinnier, to be way skinnier, to lose weight, to not be fat. It's always about being pretty with me.",t3_edcnxz
fbhx5x4,t1_fbgz2md,True. You know at the end of the day you have to love yourself. You got to be comfortable with who you are. I’m a mom of a teenage girl and she’s not a size 2. She is almost 6” not thin but she’s healthy and happy she’s learned to care about what she thinks of her body and she doesn’t care about what other people say. She is a beautiful person. Beauty is within you.,t3_edcnxz
fbhjx4h,t1_fbgz2md,Holy hell it's you again! :D,t3_edcnxz
fbi7n47,t1_fbgz2md,I do. I'm really struggling cause I miss so much my lowest weight but ended up in the ward... I'm still at 40kg but I hate the way I look,t3_edcnxz
fbn2wd6,t1_fbgz2md,"If her cheeks are swollen, it may also be bulimia.",t3_edcnxz
fdjwpfn,t1_fbgz2md,My first thought was body dysmorphia (bdd) rather than anorexia.,t3_edcnxz

fbi3xcm,t1_fbhfl93,"Well I mean yes, much of it is control, but t can also be a beauty thing/ start as a beauty thing turned into control 

Source: I tried but people got suspicious",t3_edcnxz
fbhlfse,t1_fbhlb6u,"Yup, a commenter pointed that out. I'm sorry, I forgot to edit the comment @-@",t3_edcnxz
fbiy15h,t1_fbhlb6u,"I had it, and it was never about image. I never had the ""look in the mirror and see a fat person"" problem. I simply felt my life spiraling out of control and just... Stopped eating. Food tasted like sand in my mouth. Maybe it was about control, I don't honestly know. I'm a male, so I never talked to anyone about it. It wasn't until much later that I realized that it was.",t3_edcnxz
fbkb4i8,t1_fbkao6a,"Hey, I hope you're doing okay now! Beauty is within the eye of the beholder, and I'm sure that there's someone out there seeing you as beautiful.

fbh08qc,t1_fbh08es,"Urgh, makes me squinch. Terrorist group it be noted that I don't look for my regions to be sucked.

Consumption subject matter, Eating disorder is a heartrending and terrific ill health. I prospect that if anyone hither is pain with it, pair that you're pulchritudinous fair-and-square the way you are and that well-beings is additional serious than example.  Transforming yourself to a underframe is ne'er the result. (Unless you're chemical analysis Skeletor)

fbkgdkn,t1_fbkb4i8,"Thanks! Yeah, it's hard sometimes because I was raised in an environment where beauty was way more important than health, so I'm still struggling with grasping the importance of health. My grandma always made sure to mock strangers on the street for their weight, height, etc, always talking about looks, even when mocking my classmates. My grandfather made sure to inform me that I'll be fat and have a gigantic ass whenever I ate a chocolate bar. So I became sorta allergic to scales and mirrors, even though I've never been fat myself. But I was always scared that I might be. Since my grandma equated weight to beauty and beauty seemingly to health, my first reaction to not liking something about my appearance is still ""I need to lose weight"" and the same goes whenever somebody tells me I look bad. It's just what I have learned to associate and it's hard to get rid of. Due to this, I also have a hole in logic concerning exercise, since I've been mostly thought that fat and unattractive people need to. So now whenever someone is like ""you should exercise more"" my gut reaction is ""But according to the doctor I'm underweight!"". It's kinda hard to get rid of.",t3_edcnxz
