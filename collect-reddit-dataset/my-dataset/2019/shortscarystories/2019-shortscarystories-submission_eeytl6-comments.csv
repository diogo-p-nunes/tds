fbxf7fk,t3_eeytl6,"Why don't Alex just buy a good noise cancelling headphone? Surely that's cheaper than disposing bodies.

Headphone aside, cool story. The premise of a psycho killing someone because they've done something that insulted them in a minor way is good, as I genuinely want to beat someone that interrupts me when I am talking about the things that they're asking for. Thanks god I know good financial tips, not like Alex over there. Good story, and a nice ending, though there's a bit too much on the details about killing.

Alex also steals his father K/D by saying he killed both of his parent, which is uncool dude.",t3_eeytl6
