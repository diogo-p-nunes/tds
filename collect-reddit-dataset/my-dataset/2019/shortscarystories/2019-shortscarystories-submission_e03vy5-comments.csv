f8dbe4b,t1_f8d90r7,I'm pretty sure that it's saying that in the elevator the slime turned into Parsons by eating him and accidentally got the height wrong.,t3_e03vy5

f8dcm8p,t1_f8dbe4b,"That's what I thought! I thought it was that or somehow it was hiding inside him, making him taller?",t3_e03vy5

f8dx048,t1_f8dcm8p,"Nah, I think it ate him and grew from that and assumed his shape",t3_e03vy5

f8ejull,t1_f8e9xps,"If you can absorb a human being completely in 38 seconds, with no trace other than added height, why not eat the interviewer.",t3_e03vy5
