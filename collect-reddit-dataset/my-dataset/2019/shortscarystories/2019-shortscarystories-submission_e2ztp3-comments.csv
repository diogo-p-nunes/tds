f90xssh,t3_e2ztp3,In Islam this is said to happen with a few differences. The soul stays with the body after death and is aware of everything around it. All the way until the body is buried. Then begins your initial judgment. But you can still hear people if they visit your grave.,t3_e2ztp3

f92fyj3,t1_f90xssh,"So do some Buddhists.  When my friend died,we couldn't move him,and had to stay with him until a certain thing happens to the body,( I think mucus issues from nose or something?) .  then it was ok to move him since his soul was released .  the length of time before the spirit leaves body can vary on the individual.  For him it happened about 3 hours later.  The Buddhist monk who visited with us later that day, said for some people it took like 3 days for the spirit to move on.  

Great story by the way, really played on my fears of being on an endless loop.",t3_e2ztp3
f9zpcem,t1_f90ubox,"This is pretty familiar with a mushroom trip i had in Amsterdam a few years back... That sure is hell and it is waiting for some of us. I got saved when i had given Up and the brightest light appeared and i got sucked right into it. Maybe i was experience both heaven and hell, who knows...",t3_e2ztp3
f93aa99,t1_f9173un,Never heard of it,t3_e2ztp3
f93b4ft,t1_f92fyj3,"Interesting.

Now that you mentioned the loop, there's one more thing I should mention that would actually make this story much much worse.

In Islam it is also said that death is actually extremely painful (other than a few exceptions when it's not). So much that at the end of the world when all life dies and all the angels die, God asks the angel of death to take his own soul and as he begins to do so he says something along the lines of ""if I knew death was so painful I wouldn't have taken any lives. """,t3_e2ztp3
f93wx7p,t1_f93aa99,"Tldr: it's what was in Persia before Islam and has two gods - one good one bad.

It was founded by Zoroaster, and they believe in one loving benevolent deity who reigns over reality, as well as a malevolent, cruel entity (sometimes also a god) who punishes the immoral and causes evil in the world. It's where Islam and Christianity got the idea of Satan. Judaism didn't have such an idea before the influence of Zoroastrianism a few centuries before Islam happened.
They also introduced the idea of a heavenly host and a demonic one.
But that's the historical perspective, not the religous one. If you ask an imam or a priest, they'll give you a very different answer.",t3_e2ztp3
f9aezix,t1_f93b4ft,Really I new all that happens expect for mika’el saying that where’d you get that from,t3_e2ztp3
