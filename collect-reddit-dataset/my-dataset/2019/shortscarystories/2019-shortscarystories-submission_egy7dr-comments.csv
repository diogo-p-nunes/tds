fcb4q5p,t3_egy7dr,"Rule 12 can also be used in any awkward situation, such as a family gathering gone wrong!

""I'm not sure"" aside, nice story. Rules kinda story is always fun, and the mysteriousness of whatever is going on inside that place is intriguing. The story is also creepy, with the file corruption and how it takes place in a ""failed"" goverment facility, meaning something had gone wrong there. There's error in rule 10 and 12, but I'll take it as the guy writing the rules is panicking :p Good one.",t3_egy7dr
fcbxrkl,t3_egy7dr,anyone know where i can find more weird guides like this? i absolutely love this,t3_egy7dr
fcaz7ol,t3_egy7dr,Wow I love the ending this is so good,t3_egy7dr
fcb0fna,t3_egy7dr,This sent chills down my spine. Awesome story!,t3_egy7dr
fcdg7fj,t3_egy7dr,"""caeca tenebris"" means ""blind dark"", and ""ostende veriatis"" means ""show the truth"". Thanks google",t3_egy7dr
fcbe0c1,t3_egy7dr,">repeat “ostende veritatis” until the mirage fades, you should only need to say it once

If you only need to say it once, then why does it say to""repeat"" it?

I'm not sure if this is intentional (to make the directions more strange/incongruous) or not",t3_egy7dr
fcclymo,t3_egy7dr,What does the rule 16 mean?,t3_egy7dr
fcftluh,t3_egy7dr,"this could easily be the ""special containment procedures"" section of an SCP log for an anomalous location... very good!",t3_egy7dr
fccp6rq,t3_egy7dr,Clever use of latin. Had to look it up,t3_egy7dr
fcd1ewq,t3_egy7dr,Rule 4 to 6 remind me of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakble.,t3_egy7dr
fcd8lav,t3_egy7dr,This is so good. I just got claustrophobic reading this! Feels like I’m playing a real life version of a Metro game.,t3_egy7dr
fcfefvm,t3_egy7dr,"Very creepy :D It was very nice :)
Keep up the good work :)",t3_egy7dr
fcknlk0,t3_egy7dr,"Makes you wonder what’s so important that people would go into the tunnel in the first place. It doesn’t mention any work being done in the tunnel itself, so I assume that it’s not a mine. The tunnel just seems to connect points A and B. Assuming that one of these points is deep underground, else people would just go around. What’s going on down there?",t3_egy7dr
fnpmjui,t3_egy7dr,If you would like to hear this story narrated I have it up on YouTube. Feel free to come and check it out. [https://youtu.be/osJ6TMC\_Xaw](https://youtu.be/osJ6TMC_Xaw),t3_egy7dr
fccr87n,t3_egy7dr,Are there mote parts to this?,t3_egy7dr
fcg46mv,t3_egy7dr,"For anyone curious, the first one should mean ""blind darkness"" but I think it's in a really weird declension? From what I know, tenebra is under femina, and tenebris would correspond to feminis, which is either plural dative or plural ablative. In blind darkness and to blind darkness both sounds a bit weird to me, I'm guessing OP wanted either to call out to the darkness or to name the nominative?

The second one is an order meaning ""show the truth!"". I admit I had to look this one up because I really couldn't remember what declension veritas falls under. This one I am not sure, might be correct, but veritatis is the genitive and if I recall correctly, to show uses accusative in Latin, aka whom what, and not whom/whose what/whats, which would be veritatem.",t3_egy7dr
fctj3tc,t3_egy7dr,Creepy. :D,t3_egy7dr
ffnkxtr,t3_egy7dr,I liked your use of latin; seeing the phrase 'caeca tenebris' interested me especially because I'm writing a fantasy story and the name of the human disguise of my main villain (who happens to be a shadow demon) is actually 'Soren Tenebris'.,t3_egy7dr
fcb819h,t1_fcb4q5p,"Thanks! I was hoping you’d comment. I fixed the error, thanks for pointing it out.",t3_egy7dr
fcj3mas,t1_fcb4q5p,So I read this sub in bed every night and I'm starting to look forward to finding your comments,t3_egy7dr
fcd3l5b,t1_fcbxrkl,there is a subreddit that’s MADE for this stuff: r/hgk477,t3_egy7dr
fcccd7k,t1_fcbxrkl,[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepfinder/comments/au7ntd/looking_for_stories_with_lists_or_instructions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is where I got most of the inspiration for a few more stories I’m working on,t3_egy7dr
fcfxhr6,t1_fcbxrkl,"The top posts of this sub have some great examples, like the memo to Disney park workers and the one about the summer camp (the name of which I can't remember, but I heartily recommend it). One of my favorite examples of this format is that story, I think it's called 11Miles. Sorry I'm on my phone and can't link stuff but you should be able to search it.",t3_egy7dr
fcb09xb,t1_fcaz7ol,Thanks,t3_egy7dr
fno6pzk,t1_fcdg7fj,'caeca tenebris' actually means 'blind darkness'. Google Translate is unreliable. 'ostende veritatis' should also be 'ostende veritatem'.,t3_egy7dr
fcbeu93,t1_fcbe0c1,"It’s just saying that you *should* only need to say it once. It’s like saying your car *should* start on the first try, but might not. Or like your chances of getting killed by a cow are *low,* but never zero.",t3_egy7dr

fcfo57u,t1_fccr87n,"No, but I might make a sequel or something in the future",t3_egy7dr
fcg7k1k,t1_fcg46mv,"Yes, both of these translations are correct, but for the first one I was going for kind of making a declaration of some sort, like “darkness is blind”",t3_egy7dr
fcblcwa,t1_fcb819h,"Hooray! Keep on writing, I'd love to see more.",t3_egy7dr
fcj79r5,t1_fcj3mas,Thanks! Though I'm not sure what feeling should I have since your username is very flattering :p hope you'll be having a comfortable sleep after reading a lot of scary stories!,t3_egy7dr

Also I meant that I googled those things",t3_egy7dr
