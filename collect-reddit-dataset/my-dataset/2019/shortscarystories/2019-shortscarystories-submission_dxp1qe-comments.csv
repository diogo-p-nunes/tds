f7v6edo,t3_dxp1qe,"Dude yeah, this is a super awesome story. I would love to read about someone you failed to kill on time, for example. This sub doesn't allow world-building, but maybe on r/nosleep? Anyway, keep it up!",t3_dxp1qe
f7u3a6n,t3_dxp1qe,"Hey guys. It's my first time posting here, so please tell me where I can improve, and also point out any stupid errors so that I can edit. I hope you enjoy, and I also hope this is an original idea. ü§û",t3_dxp1qe
f7wxipp,t3_dxp1qe,I'm 26 but you can come now bro.,t3_dxp1qe
f7xb4fv,t3_dxp1qe,What about all the old people that die locked alone in their homes or in public places?,t3_dxp1qe
f7wkv2z,t3_dxp1qe,"Wait so you‚Äôre telling me if it wasn‚Äôt for this disease I would live forever? Well boy am I sure glad I have it, I already want to die couldn‚Äôt imagine living forever.",t3_dxp1qe
f7wuyke,t3_dxp1qe,I'd like it more if the plague simply was aging,t3_dxp1qe
f7vapgj,t3_dxp1qe,Love the scope of this one.,t3_dxp1qe
f7w20nc,t3_dxp1qe,"This sort of reminds me of something I'm working on. Both stories deal with immortality, just differently. Great story in any case. I didn't intend to plug my story into this, but just ask if you want to read it.",t3_dxp1qe
f7woq2e,t3_dxp1qe,"I love this, I would suggest portraying yourself as conscientious objector of sorts. Like you're trying to find a cure to stop the killing and the plague. Like maybe, someone you love is near that point. Maybe something has gone wrong and a young family member is prematurely aging and you've been hiding them and you've been ordered to hand them over. Ooh, that would be good. Could this plague be the origin of zombies?",t3_dxp1qe
f7wty2h,t3_dxp1qe,"Pharo-> Pharaoh. Other than that, great read!",t3_dxp1qe
f7x2wgz,t3_dxp1qe,This is awesome!! Great work!,t3_dxp1qe
f7x350u,t3_dxp1qe,What if he knows something we don‚Äôt and we all think this is just some made up story,t3_dxp1qe
f7xao1h,t3_dxp1qe,"If this were a book, I would read the shit out of it! Awesome read!",t3_dxp1qe
f7xeyad,t3_dxp1qe,This reminded me of the technovirus from snow crash.,t3_dxp1qe
f7xhu6v,t3_dxp1qe,"I‚Äôm not so much of a poster or commenter, more or less a lurker. . But I felt like I should let you know this is probably one of my favorites I have read thus far in this sub! It had me gripped and I wish there was more, just wanted to say well done!",t3_dxp1qe
f7xo6ke,t3_dxp1qe,This is great! one of the best ones I've seen on this subreddit,t3_dxp1qe
f7ynjrr,t3_dxp1qe,"I honestly don't find this scary or threatening.  If I'm old, sick and tired, I would want someone to euthanize me.  I'm sure there are tens of thousands of old people and people of all ages that want to commit suicide that would love to have this guy come and kill them.",t3_dxp1qe
f8r6fjw,t3_dxp1qe,"Thank you again for letting me narrate this story on my podcast! here is a link for you to hear it.

Great story! thank you!  hope you like it!",t3_dxp1qe
fb5jfj9,t3_dxp1qe,ugh thats a operations nightmare.,t3_dxp1qe
fg0t5j2,t3_dxp1qe,"Apeirophobia tho, so thank you kind stranger.",t3_dxp1qe
f7v8uty,t3_dxp1qe,"I'm in love with the idea you're getting at here! It'd be interesting to have a sequel/partner post about how the government deals with people who die outside of a hospital setting. Like if an elderly lady is in bed rest at her house, how would she be killed? Or would she turn? I can't wait to see what's next!",t3_dxp1qe
f7vqw5l,t3_dxp1qe,"I personally like the tone shift. It turns a ""warning"" story into a ""I help save the world"" story.",t3_dxp1qe
f7vrl2u,t3_dxp1qe,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

f7wa3jr,t3_dxp1qe,The great pestilence,t3_dxp1qe
f7wjbzb,t3_dxp1qe,"if that‚Äôs the case, then thank you. i would absolutely hate to live forever.",t3_dxp1qe
f7wtit1,t3_dxp1qe,Great concept. It would be a great book. I see it being a mystery adventure called something like ‚ÄúThe Secret Agent at the End of the World‚Äù or something like that.,t3_dxp1qe
f88zpnu,t3_dxp1qe,"great story, proud to be the 1000th upvote :)",t3_dxp1qe
f7xma0w,t3_dxp1qe,Does anyone know y we die of an old age tho damnn,t3_dxp1qe
f7vau52,t1_f7v6edo,"Thanks. There a few errors in this that are quite prominent when you know about them. I am going to post a fixed version tomorrow, and then I could maybe do some more stuff in this world later. Good advice with the r/nosleep   Thank you again.",t3_dxp1qe
f7ugp6t,t1_f7u3a6n,"I really like this story. it's got an interesting concept, and the build up is good. The only thing I noticed is there is a big tone shift from the first paragraph and the last. In the first, it feels like this is something the world needs to know, something terrible that threatens everyone (which you then establish very well). However, the last sentence seems a bit jarring. You go from this warning, and concern, to a threat, which doesn't really seem cohesive. A different ending (but not necessarily better- this is just personal opinion) may have been to take out that last sentence, and put something about being overwhelmed by the number of deaths, or the plague mutating beyond the operative's control, so that fear and worry from the beginning really hits home at the end.",t3_dxp1qe
f7w7ku7,t1_f7u3a6n,This is a really strong concept. It‚Äôs rare to see something genuinely original.,t3_dxp1qe
f7x3d0f,t1_f7u3a6n,"This story was written so well, I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it was your first if you didn‚Äôt say. Well done! Continue writting, I look forward to seeing more short stories from you.üòä",t3_dxp1qe
f9of823,t1_f7u3a6n,"This is great. I have a very minor edit (and maybe it‚Äôs not a mistake). You wrote ‚Äúrealised‚Äù and then wrote that the character was based in New York. A US-born agent would write ‚Äúrealized.‚Äù You might not be American, but the person ‚Äúwriting‚Äù this narrative is, so you have to use American grammar, words, and style.

Oh yeah, we also put punctuation within quotes so: ‚Äúold age.‚Äù Instead of ‚Äúold age‚Äù.",t3_dxp1qe
f7yntxj,t1_f7wxipp,That's what I was saying.  This isn't really scary or threatening because there would be hundreds of thousands and millions of people of all ages around the world who would gladly let this guy kill them haha,t3_dxp1qe
f81oynp,t1_f7xb4fv,"They were never alone, just left as is to keep the ruse",t3_dxp1qe
f81ozmm,t1_f7xb4fv,"They were never alone, just left as is to keep the ruse",t3_dxp1qe
f7xkllh,t1_f7wkv2z,"Immortal doesn't mean invincible. You could always end yourself, or be ended by someone else, like in the story.",t3_dxp1qe
f7xhybb,t1_f7wty2h,Thanks. Edited.,t3_dxp1qe
f7x9kp2,t1_f7v8uty,"A few changes here & there, this plague virus that was brought to earth could be made into a SCP by itself. The foundation could be there ones that send a Task force  to deal with the newly turned.",t3_dxp1qe
f7vv844,t1_f7vqw5l,"Thank you. I am open to all suggestions, and while I will leave this one as it is, I'm editing an alternative one currently to post tomorrow.",t3_dxp1qe
f891icu,t1_f88zpnu,"Thank you. I was checking earlier today, and was wondering if it would make 1k",t3_dxp1qe
f7vb3te,t1_f7vau52,"Well, I look forward to reading more from you, consider me a follower",t3_dxp1qe
f7xkmmv,t1_f7vau52,Remind me please brotha,t3_dxp1qe
f7uhto4,t1_f7ugp6t,"Thank you so much. That is an amazing idea, and very well pointed out. That tone shift is blaring obvious so thank you very much for pointing it out. I‚Äôll probably do the reviewed version tomorrow so thank you",t3_dxp1qe
f9pd273,t1_f9of823,That‚Äôs a very good point. I‚Äôm English so of course this slipped past or. I‚Äôll change that now.,t3_dxp1qe
f808afp,t1_f7yntxj,"Everyone on Twitter, that's for sure.",t3_dxp1qe
f7xd73t,t1_f7x9kp2,I like this. I might make it into an SCP now. Thanks for the idea.,t3_dxp1qe
f7vbh64,t1_f7vb3te,Wow. Thank you very much.,t3_dxp1qe
f81ouh8,t1_f7xkmmv,Me too,t3_dxp1qe
