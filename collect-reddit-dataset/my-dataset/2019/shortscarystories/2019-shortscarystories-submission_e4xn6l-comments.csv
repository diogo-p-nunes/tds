f9gmvrg,t3_e4xn6l,I kinda don't get it..,t3_e4xn6l
f9gzwkx,t3_e4xn6l,The little brother meets scratch before he go to sleep so he’s saying seize the opportunity to kill him then,t3_e4xn6l
f9hcp4s,t3_e4xn6l,I think I get it. The family attracts monsters. Scratch is killing the dogs so the dad is going to trap it in the doghouse.,t3_e4xn6l
f9gt6t8,t3_e4xn6l,I don't get the ending at all. I assume the brother meets Scratch right before going to sleep. Are we to assume the brother kills the dogs?,t3_e4xn6l
f9gni31,t1_f9gmvrg,The nugget is dog meat but I didn’t understand the rest.,t3_e4xn6l
f9nrzxg,t1_f9gt6t8,"No, Scratch kills the dogs. And the brother is meeting Scratch before sleep. So now they‘ll kill Scratch.",t3_e4xn6l
f9grtav,t1_f9gni31,Yeah.. Like who meets scratch before going to sleep? The dog or the kid?,t3_e4xn6l
f9i9j3k,t1_f9grtav,"The kid, and it's implied that kids in this family attract or create monstrous creatures from their imagination, and this isn't the first, which is why the father is kinda traumatized and doesn't want to hear about it, but will do what has to be done. Scratch is a friend to the kid, but it's also a dangerous carnivorous predator, who goes and eats dogs in the neighborhood, then brings them to the kid who created Scratch as a gift.",t3_e4xn6l
f9igui1,t1_f9i9j3k,Oh. Thanks OP!!,t3_e4xn6l
