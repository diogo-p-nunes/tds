f8qz867,t3_e1osad,i couldn't wait till you'd get to the reveal of it being humans so you'd stop writing the word 'sheep' so much,t3_e1osad
f8rw0xh,t3_e1osad,"I mean Thanksgiving is a fucked up lie and probably should be replaced with something less based on biological warfare, rape, child abduction, and genocide.

America is evil... or at least was.",t3_e1osad
f8t80kp,t3_e1osad,"I love the story, and the twist. It's good and flows naturally which is really important.",t3_e1osad
f8wvg5r,t3_e1osad,"As a European, I always thought it's rather fucked up that Americans celebrate killing natives, stealing their lands, raping their women, bringing contagious diseases, alcohol, and eventually leave them in reservations to starve to death, by overeating, and getting drunk. It's like, celebrating that day by itself seems already fucked up enough, but they add insult to injury, yet nobody every seems to think about this aspect, I don't even see the ""hippie"" butthurt people calling it out for being insensitive and fucked up, which is weird, cause people seem to be happy to protest against almost everything... but for Thanksgiving they all sweep it under the carpet? Sorry, as usual I went into a ramble. Anyway, very good story, really enjoyed it!",t3_e1osad
f8r4zdd,t1_f8qz867,I'm feeling a little sheepish now,t3_e1osad
f8rlcj8,t1_f8qz867,"After reading your comment, and rereading my story, i got annoyed as well. Thanks for the feedback, made some changes.",t3_e1osad
f8wy5yb,t1_f8wvg5r,"Dobt apologize for rambling, cause i get it. Im half Navajo and it just confuses me how people nitpick the good stuff to a holiday and ignore all the awful stuff. Some people dont even rwalize how many natives are still around today, or the hardships many families face with poverty and abuse. We have the highest suicide rate out of any ethnicity in the U.S. but it's none of the invaders descendants concern.",t3_e1osad
f8ye7sm,t1_f8wy5yb,"I was reading all the stories of this year's contest to find one to narrate on my channel (same name as here) for today, this one is by far my favorite, do you mind if I narrate it? I'll of course link it in the description and credit your name in the title! And then link it to you once it's up :)",t3_e1osad
