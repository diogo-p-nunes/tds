f7apkxx,t3_dv031v,"Totally thought the dress, when reading! Great take on it! Super excited for more to read from you!!",t3_dv031v
f7akkky,t3_dv031v,The *dress*,t3_dv031v
f7aqrir,t3_dv031v,Fuck that's so creative. At first I was like is this gonna be like that blue dress/gold dress bullshit? Lol this is much cooler,t3_dv031v
f7akhxe,t3_dv031v,Dude. That was good. I would totally watch that movie. With John Cusack as the journalist. (or Jeff Goldblum),t3_dv031v
f7avsil,t3_dv031v,"Very cool and unique story! You did a great job creating this, considering the word limit",t3_dv031v
f7aufsc,t3_dv031v,"this deserves the name scary, it genuinely scared me and that's hard. 1 note: it would sound better if it said: ""now you don't"" idk why but for me it would.",t3_dv031v
f7asd8g,t3_dv031v,"That made me really uncomfortable, good job",t3_dv031v
f7appha,t3_dv031v,really cool concept i like it,t3_dv031v
f7ay8ll,t3_dv031v,Would have been better without the sun thingy,t3_dv031v
f7ayxtc,t3_dv031v,"It was awesome and the idea is great, got me chilled abit.

Only at the end it seemed that only 10 people could see it, i didnt got that earlier, i thought like 50% could see it 50% couldn't.

For only 10 people to see it it would not be believable because there are only 10 people, and everyone would say they are seeing ghosts and its not real, and there where some other small details :)

But loved it non the less!",t3_dv031v
f7baj5v,t3_dv031v,Oh no it's Yanny everyone run,t3_dv031v

f7b1g99,t3_dv031v,"Great job, looking forward to more of your work.",t3_dv031v
f7b448u,t3_dv031v,Wow! Pretty unusual but very cool prompt. I already thought this dress picture was strange,t3_dv031v
f7b7d3j,t3_dv031v,"Ahh this is incredible, pls write more",t3_dv031v
f7bi7a1,t3_dv031v,Yeah... This is a pretty good story...,t3_dv031v
f7blzuy,t3_dv031v,"For some reason, I thought this was on the TOMT subreddit and I was starting to get real freaked out.",t3_dv031v
f7bqepn,t3_dv031v,"Bro this is amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if this started a trend of ""can you see ___"" stories. Really creative and good.",t3_dv031v
f7bqm4b,t3_dv031v,This messed with me so much. Full on creepy. Well done!,t3_dv031v
f7brz05,t3_dv031v,"Solid story. You built things up fairly well in the short word count. Glad to hear people are revising these before submitting them, lots of people just post whatever they can as soon as they write it.

Havng read the comments, I understand why you included the sun vanishing, but personally, within the context of the story it kind of comes out of nowhere. I'd either revise the story again and thread it through a little more so that the reveal feels more natural, or cut it and come up with something that matches the photos a little more closely. The fact that the initial photo is taken at night but she expects us to not be able to see her when the sun disappears kind of conflicts with itself.

That being said, you clearly put quite a lot of thought and effort into this, and it shows. I look forward to seeing more of your work.",t3_dv031v
f7bu0w5,t3_dv031v,Bro i first thought that this was real until I read the comments lol really gave me the chills,t3_dv031v
f7bzzyh,t3_dv031v,This is really cool. Pretty creepy.,t3_dv031v
f7dl1gb,t3_dv031v,"Given the elements of a cave, a flayed horse, and a girl associated with the sun, were you influenced by the Shinto goddess Amaterasu by any chance?",t3_dv031v
f7azg66,t3_dv031v,Should be11 people? Good story.,t3_dv031v
f7zufxg,t3_dv031v,That girl was John Cena,t3_dv031v
f8sfa02,t3_dv031v,I was lurking around reddit and stumbled upon this. Jesus man. Scared the shit out me.,t3_dv031v
f9a3hgp,t3_dv031v,"Cool story, what is sulking tho? Like crying?",t3_dv031v
fhmomyh,t3_dv031v,"Nicely done!

Question though, is the sun gone, or not providing any radiation, or simply providing no visible light?

I ask this for a good reason. If the sun is GONE then our planet goes spinning off into the void, likely colliding with other matter on our way out. The tidal effects alone, rapidly fluctuating thanks to the change in position and loss of the sun's mass, would wipe out the overwhelming majority of humanity fairly quick.

If the sun isn't providing any radiation, then we stay in orbit, but slowly freeze to death. Likely a couple weeks at best before the vast majority of the world is uninhabitable. Infrared light is what transfers heat, after all.

Now if the sun simply doesn't produce visible light (i.e. 400-700 nm), our death is slower still. Temperatures won't plummet, but any photosynthetic plants will slowly die, since visible light is usually what they need for their process according to a quick Google search. 

So if the sun is GONE, tidal forces and the like rapidly kill off humanity, and anyone who survives freezes to death very soon. If solar radiation is gone instead we freeze to death, though we don't have to worry about the tidal forces. And if only visible light is gone, we live long enough for the food web to collapse as photosynthetic plants starve.",t3_dv031v
f7ah0vz,t1_f7ae4jw,Thanks!,t3_dv031v
f7ajt11,t1_f7ae4jw,The journalist must have missed the person who saw the letter T!,t3_dv031v
f7bweh2,t1_f7ae4jw,I got her chills,t3_dv031v
f7ah64x,t1_f7agb07,"Thank you! This is the first time I'm posting here, thanks for the encouragement!",t3_dv031v
f7awogj,t1_f7apkxx,"Thanks, I am really glad!",t3_dv031v
f7al22j,t1_f7akkky,"Yes, I was partially inspired by that phenomenon. Thank you for catching on!",t3_dv031v
f7awu8j,t1_f7aqrir,"Thank you for the compliments! I think the dress is a cool phenomenon by itself, so I owe it for the idea haha",t3_dv031v
f7akxbr,t1_f7akhxe,"Jeff Goldblum, wow! 
That's beyond my imagination. Thanks!",t3_dv031v
f7b0k5u,t1_f7akhxe,"Nah, Goldblum would be one of the scientists with a crazy theory he's working on as to what causes it that never pans out.",t3_dv031v
f7ax5vh,t1_f7avsil,"I deleted almost a hundred words from my first draft, so this is as compressed as I could get. Thank youÔºÅ",t3_dv031v
f7awzcx,t1_f7aufsc,"I use ""can't"" since I think it sounds consistent to the caption ""can"", but thanks for the feedback!",t3_dv031v
f7ax09l,t1_f7asd8g,Thank you!,t3_dv031v
f7azh0g,t1_f7ay8ll,"Thank you for the feedback! The thing is, the sun theme is important for the story, since my other inspiration for it comes from the tale of Japanese goddess of sun, Amaterasu. The myth said that Amaterasu once hid herself inside a cave, and because of that the world fell into a perpetual night. I tried to put my own spin on that haha

The other reason is I don't want to make it a story where  only half of the population get a curse and die a quick death. Without sun, humanity will die out slower, in a more uncomfortable manner.",t3_dv031v
f7b012c,t1_f7ayxtc,"Thanks for the feedback! Yeah I guess it's a bit hard to make it clearer there. My original intention is to have the number of people who can see the girl dwindles for every photograph iteration, and finally we only have ten people left who can see the picture (and even those ten didn't have the girl in their visions). It serves as some sort of exponential countdown for the 'blackout'.

Glad you still like it!",t3_dv031v
f7azpde,t1_f7ayxtc,Only 10 people could see the LAST photo. Before it was about 50-50 I think,t3_dv031v
f7giyv9,t1_f7baj5v,Laurel,t3_dv031v
f7bw0y1,t1_f7brz05,"Thanks for your feedback! Yes, I guess the vanishing sun does feel like it comes out of the blue. I really wish I could put in more details though. I gave it a go since I thought I already put in small things that wouldn't be noticed upon first reading; yellow attire, 'sun' hat, and even more obscure ones (river/left bank, repetition of number three, cave, and flayed horse which are references to Amaterasu) but on second thought maybe it is indeed not enough. Something to work on in the next story haha

Oh, and it's the same problem again, unclear details: the first photo was posted at night, but the photograph itself was taken at midday. Like a normal girl on a picnic, kind of. My fault, I guess.",t3_dv031v
f7bwdea,t1_f7bu0w5,"Stop it, you flatter me. Thank you!",t3_dv031v
f7dlonb,t1_f7dl1gb,"Yes, I explained in the comments above. Those are references to Amaterasu I deliberately put in, since I was trying to put my own spin on the myth. Glad you noticed!",t3_dv031v
f7aznep,t1_f7azg66,"Ten because there's no apostrophe, it's just added by the journalist. And the journalist himself couldn't see the picture lol. Thank you!",t3_dv031v
f9jjt3t,t1_f9a3hgp,Kind of like pouting,t3_dv031v
f7al56k,t1_f7al22j,Very good take on it. I enjoyed this and it thoroughly creeped me out.,t3_dv031v
f7bfoy6,t1_f7awu8j,This story had a much better resolution üòÇüôè,t3_dv031v
f7axc68,t1_f7ax5vh,"Yeah, I've written stories here so I knew how difficult is to trim your story, but your story felt complete!",t3_dv031v
f7b0aiu,t1_f7awzcx,"Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect you‚Äôd have put that much thought into the wording.
For what it‚Äôs worth, I personally much prefer can‚Äôt than don‚Äôt. Although without you mentioning the connection to the caption I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell you why.

You‚Äôre a great writer. I hope all this love has inspired you to write more and/or given you the confidence to share more stories - I think you could go far.",t3_dv031v
f7b2v8o,t1_f7awzcx,damn! that's really well thought. keep writing like this!üëç,t3_dv031v
f7b4wsd,t1_f7azh0g,Nah dude... everything dies REAL QUICK with no sun. You‚Äôre basically dropping the whole planet in a bucket of ice water - the rapid global freezing will do the job well before other concerns like starvation or lack of oxygen from all the plants dying off from failure to photosynthesize.,t3_dv031v

f7b0gnf,t1_f7b012c,"Thanks for your comment, i understand the 500 words also makes it alot harder.

I also like to write short stories but they are still alot more than 500 words, so you have to cut out things you want to write.

But it makes you better at making a point with a small amount of words and that is a skill that is very helpfull in writing short or longer stories.

And the best thing of your stories was that i was completly interesting and wanted to know what the end would be, that is also very important :)",t3_dv031v
f7de6o1,t1_f7bw0y1,"Gotcha. I find brevity is key with this sub, having a single idea with a single twist gives you the most room to fiddle around, word-count-wise.",t3_dv031v
f7b16ul,t1_f7b0aiu,I am really grateful for your kind words! I'll keep trying to improve myself!,t3_dv031v
f7b71yr,t1_f7b4wsd,"Thank you for the details! Yes, I understand. I was under impression that if humanity died out of a curse they will die very, very soon, like almost instantly or after some agonizing hours, maybe a day at most. Unless it's a curse meant to torture *coughcancercough*

But dying caused by the absence of sun doesn't happen instantly. Sure temperature will drop very quick„Éºand that's what will kill us first, I agree„Éºbut it won't happen in a day. We still have Earth's atmosphere that still traps some heat, so I think we will freeze in a couple of weeks. Not that slow, but compared to the instant death I described above it's still slower. And real uncomfortable, considering the psychological factor of knowing an impending doom you can't do anything about. The despair...

That's my initial thoughts on this matter, but do correct me if my assessment is wrong though, I'm here to learn!",t3_dv031v
f7b0oc6,t1_f7azl07,"I guess it can also be assumed that it's not a godly punishment because humanity did wrong or failed a test. It's more of the higher power do it simply because they can. Like some humans crushing ants just for fun haha

But that's just my interpretation, you can always have your own too. Thank you very much!",t3_dv031v
f7b0nfl,t1_f7azl07,"Do you mean to seem like your shitposting? You have 3 previous posts: 1 was removed because you tried to copy a news article and pass it off as a story & the other 2 are really awful & confusing ‚Äústories‚Äù that don‚Äôt make sense. And now your telling OP that the whole premise of their story is wrong and that they need to take time to answer questions when they already responded to you. 
What‚Äôs the deal? Are you just not quite getting you msg across/don‚Äôt grasp English very well or are you trying to stir the pot?",t3_dv031v
