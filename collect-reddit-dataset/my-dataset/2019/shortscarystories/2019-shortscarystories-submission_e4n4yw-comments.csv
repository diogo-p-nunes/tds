f9e4obr,t3_e4n4yw,"in the beginning, the neighbor says OP murdered someone. who was it?",t3_e4n4yw
f9e7t75,t3_e4n4yw,It looks like your neighbor was a little crazy with the ketchup last night.,t3_e4n4yw
f9eeg0u,t3_e4n4yw,I thought the twist would be that his ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù is actually a second personality. Still a great story though üëç,t3_e4n4yw
f9e8mdx,t3_e4n4yw,"Alternate ending: neighbor jumps out in front of cops, ""it's just a prank, bro!""

cops start laughing.

crowd starts laughing.

aHahahAHah",t3_e4n4yw
f9dswjs,t3_e4n4yw,Nice story. Loved it,t3_e4n4yw
f9es56d,t3_e4n4yw,"So, is this to say that in that half-hour, the neighbor covered his walls with blood and threw body parts everywhere without his knowledge?",t3_e4n4yw
f9sftoj,t3_e4n4yw,"It's 2019 and people are still using the R-slur? Not awesome. 
Good story though. I didn't see that twist coming at all!",t3_e4n4yw
f9gyf83,t3_e4n4yw,"He was framed. I know how the framing was done. The neighbor was the killer and then he put the body parts in his house with no trace of his DNA because he wore gloves and while the guy was sleeping he gently put his hands on it so he wouldn't wake up. Then with a phone call, the neighbor had done the job. He actually got away with it.",t3_e4n4yw
f9kpi1j,t3_e4n4yw,"I thought this would go down the route of ‚ÄúOP was the killer all along‚Äù, but I likes this one. <3",t3_e4n4yw
f9fatim,t3_e4n4yw,"Well done! Good story, with a novel twist at the end. Loved it. Please, more!",t3_e4n4yw
f9gzx5k,t3_e4n4yw,"This story isn't so great. Why would there still be red stains on the neighbor's nails when the main guy is going to prison? Also, the protagonist is a killer but, that's not expanded on at all and we have to believe that the neighbor was able to get these body parts and blood into another person's house while they were sleeping? Um no.",t3_e4n4yw
f9fmoir,t3_e4n4yw,So neighbour was planning it from long to hide his dirt under your door mate.,t3_e4n4yw
f9ejvxb,t1_f9e4obr,My guess is someone in the neighbor's family died and they're blaming it on him,t3_e4n4yw
f9f4n0a,t1_f9e4obr,It was the neighbour. He said that to cover his own butt.,t3_e4n4yw
f9gibb5,t1_f9e4obr,"OP murdurered no one, the neighbour is paranoid and acts on it.",t3_e4n4yw
f9fhs3a,t1_f9e4obr,"This isn't NoSleep. OP doesn't need to pretend this story happened. This is purely a work of fiction.

Now that I got that out of the way: the point of the story is that the neighbor is incriminating the protagonist. Who it was isn't relevant to the story, so that's up to your imagination.",t3_e4n4yw
f9efm7s,t1_f9eeg0u,Could still be a viable interpretation!,t3_e4n4yw
f9gi7k3,t1_f9eeg0u,Wow hadn't even considered such twist,t3_e4n4yw
f9gvfwg,t1_f9eeg0u,Yes that'd have been a great one though,t3_e4n4yw
f9qphly,t1_f9eeg0u,"I , too, thought this - reminds me of Skitz Kraven's song ""Skitz"" same kind of this - it's awesome!",t3_e4n4yw
f9f07rj,t1_f9e8mdx,And everyone started clapping,t3_e4n4yw
f9gi6ok,t1_f9e8mdx,"There is a camera, and there is a camera!",t3_e4n4yw
f9ehc5t,t1_f9e8mdx,LMAO,t3_e4n4yw
f9f6b80,t1_f9es56d,"No, it's to say that the neighbor didn't wash his hands for the two years from arrest to sentencing.",t3_e4n4yw
f9gq9j5,t1_f9es56d,"Don't forget the bone saw that the neighbor *somehow* got the narrator's DNA on (without getting any of his own DNA on), and *somehow* managed to hide in the narrator's floor without the narrator finding out.

I'm also confused. None of it was explained either. 

Not trying to be a dick, but why does this story have 800+ upvotes? It has the same feel of so many other stories on here‚Äîas if OP had the beginning of a good idea, but unfortunately didn't know what to do with it.

The story titled ""Nature"" is much better-written and creepier than this one, but barely has 100 upvotes. What gives?",t3_e4n4yw
f9gi8y5,t1_f9es56d,"Its possible, did it once for my brother, its tight but doable.",t3_e4n4yw
f9j7k4h,t1_f9gyf83,yeah a lot of people don't seem to get it.,t3_e4n4yw
f9j7dbb,t1_f9gzx5k,The protagonist is innocent and being framed by his neighbour.,t3_e4n4yw
f9g2f7f,t1_f9fmoir,You mean door mat or,t3_e4n4yw
f9f6hrv,t1_f9f4n0a,"no, i meant who died.",t3_e4n4yw
f9fiu5w,t1_f9fhs3a,they weren‚Äôt asking OP to reply in character.,t3_e4n4yw
f9fat24,t1_f9f07rj,And that neighbour's name?,t3_e4n4yw
f9gqjzu,t1_f9gq9j5,My thoughts exactly.,t3_e4n4yw
f9gyp8v,t1_f9gq9j5,look at my comment,t3_e4n4yw
f9nc7p0,t1_f9j7k4h,oh well,t3_e4n4yw
f9g3snb,t1_f9g2f7f,"No ""door mate"" makes cents",t3_e4n4yw
f9gb4jf,t1_f9g2f7f,Ya I mean he wanted his dirty work to blamed on you... :),t3_e4n4yw
fjat6uh,t1_f9fiu5w,"Thought so, just added that to see if that was the case because some people, bless their hearts, think that the r/NoSleep rule of staying in character applies to other horror story subreddits.",t3_e4n4yw
f9fcnyw,t1_f9fat24,Ted Cruz.. ü§£ü§£,t3_e4n4yw
f9genpd,t1_f9fat24,Jake Paul,t3_e4n4yw
f9gyka2,t1_f9fat24,Joe,t3_e4n4yw
f9hp7gc,t1_f9gyp8v,"...Ok? 

Even if the neighbor wore gloves, it's still a really fucking absurd premise that the neighbor somehow broke into the narrator's house (without leaving evidence of a break-in) and set up an entire crime scene in a short period of time without the guy waking up, or without any trace of evidence that it was a set-up.",t3_e4n4yw
