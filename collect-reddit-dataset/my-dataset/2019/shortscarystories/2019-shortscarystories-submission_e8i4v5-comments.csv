fagt040,t3_e8i4v5,"What a great story. Your writing is of some of the best quality I've seen on this sub. And what a great twist too! At first, I was thinking the narrator was a shadow person but the clues you left there at the end were just subtle enough for me to determine otherwise. Was it a werewolf, I wonder? Or something worse? Great job. Your talent is not lost on me.",t3_e8i4v5
