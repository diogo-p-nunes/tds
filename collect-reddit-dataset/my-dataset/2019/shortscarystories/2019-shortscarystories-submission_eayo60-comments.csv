fb0z61a,t3_eayo60,"I suppose it's scary in the existential way, in that the life of a loved one being so badly affected by your death is scary.  If I understand it correctly. Not sure if I do though.  Are the narrator and the ""you"" both junkies and that's why narrator died? Or is this a parent/spouse who died and left the dependent/partner alone who then grieved and lost control over their life?  Anyway I suppose that part can be something we fill in for ourselves.",t3_eayo60

fb2oo56,t1_fb2ifbs,"I was going to make some badly placed joke about life beginning at conception but this is too sad a topic, I have a friend who's pregnant wife died of cancer they diagnosed while she was pregnant and then died at childbirth.  Her husband then lost an older brother not long after that, I forget why.  Not really a jokey topic.

Now I'm very sad.  Reminds me of a funny comment I just heard ""your jokes are like onions, so many layers, and they always make me cry""",t3_eayo60
