fao5sa7,t1_fang5ln,Thanks,t3_ea16ch
fao5ukb,t1_fanwm6m,Thanks I wanted to divert from the usual plot,t3_ea16ch
fasmuc1,t1_fapz4la,Seriously. Those mapping apps aren’t perfect. Just because the gps gave the driver wrong directions is no reason to murder him for it. :(,t3_ea16ch
faok9gy,t1_faoh3cv,I don’t either. A lot of the stories that get tons of upvotes on here I don’t get.,t3_ea16ch
faokdu4,t1_faoh3cv,"From what I understand, he was originally going to go ""meet"" someone (but really, to kill them). However,  his taxi driver ended up trying to kidnap him, so that explains the ending: he's now killing both the suspicious driver and his original target, whoever that is.",t3_ea16ch
faoku1b,t1_faoh3cv,I think he murders murderers.,t3_ea16ch

faozomj,t1_faokdu4,"I kinda doubt it was a ""he"" being kidnapped, but I guess it's totally possible",t3_ea16ch
faps83i,t1_faokdu4,">However, his taxi driver ended up trying to kidnap him

Lol i thought he controlled the driver's mind to get him to somewhere desolated and then kill him",t3_ea16ch
fap566o,t1_fap3cy7,"I loved it, keep up the good work",t3_ea16ch
fap2765,t1_faozomj,"Haha yeah, I assumed that, my apologies.",t3_ea16ch
