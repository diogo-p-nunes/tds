fcoim4m,t3_ei5xam,"See, this is why we should strive to get out of the closet. Not because of sexuality, but because we might rock on with Satan.

Closet aside, cool story. A tad bit funny with the narrator being the equivalent of a mentally-challanged potato, but it's still spooky. I also like the ""three sharp pokes"" line, as it probably tells us that the demon is fed up from this random person sitting in the middle of his living room and jamming it out. Not that scary, but a nice one regardless.",t3_ei5xam
