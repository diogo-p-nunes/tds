f7xi87h,t3_dxze43,Do you have any thoughts to share about the girl with red eyes? I'm excited to know what you think :),t3_dxze43
f7xua6c,t3_dxze43,woah i love the story! she kinda reminds me of eri from bnha.,t3_dxze43
f7xqw7t,t3_dxze43,Is it weird.. I've always wanted red eyes....,t3_dxze43
f7yanq1,t3_dxze43,"Wait, that's not scary! I'm still waiting for someone to finally bite me and give me cool powers (probably)!",t3_dxze43
f7zb6vi,t3_dxze43,No,t3_dxze43
f7xp3aa,t1_f7xonkr,"Thanks, darkytae, I appreciate it :) I'm trying to improve.",t3_dxze43
f7xkug2,t1_f7xi87h,"Honestly... the twist kinda ruins the high point of the mystery/horror, which is the kids all saying the same thing in unison, over and over. Why didn't they just explain? I can see how this could be a Sinister Faction A vs Sinister Faction B type of situation (and thus none of the intruding ""civilian's"" business), but it ought to be made clearer, and, at any rate, it's already getting a little too convoluted.

Which is a pity because you were going very strong in the first half.",t3_dxze43
f7z83ps,t1_f7xi87h,"I think on u If you put a twist weâ€™re you said your not like us are you , because you would be an alien",t3_dxze43
f80ro1t,t1_f7xua6c,You're too kind :) And I can see the resemblance.,t3_dxze43
f7xpcbo,t1_f7xkug2,"I won't expand much, else I feel it ruins the chance for other readers to draw their own conclusions and interpretations. I will say if something doesn't seem entirely clear, that's by design. I understand the want for clearer answers. But considering the word limit, only so much can be explained while still giving an interesting narrative. The balance isn't always ideal, but we writers try our best. Thanks for reading.",t3_dxze43

f7xsfob,t1_f7xpcbo,"Um, I'm kind of a writer myself. It's not the lack of clear answers, per se. It's the strong impression of prioritizing genre expectations over a cohesive premise, and trying to fit as many thrills as possible into those 500 words (or rather, the final 200 or so).",t3_dxze43
f80rkwf,t1_f7xqxar,">We can't know anything more than the narrator knows when it's first person narrative.

That's a very good point, phoenixfeather. I sometimes forget that whenever I read other stories lol I'm glad you enjoyed reading this :)",t3_dxze43
