fc9gkqe,t3_egqufn,"This is amazing. At 27 I still fear going up (or down) the stairs at night, so I was on edge waiting for the monster to catch up with her. Loved the alternative twist!",t3_egqufn
fc8ztyy,t3_egqufn,"Damn stairs, knowing that Abigail's parents aren't home, she invited man into the house. Stairnager this day has no discipline. (This is a really stupid joke)

Teenager-Stairnager aside, cool one. As a child, a lot of us fear going up the stair, scared that something lurking in the darkness is going to pull you down into the shadow, but holy hell that twist appear out of nowhere, just like the man himself. Thank you for making me fear stairs again! Nice story.",t3_egqufn
fc9rfha,t3_egqufn,Turns out her parents hired someone to do repairs in the upstairs bathroom and forgot to let their daughter know,t3_egqufn
fc98plp,t3_egqufn,This is really good!,t3_egqufn
fca2eiv,t3_egqufn,"I really liked it! It made me be thankful once again for living in a house without stairs. 
Then again, it also reminded me why I sleep with the lights on.",t3_egqufn
fca99oy,t3_egqufn,"I feel like I can give a lot of critism but honestly I just liked it. 

Here, take a upvote.

*don't you dare to close your eyes*",t3_egqufn
fcanfmy,t3_egqufn,"I think it should read ""the unfamiliar man who stood"" or maybe ""the unfamiliar man standing"".

Excellent job. So simple, so small, but so creepy.",t3_egqufn
fc9edcd,t3_egqufn,This is good!,t3_egqufn
fcabpsj,t3_egqufn,"This was really good, I loved the twist! It's not often it genuinely catches me by surprise like that.

My only criticism would be to try and make the language a little more modern, it read almost like a fairy tale which doesn't fit with the story itself.

Definitely gonna look out for your future works though!",t3_egqufn
fc9xbtp,t3_egqufn,"This twist! I was expecting it to be one of those ones that builds the suspense then ends harmlessly, but NO",t3_egqufn
fcbc0m9,t3_egqufn,This had,t3_egqufn
fcbc5s8,t3_egqufn,Me scared!!,t3_egqufn
fcct84z,t3_egqufn,"These were the exact feeling I had when I had to go up the dark stairs into my not yet lit bedroom when I was a kid.

I still have those feelings from time to time as a grown up now...",t3_egqufn
fcd1ecy,t3_egqufn,"THAT was damn good twist. I really felt the terror after thinking our girl had reached safety only to be in even more danger. 
Honestly, that monster is more terrifying than anything I could've dreamt ðŸ˜°",t3_egqufn
fciqo47,t3_egqufn,"I just read your other story after reading this one. I personally think this one is alot better. The other story was good, don't get me wrong, but I didn't understand why Chloe reacted the way she did if john was in danger. This story though flowed very well and the twist and how ""humans are the real monsters"" is something I really like in my horror. Good job! Very well done.(I did Keep thinking just turn on a dang light lol but I mean I get you got to let some things go for plot. So thats not a true complaint I maybe would've had the power be cut or something but its not fundamental to the story so I'll shut up now lol) Keep up the good work!
Edit: some punctuation and mistypes.",t3_egqufn
fcbojp3,t3_egqufn,This is the perfect length and also really spooky. I know I've had those silly feelings of fear when going upstairs at night and this just... freaks me out (in a good way),t3_egqufn
fccla9w,t3_egqufn,As someone who still hates being home alone as an adult this really got to me. Good job!,t3_egqufn
fcd6zr2,t3_egqufn,The last sentenced truly nailed it. Good thrill it was....,t3_egqufn
fc9koc9,t3_egqufn,"Good one, maybe you could also tried on something like sleep paralysis/lucid dreaming thing into this context instead of all that imagination.",t3_egqufn
fcaph04,t1_fc8rnl4,Loved this one!,t3_egqufn
fc9edbq,t1_fc9dck1,"Thank you for the feedback, I appreciate it!

My other story is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dusq73/night_calls/). I contemplated making a separate account just for stories but decided against it. Never mind.",t3_egqufn
fc9ihkq,t1_fc9gkqe,Thanks so much!,t3_egqufn
fc90jc5,t1_fc8ztyy,"You're ever so welcome for my revitalising your fear!

And thank you, too!",t3_egqufn
fc9b7md,t1_fc98plp,"Thank you, glad you enjoyed it!",t3_egqufn
fc9et9y,t1_fc9edcd,Thank you!,t3_egqufn
fcaogbc,t1_fc9edbq,Oh golly I remember reading that! Keep it up!,t3_egqufn
fcdm3ih,t1_fc9edbq,hey I remember this! one of my favorites,t3_egqufn
fcir0g1,t1_fc9ihkq,I'm 38 and still have that fear. I think it's something that doesn't go away with age. If it scares you after the age of like 10 it probably always will.,t3_egqufn
