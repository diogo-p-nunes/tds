fbkrv5j,t3_edsuq3,"So if I had a dream where I won a million dollar, did I just woke up back to eating instant noodle when my alternate self is enjoying proper food?


I don't fully understand this story, so can't really write critism or a witty comment :P. But I like the writing style, and the idea of ""every dreams that you have is actually an alternate reality""!",t3_edsuq3
fbksm8v,t1_fbkrv5j,"It's like a way of saying, that Everytime you wake up from a dream, you've woken up to another dream just like a dream within a dream. Thank you by the way, I tried to relate this story to my knowledge of quantum mechanics",t3_edsuq3
fbkteyx,t1_fbksm8v,"Ah, that's cool! I like stories about dream, so having an infinite loop of dreams is terrifying! Let's hope that I'm not dreaming right now.

I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I'm sure you're knowledgable on it! Keep on writing!",t3_edsuq3
fbkuqw0,t1_fbkteyx,"Maybe you are dreaming, somewhere, you're living this dream of your own from another parallel universe, it's always interesting to know that there are infinite possibilities to every event, in a parallel universe of reality, you'd probably just laugh at this story or maybe just research even further. Keep coming back to my stories, you'll learn quite some more. Thank you tho :)))",t3_edsuq3
