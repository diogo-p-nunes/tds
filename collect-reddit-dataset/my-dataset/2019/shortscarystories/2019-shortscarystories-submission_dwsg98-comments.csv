f7nb1dv,t3_dwsg98,"I like to hear about not so cookie cutter immortals, namely ones who can't remember quite all the details of their exsistence. Memory being a fleeting thing. I'm tired of the cliches that have lived through and experienced all measures of important points in history, and are as mentally fresh as dasies and sickeningly blissful about their ongoing life. (can you tell I'm just a little jaded? lol)

Mucho kudos to your story though. I felt it. Reminded me of the movie ""He Never Died"". ❣️",t3_dwsg98
f7myqzy,t3_dwsg98,Wow!! Great story! The twist at the end is chilling.,t3_dwsg98
f7n6zd0,t3_dwsg98,How is this not one of the stories that gets hundreds of upvotes I love how this is written it's better than most stories I see in this sub imo,t3_dwsg98
f7nd1o4,t3_dwsg98,"The people working the surface are susceptible to cancer, are they not immortal?",t3_dwsg98
f7ladjw,t3_dwsg98,Spooky!  I liked it.,t3_dwsg98
f7qxmpv,t3_dwsg98,"Just go bodily disintegration, friend. Worst case, you're still alive and aware, but now as a collection of loosely bound atoms. That means superpowers!",t3_dwsg98

f7nbp0q,t1_f7nb1dv,"Thank you ! Never saw the movie (no spoiler), but yeah, I wanted to explore what a real immortal could be like : fuzzy memories, bones broken ten times and thus fragile, habits deeply engrained, no sense of urgency...",t3_dwsg98
f85r92v,t1_f7n6zd0,I greatly agree,t3_dwsg98
f7ou088,t1_f7nd1o4,You can imagine immortality in many ways. Simply losing the ability to die can make sickness an unending suffering rather than one that stops with death.,t3_dwsg98
f7toewl,t1_f7ou088,I think the same way too!,t3_dwsg98
