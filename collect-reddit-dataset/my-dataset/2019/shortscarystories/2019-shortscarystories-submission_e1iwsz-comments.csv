f8tjnhi,t3_e1iwsz,"I love the first paragraph and the way you said they died, it felt natural and it was a unique way of playing it, the way you introduced the character through stages of their life so we get to know them but it doesn't feel rushed or too slow. This is well written and spooky. This is a great story!",t3_e1iwsz
