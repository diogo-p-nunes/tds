fbfoyoa,t3_ed4z3i,"That is why I made my handwriting terrible. Just in case someone fake my suicide note, and not because I can't stabilize my hand.

Handwriting asides, great story. You can feel the sense of despair as if you were the one from beyond, trying so hard to tell your loved one to be careful, but someone else is giving a different message. 

Dunno why people still believe in psychic or mediums. Have they never see Sixth Sense? Seeing dead people everyday is tiring probably.",t3_ed4z3i
fbgaqd5,t3_ed4z3i,This story reminds me of Harry Houdini.  He spent a lot of time exposing fake mediums.  But he was always hoping to find a real medium so he could talk to his deceased mother one more time.  He never did find a real one.,t3_ed4z3i
