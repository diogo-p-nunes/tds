fc4x64v,t3_eg7szm,Why is this not voted on? Good shit my dude. Really loved it.,t3_eg7szm
fc58wb3,t3_eg7szm,"if i may suggest, try not to give the suspense in the title itself. otherwise, great story, loved it.",t3_eg7szm
fc5s0ue,t3_eg7szm,"Before seeing the subreddit and reading the story.. my first thought was ""throw something at it"". I still stand by that. Lol",t3_eg7szm
fc53cnk,t3_eg7szm,Oooo.. the end gave me the chills!,t3_eg7szm
fc79am8,t3_eg7szm,"Loved it! Very well done. Some people have pointed out this is a common trope, which I don't feel is a problem in a strong, well-written story like yours. Keep writing, you are so talented!",t3_eg7szm
fc522mt,t3_eg7szm,Great twist in the end. Scary ðŸ˜±,t3_eg7szm
fc5974i,t3_eg7szm,"Hit it!

<frantic lady screaming noises as the camera lifts above the room, above the house and unto the heavens>

Well written. I could experience each moment of it all.

Upvoted!",t3_eg7szm
fc87b7n,t3_eg7szm,Creep.... I swear I won't sleep ever again in that room....,t3_eg7szm
fc6iyl1,t3_eg7szm,"Wow, really spooky!",t3_eg7szm
fc6os7c,t3_eg7szm,OMG. That really was a good one! Made me jump. Yikes!!!,t3_eg7szm
fc6ov1v,t3_eg7szm,Part two please,t3_eg7szm
fcmawas,t3_eg7szm,"Oh gosh, now I'm terrified to go to sleep because my husband snores :C

Also, could I narrate this for you? I'll link it back here and credit you of course!",t3_eg7szm
fed1i1w,t3_eg7szm,"Why would you spend all your money on a house? If you can't afford to furnish the house, then you can't afford the house. Make better decisions.",t3_eg7szm
fc5e6sg,t3_eg7szm,That final line is *chef's kiss*!!!,t3_eg7szm
fc562fm,t3_eg7szm,super overdone story,t3_eg7szm
fc5msls,t3_eg7szm,"I posted something similar on r/twosentencehorror 

Is this an extended, ""inspired from"" version?

fc5swxp,t1_fc4x64v,"Because the ""thought it was my dog/husband but I suddenly remember that it/he was dead/gone and really is a monster"" trope has been done to death",t3_eg7szm
fc5xnvr,t1_fc58wb3,"Thank you for the feedback! I tend to agree, but I couldnâ€™t come up with a better title for this one than the first sentence.",t3_eg7szm
fc5xym3,t1_fc5s0ue,"In real life, I probably would. I almost did when I first heard it (this was inspired by a real life sound distortion room). Not sure itll help this helpless horror victim though XD",t3_eg7szm
fcmczny,t1_fcmawas,"It terrifies me too! Iâ€™m happy to allow anyone to narrate but I did already grant one narrator permission, so it just depends on if you mind doubling.",t3_eg7szm
fc5t1b7,t1_fc562fm,Seriously this trope is all over r/twosentencehorror too,t3_eg7szm
fc5y32x,t1_fc562fm,Thank you for the feedback! I tend to subscribe to the â€˜every story has already been toldâ€™ idea in my writing. I realize this is probably not my most original concept though.,t3_eg7szm
fc5i10w,t1_fc562fm,Nah.,t3_eg7szm
fc5tiw5,t1_fc5msls,"No, I think this sort of story is just extremely overdone.",t3_eg7szm
fc5x61p,t1_fc5msls,"Ooo yours gave me chills! But no, I think itâ€™s just a common story type. I was inspired from a room Iâ€™m staying in this week that sends most sound to the opposite corner. It freaked me out when I first heard it and I wanted to write something.",t3_eg7szm
fc5xrj7,t1_fc5swxp,"Thank you for the feedback! I agree, this one is a bit trope-y.",t3_eg7szm
fcjfa6v,t1_fc5swxp,then who was phone,t3_eg7szm
fckriaz,t1_fc5xnvr,I actually disagree. That's what made me click on the story!,t3_eg7szm
fcmdjcb,t1_fcmczny,I don't mind doubling at all! I love listening to others takes on it :) Get this to you ASAP!,t3_eg7szm
fc5u97e,t1_fc5t1b7,"Oh, not just there but from the last century quite a few short horrors have the same plot, and hundreds of thousands of variations (who was alone that day, how the build up is implemented) have been put online. Nosleep is littered with it, and that leaks through to this sub and two sentence horror as well",t3_eg7szm
fc5tnhx,t1_fc5tiw5,That is plausible.,t3_eg7szm
fc8oxij,t1_fc5x61p,"i understand, cheers for being a sport.",t3_eg7szm
fc5yk5c,t1_fc5xrj7,"It might be tropes, but it's done well. And thats all I ask for really. Not everytime can it be a pure crisp idea. In fact every story is really just a remix of another. Don't not write something cause it's it's tropey hell it still gave me pause and I had to check on my bf, who doesn't even snore!",t3_eg7szm
fcmzddw,t1_fcjfa6v,"I think you mean ""who was corner""",t3_eg7szm
fcmzbxm,t1_fckriaz,"Ditto.  You'll be surprised how much of time the title reels you in even if it gives a hint into the story.  Not everyone is looking for a twist, some just like the premise and the flow",t3_eg7szm
fcmixg5,t1_fcmdjcb,Very cool! :),t3_eg7szm
fc5uupy,t1_fc5tnhx,"More than plausible. Like OP, you seem to think your idea is more original than it really is.",t3_eg7szm
fcpag0c,t1_fcmzbxm,Exactly! Like I was wondering what what snoring!,t3_eg7szm
fc5xcx6,t1_fc5uupy,"*shrug* I subscribe to the â€˜every story has already been toldâ€™ theory, tbh. I wasnâ€™t aiming for original, just scary. But thank you for the feedback.",t3_eg7szm
fcv8mrq,t1_fcpag0c,Now it's awake.  That right there will have anyone terrified,t3_eg7szm
fcweyp2,t1_fcv8mrq,See to me the story could go multiple ways after that,t3_eg7szm
fcxllvo,t1_fcweyp2,Exactly.  That what makes for entertainment,t3_eg7szm
