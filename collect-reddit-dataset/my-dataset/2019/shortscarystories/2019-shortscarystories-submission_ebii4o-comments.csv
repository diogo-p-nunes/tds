 Tremblingâ€¦I was jarred awake by my own trembling. Now I lay here and realize my ill fate. I am growing shorter of breath with every passing second. As my eyes adjust to the absolute darkness I am able to see the surroundings that shall be my final resting place. I feel around frantically, trying, hoping for a flaw in the wood. The trepidation is surrounding me tighter than the shroud I find myself in. As I search for some frailty in the box, my worry turns to ferocity at the events that led to my ultimate demise. I scream, letting my rage flow through my teeth, with such a violence I thought I might burst through this thin coffin and back into the world. Although all is for not, for I have been doomed to spend my last moments with no hope and no ear to hear my cries. Now I am down to my last breaths, and even in this eternal black, it seems a darker form is enclosing me. The last of my thoughts of this world send a final chill down my spine, as I witness the fire that awaits me beyond.",t3_ebii4o
