f8218nm,t3_dyj1ms,"Plot twist:  What if he‚Äôs smelling himself...
The smell always gets stronger when something is about to happen ‚Äî like him killing them.",t3_dyj1ms

f81p5z7,t3_dyj1ms,I want to know what the priest was gonna do!!!,t3_dyj1ms
f81ru6w,t3_dyj1ms,"This is good, have you ever watched In Bruges?
 It reminded me of it cuz a priest was shot through a confession booth",t3_dyj1ms
f81kve9,t3_dyj1ms,"holy shit, a bit complicated but thats really cool!",t3_dyj1ms
f81msam,t3_dyj1ms,Wow! Not the twist I was expecting!,t3_dyj1ms
f83asq5,t3_dyj1ms,"Just for reference, the Roman Catholic Sacrament of confession follows a sort of script. In America (where I am) it usually goes like this. First, the penitent enters the confessional, kneels and makes sign of the cross aloud, then says:

""Bless me, Father for I have sinned. It has been [*days/weeks/months/years*] since my last confession. In that time I've (list the sins and approx number of times committed)""

(Then the priest says his parts, but I don't have that memorized.)",t3_dyj1ms
f81moay,t3_dyj1ms,Very cool concept.,t3_dyj1ms
f81y8m9,t3_dyj1ms,"This is such a cool concept. I love the way you wrote it too, without giving too much away. Love it!!",t3_dyj1ms
f82h9qi,t3_dyj1ms,Sounds like the plot of frailty to me. Good story though.,t3_dyj1ms
f82ha72,t3_dyj1ms,I need this fully fleshed put üòç if anyone knows of a story like this I‚Äôd be up for reading it.,t3_dyj1ms
f81pp70,t3_dyj1ms,Reminded me of Exorcist III,t3_dyj1ms
f81veo8,t3_dyj1ms,"Very good. Reminds me of Stephen King,",t3_dyj1ms
f82991r,t3_dyj1ms,Ofcourse the priest would smell.. They all do .. :D great story!,t3_dyj1ms
f83bgsl,t3_dyj1ms,I would love to see this developed into a movie or show - maybe that protagonist starts trying to save the people from themselves instead of killing them?,t3_dyj1ms
f83c32w,t3_dyj1ms,This sounds like the openeing sense to a movie... i dig it!!,t3_dyj1ms
f83fcso,t3_dyj1ms,I really like this concept. I like the mystery behind the narrators actions and how it could be him smelling himself.,t3_dyj1ms
f83hgmu,t3_dyj1ms,"Ok.. So what if the smell came from him and unconsciously the people around him starts picking it up.. And it was HIS smell that made them do the crime.. Like  a drug, changing their behavior..",t3_dyj1ms
f845g02,t3_dyj1ms,I really liked this.,t3_dyj1ms
f88urab,t3_dyj1ms,"It's like a one-man Minority Report, I love it!",t3_dyj1ms
f89vwae,t3_dyj1ms,Ooh really good. Would you mind if I narrate it for a video tomorrow?,t3_dyj1ms
fb5iic0,t3_dyj1ms,maybe hes farting with tension.,t3_dyj1ms
f81sr6k,t3_dyj1ms,"Yooooooooooooooo this would be such a cool movie üò± I love how it was written, such a good read",t3_dyj1ms
f8293bw,t1_f8218nm,"Ooh, I like this idea! Awesome interpretation of a very cool story!",t3_dyj1ms
f8328xb,t1_f8218nm,Nice.,t3_dyj1ms
f83che5,t1_f8218nm,"His kind neighbor did things to children and his dad beat his mom after the smell.  It also doesn‚Äôt say he killed those people, when the cops got his neighbor he probably didn‚Äôt do anything to them. 

Doesn‚Äôt check out enough for me, but nice thought",t3_dyj1ms
f88oqed,t1_f8218nm,"whoever smelt it, dealt it",t3_dyj1ms
fb00pqu,t1_f8218nm,Well got dam,t3_dyj1ms
fbbuklx,t1_f8218nm,"I thought the same. Over time, he became the stink.",t3_dyj1ms
fhr6aks,t1_f8218nm,"That's what I was thinking. Maybe at one point he was able to recognize the ones who were rotten, but once he started killing, he started to ""rot"" himself.",t3_dyj1ms
f81qgd6,t1_f81p1s1,"Yeah, if there was a reference to the ""smell"" in the ending, it would complete the arc as it started.",t3_dyj1ms
f8321su,t1_f81p1s1,Is that what that was? Gunshots aren't muffled pops.,t3_dyj1ms

f81zujq,t1_f81ru6w,"That movie is a fucking masterpiece and so few people have seen it, it pains me.",t3_dyj1ms
f81ulf9,t1_f81ru6w,Yes,t3_dyj1ms
f8322am,t1_f81ru6w,"Hell yeah I did. Didn't cross my mind, but now that you mention it...",t3_dyj1ms

f826yqw,t1_f81sr6k,You should watch Dexter.,t3_dyj1ms
f8hhlla,t1_f8328xb,69  upvotes Nice.,t3_dyj1ms
f84ee8a,t1_f83che5,"I think they meant that as of late, he himself has begun to smell and he assumed it was someone else. Like for example he has the power but now he cant tell who it is who smells",t3_dyj1ms

f93mnkq,t1_f8321su,"Ever heard of a silencer? I mean, our main character doesn't seem like an idiot or like hes out to get caught. If you're gonna shoot someone in a church in broad daylight, I'd bring a silencer.",t3_dyj1ms

f827w0a,t1_f81zujq,What is it about?,t3_dyj1ms
f8e7cll,t1_f8a0vbs,Video's up. Hope you like it. I was sick so my voice isn't the best. https://youtu.be/EtuAkXTQPSk,t3_dyj1ms
f83jp16,t1_f826yqw,Ooooooo thanks for the suggestion,t3_dyj1ms
f8326dm,t1_f81qluz,">You were very close to me. Close enough to tell. 

I meant for this line to work that way - maybe I could have phrased it another way.",t3_dyj1ms
f82uyyq,t1_f81qluz,I like the idea of him asking the priest if he smelled anything.,t3_dyj1ms

f82bp9c,t1_f827w0a,"It's about a hitman who botches his first job and he and his partner are sent to Bruges to wait for their next orders from the boss. It's a really simplistic setup, but the meat of the movie is that the main character is really troubled by things he's done as a hitman, and it gets really emotionally heavy with lots of philosophical stuff about morality, but it's very well complimented by a lot of dark humor and general hijinks the characters get up to trying to fill their time. And the dialogue is hands down the best in any movie I've ever seen. It feels extremely natural, but there's almost no throwaway lines either. 

I highly recommend that you don't watch any trailer for the movie. The official trailers make it look like some shitty buddy cop comedy romp and spoil a couple of MAJOR plot points, and the fan-made ones always seem to give away too much of overall story. Just know if you're a fan of moral philosophical stuff and dark humor, you'll probably very thoroughly enjoy the movie.",t3_dyj1ms
f83gyvc,t1_f8326dm,If you just changed it to ‚ÄúClose enough to smell‚Äù I think the whole thing would come togethwr,t3_dyj1ms
f88u4s1,t1_f8326dm,"Maybe ""Close enough to get a whiff""?",t3_dyj1ms
f82i395,t1_f81xrav,And use the carpool lane when they drive alone,t3_dyj1ms
f82j3rd,t1_f82bp9c,"I agree, the movie is amazing, one of my favorites. I watched the trailer first and didn‚Äôt really want to watch it because it just looked like an offensive comedy or something, but then I watched it and was like wtf that was nothing like what I thought it‚Äôd be. It‚Äôs cinematography is excellent, the way almost every line is referenced later or a foreshadowment, it‚Äôs exploration ito morality, etc. it‚Äôs awesome",t3_dyj1ms
f82ktoz,t1_f82j3rd,"Yeah, the trailers made it look like a really generic like action comedy or something, and I had zero interest in it until a coworker recommended it to me and it was not at all what I was expecting. The whole movie is a beautiful, somber spectacle but the dialogue is my favorite part. Nearly every conversation has some relevance to things that happen later in the plot, but not a single line of it feels awkward or out of place, or even comes across as foreshadowing. It's all perfectly natural sounding, but it turns out to be this amazing complex tapestry as the film progresses. Even the random lines that seem like random throwaway lines for comic relief are relevant to the narrative. I've never experienced anything else like it. And to have all that wrapped up in a story that so interestingly and poignantly explores morality and the value of a life is just so perfect. I can't recommend that movie enough.",t3_dyj1ms
