fc71k05,t3_egjk9t,"I knew History channel is right, aliens does exist! Now time to ask them how they build the Pyramid.

Nonsensical History channel aside, cool alien story. The ""looking like ""Greys"""" line and the narrator having no trouble speaking to the alien is a nice hint towards the twist. The idea is wonderful and terrifying too. Good one.

If aliens could disguise themselves as human, and learn about our mind and how we worked, I wonder how awesome their short scary stories would be.",t3_egjk9t
