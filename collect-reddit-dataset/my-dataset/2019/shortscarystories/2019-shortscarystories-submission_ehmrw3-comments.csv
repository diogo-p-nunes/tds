fck9zay,t3_ehmrw3,"That k-word, while meaning “non-believer”, has more than one meaning (perhaps you may know already, I’m just writing it anyway in case others may not). The k-term is also used as a racial slur against persons of African/Black descent (equivalent of the n-word). 

I think you may want to re-examine the use of this word because it may cause your story be misconstrued/misunderstood as the person carrying out a targeted attack specifically against the above mentioned ethnic group. I do not think this was your intention. 

The concept behind the story doesn’t seem overly scary but concerning, especially considering the increase in attacks against religious & other minority groups recently. 

I understand that as writers, particularly horror writers, we push the envelope. We have to. But timing and social context play a role too. As artists, we have the unique honour of examining and critiquing society through a creative lens. We make people think twice about human nature, our assumptions about “good & evil”, and the unknown, among many other things. 

For example, what if the story was about an American politician blowing themselves up after a speech?  Or what if it were about a banker or successful businessman doing same? An innocent looking cheerleader, a teacher, or Girl Scout? Here we have an effect that is less stereotypical and far more unexpected. This gives you a lot of room to play with tension and dread too, which will make your work even scarier. 

Keep letting your creativity flow. I wish you the best of luck on your next piece and hope you will post again.",t3_ehmrw3
