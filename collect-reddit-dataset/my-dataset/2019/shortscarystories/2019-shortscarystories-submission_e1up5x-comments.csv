f8rvrgn,t3_e1up5x,That's a scary premise. Good job.,t3_e1up5x
f8sf5qq,t3_e1up5x,"Very difficult to read, constantly changing verb tenses and wall of text.  Suggest proper spacing and verb tense review.

However, the plot and twist are far from original...maybe try something more unexpected or fresh?",t3_e1up5x

f8tssl7,t1_f8sf5qq,"Sorry, I wrote this in 20 minutes. I'm not the best at vocabulary. This is my original idea, I never heard of another story of a grandma breaking in your house and killing you as she did to your sister but your dad saved you kind of story before. Plz, send a link to another story just like this. Thank you for your feedback.",t3_e1up5x
