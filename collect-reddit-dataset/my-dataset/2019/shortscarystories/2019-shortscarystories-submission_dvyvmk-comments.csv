f7frebl,t3_dvyvmk,"This is an alright story but the word choice of zooming was so hilarious it totally took me out of the mood for horror tales haha. I’ve never seen someone use it on here before, we say it all the time",t3_dvyvmk
f7g2q58,t3_dvyvmk,Way to crush those dreams fun-suckers,t3_dvyvmk
f7gsu5a,t3_dvyvmk,There's not even lions in this story. Shame shame.,t3_dvyvmk
f7hcbg2,t3_dvyvmk,"I like the premise, but the delivery took me out of it.  The inconsistency of a burglar to their bodies is showing a lot or is this part of the plot.  I love the final sentence, but I feel more thought should have been put into it.  Or I might be wrong, that's just me",t3_dvyvmk
f7gh08a,t1_f7frebl,"I see your point,  but I think they may have aslo meant to do that because they were amused at the fact the dude broke in as well. So, it kinda added to the story for me.",t3_dvyvmk
f7fxkyl,t1_f7frebl,"I totally agree. The descriptive language used was great, however a few words (like your example of zoomed) almost seemed comical and ruined the mood a little. Well done to op though. I understand how hard it is to write with a word limit so low.",t3_dvyvmk
f7hb14w,t1_f7gh08a,"I don’t think it’s strictly a negative, but I wanted to point it out",t3_dvyvmk
