f7kn4o2,t3_dwe8dj,Very nicely written. I like your style,t3_dwe8dj
f7rrc7t,t3_dwe8dj,"I think this was missing the punchline “revelation” or macabre elements that make most stories here popular.  It’s not really scary, I guess?

But the writing was very good. I was pleasantly surprised by that to the extent that it gave an overdone premise (incel makes his bed and lies in it) a breath of character that made it feel unique to me.

Cool story. I would try to be mindful about how scary it is if that’s what you’re aiming for, but the talent for writing is absolutely there.",t3_dwe8dj

f7t7p82,t1_f7rrc7t,"Thanks fo the thoughtful reply. Yeah, it doesn't have that classic punch at the end, but I felt the overall implication was pretty terrifying once considered. Glad you liked the writing and hope scare you with the next one.",t3_dwe8dj
