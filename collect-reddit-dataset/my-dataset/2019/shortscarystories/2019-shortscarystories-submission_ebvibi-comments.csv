fb7mo1r,t3_ebvibi,I like how much this leaves to the imagination,t3_ebvibi
fb7oje1,t3_ebvibi,"Really nicely done. In a time when so much horror fiction is so far over the top that it backfires, it's refreshing to read a piece that conveys subtle dread.",t3_ebvibi
fb7sq0h,t3_ebvibi,Loved this!! Really got an image in my mind of that scary wall dweller,t3_ebvibi

fb7rcvc,t3_ebvibi,"Gave me the good spoops, it reminds me of a childhood fear of a friend of mine!",t3_ebvibi
fb82wbl,t3_ebvibi,"Nope nope nope nope nope, I have goosebumps now",t3_ebvibi
fb8c3lz,t3_ebvibi,Literally the life of the rat living in my wall,t3_ebvibi
fb8dvd3,t3_ebvibi,"It's probably that one crazy dude trying to kill his ex and her daughter in another story in this subreddit.

Vague reference aside, spooky. Like your other story about the monster with the corkscrew leg, the story itself gives out the feeling of fear of the unknown, and how the wall that you're leaning on, might just have something waiting to get you on the other side of it.",t3_ebvibi
fb83i0f,t3_ebvibi,"I kinda use the upvote as a 'save' button

fb9wjo7,t3_ebvibi,I sing this to your son every night.,t3_ebvibi
fb9xuva,t3_ebvibi,"This reads to me less like an honest warning and more like a veiled threat to keep someone quiet... Yikes. Great job, OP.",t3_ebvibi
fb7mosc,t1_fb7mo1r,Thank you for liking it!,t3_ebvibi
fb9x2a5,t1_fb7mo1r,"Yeah, my mind totally runs away with this one. So many clues to suggest one interpretation or another. Gaslighting a crazy person? A sane person? Crazed maniac who really believes it? Are they working together and he’s getting her up to speed... which means this thing is real?

Amazing work! Please keep it up",t3_ebvibi

fb9f9za,t1_fb9bq61,Thanks!,t3_ebvibi
fb8k5kp,t1_fb8jso7,She was always afraid that a creature might live in her walls that would come out at night to watch her sleep. She always hid under the blanket so the creature wouldn't see her. In her sleep paralysis she usually saw a really skinny shadow creature slid down from the ceiling and disappeared back into the wall after lurking around her bed for a while.,t3_ebvibi
fb8fr69,t1_fb8epis,"Don't know about that. I'd rather met the Wallmate than seeing my mother after I miss her call 4 times.
