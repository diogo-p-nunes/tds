f9jc5hu,t3_e5bgva,"I was with you until the thing tried to pick *you* up in *your* car and have you *pay* for it? The balls on this ghost, dumb bitch. I would have fuckin punched the living daylights out of it, this little shit thinks it can make me *pay* for my *own* fuckn car",t3_e5bgva
f9jbres,t3_e5bgva,Well damn. So basically the thing stole her car and tried to use Uber. The disrespect. No but damn great twist at the end.,t3_e5bgva
f9ivc6c,t3_e5bgva,good story,t3_e5bgva
f9j6e13,t3_e5bgva,did not expect that,t3_e5bgva
f9jee0i,t3_e5bgva,"This is the first time I remember where I actually like the longer version you posted on NoSleep better! 

I think the thing in your car is a doppelganger that wants to eat you, so it can take your form.",t3_e5bgva
f9jfabs,t3_e5bgva,"scariest part pf the story was that you were gonna drive home despite being ""more than a little buzzed""",t3_e5bgva
f9jt2l3,t3_e5bgva,Big head Severus Snape is in your back seat fam.,t3_e5bgva
f9k38z7,t3_e5bgva,Note to self: Never be last one to leave club.,t3_e5bgva
f9jhpx5,t3_e5bgva,"Really loved the way you described things, it gave me a great feel for the protagonist and situation. That twist was killer also.",t3_e5bgva
f9k5tpp,t3_e5bgva,"Possibly unrelated, but is that special  you described (shot of whiskey and beer for $5,) commonplace all across America? For some reason I thought it was just a Philly/east coast thing.

PS. Love this line: ""If you got a dollar for every beard, glasses, and plaid combo you saw, you’d walk out of there with enough money to hit one of the classier joints in town. """,t3_e5bgva

f9k0woy,t3_e5bgva,it won't get out and fight me tho.,t3_e5bgva
f9jjxfz,t3_e5bgva,"Wow, this is great.",t3_e5bgva
f9kbov5,t3_e5bgva,Jack White?,t3_e5bgva
f9kk0yq,t3_e5bgva,"Very nice story, nice writing style, I love it. One of the best I've read here.",t3_e5bgva
f9ku3t5,t3_e5bgva,"Thank you, thank you for the chills! This is the kind of stories I like the most. 
Now I'm looking for the longer version, has it got the same title?",t3_e5bgva
f9m4acq,t3_e5bgva,I pictured momo a bit,t3_e5bgva
f9u13om,t3_e5bgva,"Just my personal opinion but I didn't like the last bit. It felt like an overkill of sorts. If the driver just never arrived or something, it'd be alright, but the thing being the Uber driver and trying to pick the narrator up in their own car is just an overkill, mate.",t3_e5bgva
f9jj0mm,t1_f9jc5hu,We got a gangster over here!,t3_e5bgva
f9kasal,t1_f9jc5hu,"Your comment took me from creeped out to dying from laughter in a second. I enjoyed this as much as the story, thank you.",t3_e5bgva
f9kd9z8,t1_f9jc5hu,let's show him who's scarier. fckin scammer,t3_e5bgva
f9kdukb,t1_f9jc5hu,"We need more people like you in comments sections, to save the rest of us scaredy cats!",t3_e5bgva
f9k849f,t1_f9ivc6c,Thank you,t3_e5bgva
f9jkuji,t1_f9jee0i,"Yeah, I didn't like some of the details I had to lose in this shorter format. I like this ending better!",t3_e5bgva
f9jkw4c,t1_f9jfabs,Wonder if the thing in the backseat was a warning or punishment of sorts?,t3_e5bgva
f9kdzat,t1_f9jt2l3,"He was never killed. He just assimilated into Muggle life, and failed horribly in the process.",t3_e5bgva
f9k863m,t1_f9jhpx5,Thank for that. Much appreciated.,t3_e5bgva
f9k824b,t1_f9k5tpp,"Maybe it started out there, but I'm in the midwest/south and it is definitely a thing over here. Maybe others can confirm. 

Thanks for the compliment, btw!",t3_e5bgva
f9kd41w,t1_f9k5tpp,It’s a hipster thing.,t3_e5bgva
f9kyha2,t1_f9ku3t5,"I thought of this while walking to my car the other night. It was a little ways away from me, at the bottom of a hill and when I clicked the unlock button and the lights came on I thought, *what if someone was sitting in the backseat.* 

Here is the link to the other version. It's only 300 pages longer.  I was able to sweat it down to 500 words for this subreddit and I lost some detail. I much prefer the ending in this subreddit though.

f9m6mx6,t1_f9jj0mm,"The best defense against the supernatural is a combination of willful obliviousness (everyone knows ghosts can't hurt you if you straight up refuse to believe they exist in the face of overwhelming proof) and extreme violence (no explanation needed)

For an example, see the tale of the ghostpuncher https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/577dkg/the_ghost_puncher/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=comments_view_all",t3_e5bgva
f9jukn4,t1_f9jkw4c,"hmm, I like that hook",t3_e5bgva
f9ke6hf,t1_f9kd41w,"I don't know if that's true, we call it a ""city wide,"" here in Philly and you usually see it in dingy dive bars. Or maybe it is, tf do I know.",t3_e5bgva
f9rpgsk,t1_f9kyha2,"In all honesty and maybe because I read the shorter version first, I think I prefer the short story, even the ending. I find it straight to the point with only the little extra bits that are necessary to make it very interesting. I also think you did a wonderfully great job at making it shorter, it did not only not lose a bit of information, but it made it even stronger and with more impact, kinda more engaging if you know what I mean. Great job!",t3_e5bgva
f9mhlsl,t1_f9m6mx6,I can’t read it. It’s all blurry. All I got out of that was a pull up bar I think.,t3_e5bgva
f9rc8sj,t1_f9m6mx6,This was freakin EPIC!!!  Lifting buddy is KING!!!,t3_e5bgva
f9mfnir,t1_f9ke6hf,Heard it on *A Prairie Home Companion* as a “beer and a bump.” I imagine that Norwegian bachelor farmers are about as far from hipsterism as you can get.,t3_e5bgva
f9knd2i,t1_f9ke6hf,Hipsters ruin everything,t3_e5bgva
