f94spje,t3_e3c4c8,"Fun Fact: Henrietta Lacks was a real woman, she was a black woman who was turned away from a few hospitals that could help her because of it. She had felt a bump on her cervix and got it checked out, and they took some samples without her knowing or without her permission and ran tests. Because of this, before she passed away at a young age, her and her family (actually still to this day) have no gotten any profit from the hospital or any science department themselves despite Henrietta being the woman that led to us having information as early as we did about cervical cancer. She’s one of the first people who were studied, but they never told her, so none of the Lacks family has gotten any proceeds. Feel free to fact check me, it’s been a while since I read “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” :)",t3_e3c4c8
