fae93uh,t3_e8oq65,Well done.,t3_e8oq65
faf8a6e,t3_e8oq65,I'm curious about who it was from. Great job!,t3_e8oq65
fafoj62,t3_e8oq65,"Ooh! This reminds me of a Chinese sci fi novel called The Three Body Problem. Really cool, I loved that book. I love this, too!",t3_e8oq65
fafa9vr,t1_faf8a6e,"I'm glad you asked. The message was from Gaennon (like Gaea), the Protector of Earth. There was a great battle between her and Persesix (like Perses), the Destroyer. Sadly, Persesix defeated Gaennon and in her dying efforts, she sent warning to her children on planet Earth. The original story contained all the background information but I decided to cut it all out to achieve a more abrupt ending. It felt super risky. I just hope it worked.",t3_e8oq65

""Captain, incoming transmission.""

Static...

""Gaennon, we have you surrounded. Surrender your ship immediately and I will spare your crew. Failure to comply will result in their deaths too.""

""Captain, orders?""

Gaennon searched for understanding. There was none to be had. The Persesians long felt Gaennon's children were a curse, their ever-expanding endeavors encroaching on the beyond. This time they had gone too far and Persesix, The Destroyer, sought to finally snuff them out. The only thing standing in his way was Gaennon and her sworn protectors.

""Dispatch a message. We must warn them. Then take the rest of the crew and rendezvous with the others. I will hold them off as long as I can,"" Gaennon ordered.

""Captain, are you coming?!""

""Lieutenant, get your women out of here!""

""Captain,"" she said solemnly, fist to chest.

Moments later...static...

""Persesix, you hector! I will not idly stand by! I will not watch you destroy her! You must know she will fight so I hope you are ready for the fight of your life! Damn you and your destroyers to obliv‚Äî""

fafhd3b,t1_fafa9vr,Thank you for explaining. Keep up the great work!,t3_e8oq65
fafpg2s,t1_fafpbam,"It's the beginning of quite an epic trilogy, spanning everything from the Cultural Revolution to hundreds of years into the future to -- yup, aliens.",t3_e8oq65
fafq514,t1_fafpg2s,"Oh wow. According to Wikipedia:

""Liu Cixin is a Chinese science fiction writer. He is a nine-time winner of the Galaxy Award, winner of the 2015 Hugo Award and the 2017 Locus Award as well as a nominee for the Nebula Award. In English translations of his works, his name is given in the form Cixin Liu.""
