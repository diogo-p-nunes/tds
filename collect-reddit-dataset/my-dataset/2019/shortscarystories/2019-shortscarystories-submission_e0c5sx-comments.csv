f8dmp31,t3_e0c5sx,"I cried at the ending. I read every word, waiting for something to happen to the parents. My parents were very similar to the parents in your story, and many times I would imagine taking a similar way out myself, to rid myself of my own misery and hurt them as much as they hurt me. 
Well told, well paced, and your capture of the mind of a child in this situation was perfect. Thanks for sharing this.",t3_e0c5sx
