fbg8cfd,t3_ed812d,"I've got no witty comment. Alice is pretty much a dickhead here.

Alice aside, horrifying. This seems to also tie in with missing children cases, and how they too are lured with the promise of safety and happiness, only to be taken to god knows where. Chilling story.",t3_ed812d
fbh1ksm,t3_ed812d,"See, now THIS is a good story.",t3_ed812d
fbhemtv,t3_ed812d,i love the story but am confused about the ending,t3_ed812d
fbhlihc,t3_ed812d,"Dont fall down the rabbit hole, Alice!",t3_ed812d
fbkgg1y,t3_ed812d,Ouch. Out of the frying pan and into the fire.,t3_ed812d
fbh6iww,t1_fbg8cfd,"Really? I thought she was somewhat okay. Like, she *does* feel remorse. But perhaps I'm biased. And yeah! I was kind of playing into that ""run away kid gets kidnapping"" thing. Thank you for reading. :)",t3_ed812d
fbh6jka,t1_fbh1ksm,Thank you! :D,t3_ed812d
fbhizn1,t1_fbhemtv,glad iâ€™m not the only one,t3_ed812d
fbhm3uc,t1_fbhemtv,The giant turns a corner and the kid loses sight of the cabin. But perhaps I could've clarified it better / worded it different. I'll keep clarity in mind for future stories.,t3_ed812d
fbhm25a,t1_fbhlihc,Haha. :),t3_ed812d
fbhnscb,t1_fbhm3uc,so the cabin was moving? & what is the broken kids meaning? what was the girls purpose towards him? im confused about a lot lmao sorry,t3_ed812d
fbhodum,t1_fbhnscb,"Oh, that's alright. I think it's important to get feedback and learn from my mistakes. 


1) No, the giant (the Protector) is carrying him away. 


2) The kid isn't broken. The kid is just really sad that he won't be getting a home. 


3) Alice had lured him to the cabin to be eaten by the Protector as an offering. Earlier in the story, she had briefly mentioned that the Protector needs an offering every few months. But lately, he's demanded children to be offered to him.",t3_ed812d
