fbocgaw,t3_ee3bkw,"She have a really weird way of making a soup.

Soup aside, terrifying. I don't know what I would do when the surrounding are on fire, and there's no way to get out. With me being uncomfortable in closed space, being boiled inside a bathtub might be more painful than running through the fire and flames.",t3_ee3bkw
fbqqxeu,t3_ee3bkw,This is horrifying,t3_ee3bkw
fbr68ie,t3_ee3bkw,"I heard a true ER Horror Story from a friend of a nurse. The house caught fire, and a little girl trapped herself in the bath tub with water. The shower curtain was plastic...",t3_ee3bkw
fbrswvu,t3_ee3bkw,"Read this while holding my baby. Heâ€™s sick and napping. Terrifying. 
Canâ€™t imagine.  

In regards to your writing I really enjoyed the repetition of the beginning and ending lines.",t3_ee3bkw
fbrwv6e,t3_ee3bkw,This is so incredibly well-written! I love that you book ended it with the same sentence and that time it had an entirely different meaning. Chills!,t3_ee3bkw
fbrwxte,t3_ee3bkw,Is this loosely based on the current Australian bushfires?,t3_ee3bkw
fbs2i6w,t3_ee3bkw,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but if she knew there was a forest fire approaching couldn't she have just left with the baby when the husband didn't return after 24 hours or so instead of just staying at the house?",t3_ee3bkw
fbrvky7,t3_ee3bkw,Excellent story OP!,t3_ee3bkw

fbsp8f4,t3_ee3bkw,"I thought I wanted better scary stories than just the ones with a creature or monster in them but this was too much for me. Great writing skills and it very much traumatized me, so good job!

Now I'm going back to the time traveling ghosts of No Sleep.",t3_ee3bkw
fbtqdpw,t3_ee3bkw,I hate fire :(,t3_ee3bkw
fbpi6t5,t1_fbocgaw,"Or succumbing to smoke inhalation, given a choice!",t3_ee3bkw
fboxp73,t1_fbocgaw,I literally see your comment on every story. ðŸ˜‚,t3_ee3bkw
fbqg5ru,t1_fbocgaw,Do remember the baby but yeah I'd run through the fire,t3_ee3bkw
fbrevv3,t1_fbr68ie,Oh god this is horrible! My story is loosely based on a news story my mum told me about years ago during the Australian bushfires. Some people tried to hide in the bathtub but ended up dying anyway and it just seemed like such a horrible way to die. I was like 15 then and it really traumatised me (thanks mum!).,t3_ee3bkw
fbujzvi,t1_fbr68ie,"Sorry for sounding ignorant, but what would the plastic curtains do?",t3_ee3bkw
fbskztq,t1_fbrswvu,Thank you! Glad you enjoyed it. Hope your bubba feels better soon!,t3_ee3bkw
fbs2w11,t1_fbrswvu,"Ditto, but just on the second part (I choose to live a child free life; dogs are great).",t3_ee3bkw
fbs50b0,t1_fbrwv6e,Thank you so much! Itâ€™s my first story so Iâ€™m really glad you liked it.,t3_ee3bkw
fbs4x3v,t1_fbrwxte,"No, it was the really bad ones about 10 years ago. My mum told me about a similar case and it really stuck with me. Those fires can just move so fast people donâ€™t have time to do anything.",t3_ee3bkw
fbs9l93,t1_fbs2i6w,After the power cut he went out to get supplies but got caught in the fires and died. She knew about the fires but believed they were still a safe distance away. She didnâ€™t have a car and living so remotely she didnâ€™t have anywhere to go.,t3_ee3bkw
fbs5w0f,t1_fbrvky7,Thank you so much!,t3_ee3bkw
fbsqqsq,t1_fbsp8f4,Thank you! Sorry for traumatising you but I guess it means I did my job.,t3_ee3bkw
fbpjqjb,t1_fbpi6t5,"Knowing me and my luck, I'd probably just end up dying from falling down the stairs or something.",t3_ee3bkw
fbr8j8x,t1_fbpi6t5,Like niki lauda in 1976 though he lived and died earlier this year,t3_ee3bkw
fbq48k2,t1_fboxp73,"I know, for the past like three days all I see is his/her comments xD",t3_ee3bkw
fbpb1xu,t1_fboxp73,I'm just a bored person browsing this subreddit. :D,t3_ee3bkw
fbqju1u,t1_fbqg5ru,More flavor for the soup!,t3_ee3bkw
fbrnw4y,t1_fbrevv3,"Either that was a very hot fire (electrical fire,  explosion, etc) or they likely died from smoke inhalation, which isn't nearly as bad a death.",t3_ee3bkw
fbwucvr,t1_fbujzvi,"Learning is the exact opposite of ignorance. Plastic becomes molten when heated, and it melted to her face and body.",t3_ee3bkw
fbw4ulz,t1_fbujzvi,Ever microwave a non-microwavable plastic container?,t3_ee3bkw
fbsl46i,t1_fbs2w11,Thank you! I am child free too but we have cats instead of dogs!,t3_ee3bkw
fbtnmqt,t1_fbs4x3v,"Oh ok, I remember having to evacuate when I was younger, i remember the sky being so dark (10 years ago I think) but yes the current fires are very devastating, Iâ€™m in Victoria so hasnâ€™t affected us as much but watching the news each night is just horrible.",t3_ee3bkw
fbtjg11,t1_fbs4x3v,the ones now  are  just about worse,t3_ee3bkw
fbs5xdt,t1_fbs5w0f,Oh no problem!,t3_ee3bkw
fbpk667,t1_fbpjqjb,I'd take that over boiling alive.,t3_ee3bkw

fbq45nc,t1_fbpk667,Makes the two of us then ahah,t3_ee3bkw
fbs3gwn,t1_fbs3gq1,"I noticed one of these... :( 



 So here take this... :D",t3_ee3bkw
fbwmgt1,t1_fbwb4ef,"Thank you,  it was quite scary for a small child, I remembered being worried about my Dad because he stayed to look after our pets, but it really was nothing like the current ones itâ€™s really sad how many homes have been lost...",t3_ee3bkw
fbs4d7i,t1_fbs3gwn,Good bot. Thank you.,t3_ee3bkw
