f8plkna,t3_e1du4u,"This is a real life horror story for many people I believe.  


For me it wasn't my mother, it was my grandmother, trying to guilt-trip me into a good christian life. At least she didn't try to kidnap someone. She just called an exorcist for my sister and me lol",t3_e1du4u
f8pwjbt,t3_e1du4u,"There's a woman who posts all the time on r/justnoMIL, I thought this was her mother in law!",t3_e1du4u
f8ojn9m,t3_e1du4u,"Sorry I can't enjoy the story, you character actually annoy me into hating her... Like that was the objective but I ended angry after reading this.


Good job on making the most annoying lady ever.

Nice use of capslock btw.",t3_e1du4u
f8of8dk,t3_e1du4u,YIKES,t3_e1du4u
f8qdz3v,t3_e1du4u,"Gonna be honest, I was TERRIFIED that my own family would react this way when they found out about the baby my fiancÃ©e and I are having. Especially since Iâ€™m Catholic and sheâ€™s agnostic. Thankfully, after the initial shock, theyâ€™ve been nothing but loving and supportive of our impending marriage and are proud of us for wanting to be parents ourselves.",t3_e1du4u
f8p6x2z,t3_e1du4u,Sounds like most mothers jealous of their sons wives,t3_e1du4u
f8puge1,t3_e1du4u,"lmao imagine if the twins ARE actual hellspawns. (also, congrats on making a very detestable character, op)",t3_e1du4u
f8q1aqq,t3_e1du4u,Thought I was reading entitled parents at first... terrifying,t3_e1du4u
f8q31cb,t3_e1du4u,"The scary thing is that there are really people like this out there, and I'm sure this scenario has actually happened",t3_e1du4u
f8pe69j,t3_e1du4u,I love it and hate it at the same time! Great work!,t3_e1du4u
f8tdndp,t3_e1du4u,"Wanna say ""can't relate"" because my future MIL is actually an angel...

But wait. This sounds just like my fiance's stepmother. ðŸ’”ðŸ¤·",t3_e1du4u
f8rwp25,t1_f8ofk9f,People who think like this vote.,t3_e1du4u
f8qz20t,t1_f8plkna,"My mil is this type. After I told her I would not be ""rasing thr babies the way she wants them raised"" (after she yelled at me saying shes raised kids before I need to do it her way as if they weren't my Damn kids or something) she went bat shit crazy. She had been only treating me badly when her son wasn't around before this. Then she went crazy while I was 4 months pregnant with rainbow baby who turned out to be my 1st girl (I was also high risk due to a late term miscarriage as well as health issues so the fact that she got me so upset that i had a panic attack really made me mad). She literally freaked out screaming saying ""you will do what I say when it comes to the kids"" ans a bunch of other crazy nonsense. Her son tried to get her to stop but was in shock himself becuase he didn't know how bad she was when he wasn't there. I ended up having to call the police becuase she blocked me in a room and wouldnt let me out untill "" I listened to her and did what she said"" now we don't talk to her and have her blocked. So much more crazy happened before that though. She also was very religious to the point that we were evil Nazis becuase we didmt have the same views as her.",t3_e1du4u
f8rwyvc,t1_f8qdz3v,"Having a mixed relationship with religious, atheistic, or any other worlds views can work. You just gotta be honest, respectful, and be willing to compromise on some things other couples sometimes don't have to worry about.

That said: Having supportive family can make all of that sooooooo much easier. I'm happy for you guys. Congrats!",t3_e1du4u
f8rwrkg,t1_f8puge1,But then they have an adorable loving Adams Family thing going and don't care.,t3_e1du4u
f8t6rvf,t1_f8rwp25,"It still amazes me that intelligent people actually believe the lies of politicians, and take them at face value!",t3_e1du4u
f8s2q6x,t1_f8qz20t,"Holy fuck! First of all, are you and your baby OK?

I can't grasp how people can be like this, seriously. Sure, everyone does stupid, wrong things in their life, but it takes something to be THAT crazy. These overly religious people usually just push everyone away from them and from their religion instead of helping. When I was very young I let them pressure me into attending church and one of these christian youth clubs, in which I actually had fun. But over the course of maybe 1-2 years I realized that the whole belief seemed so shallow and just wasn't for me. That's when the drama started... My sister is 10 years older and got it even worse from especially my grandma. And now that hag around 95 years old, close to dying and is wondering why we don't give a shit about her.",t3_e1du4u
