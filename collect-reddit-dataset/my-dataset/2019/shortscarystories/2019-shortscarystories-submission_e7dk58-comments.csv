fa05nsg,t3_e7dk58,I thought this would just be another one about the holocaust but damn did that take a twist and I loved it,t3_e7dk58
f9z3zmw,t3_e7dk58,This would be a good premise for a horror movie,t3_e7dk58
f9yv15a,t3_e7dk58,Got me nice and pretty. Good one fam.,t3_e7dk58

fa0thii,t3_e7dk58,What a turn at the very last second! Perfect!,t3_e7dk58
f9ywjcd,t3_e7dk58,Damn! That's an unexpected twist to the military worship that goes on in this country!,t3_e7dk58
fa137t7,t3_e7dk58,oh hell yeah this is a good one,t3_e7dk58
fa0v29c,t3_e7dk58,"A cousin of mine was honored every year in a small town in Belgium because he liberated the town or told them the Army had pushed them back. It was Conde, Belgium. Sorry great story too btw.",t3_e7dk58
fa17fr1,t3_e7dk58,QUE?!,t3_e7dk58
fa1mb6g,t3_e7dk58,I totally thought that this was r/confessions for a second and LET ME TELL YOU I was about to call the UN of something,t3_e7dk58
fa271ga,t3_e7dk58,"Kudos!  It is rare that something takes me completely by surprise.... I actually gasped at the end.  Well done, thank you.",t3_e7dk58
fa1mvg4,t3_e7dk58,I was thinking you chose the wrong sub for a bit,t3_e7dk58
fa1phms,t3_e7dk58,Holy shit. This twist!!! I love it!!,t3_e7dk58
fa1rqci,t3_e7dk58,My stomach dropped at the ending! Love it.,t3_e7dk58

fa2zsz5,t3_e7dk58,"Damn was not expecting that twist lmao, good job!",t3_e7dk58
fag9z8u,t3_e7dk58,Ugh FUCK lmao,t3_e7dk58
fa0qrjj,t3_e7dk58,"They saved us, their clothes saved us from dying of  cold and their flesh saved us from dying of hunger.
Great story just maybe the last line does not quite fit the overall atmosphere.",t3_e7dk58
fa17uey,t3_e7dk58,Nah donâ€™t beat yourself up this story was great !!!!,t3_e7dk58
fa19oae,t3_e7dk58,What a great story! Hella got me in the end,t3_e7dk58
fa1as5s,t3_e7dk58,Damn. That was a good ending.,t3_e7dk58
fa1d4f8,t3_e7dk58,Great delivery I was thinking this was posted in the wrong sub,t3_e7dk58
fa1hzle,t3_e7dk58,Very good surprise ending. Now write a story about how it all went down.,t3_e7dk58
fan9g0k,t3_e7dk58,"As a Belgian, I was slightly annoyed by the glorification of the US army (as that is pretty unusual here, we're grateful but not like the OP here), until the last line. Well done",t3_e7dk58
fbfn15p,t3_e7dk58,"Is it bad that I laughed?

It's probably bad.",t3_e7dk58
fan23d8,t3_e7dk58,"The commenter just before me thought that a more vague cannibalism reference would have been better. I don't know whether that's right or wrong, but I was so completely surprised and not expecting that last sentence that it didn't matter whether it was subtle or over-the-top, I had to think for a second before I realized what I just read. I was wondering why you laid it on thick throughout, praising the military. I see now it was to lull me into a false sense of security before that one sentence of horror. Very well done",t3_e7dk58
f9ztk7j,t3_e7dk58,last line kind of ruins it for me TBH but good none the less,t3_e7dk58
fa087bi,t1_fa05nsg,Ty!,t3_e7dk58
fa15fri,t1_fa0qrjj,Isn't that the point of the last line?,t3_e7dk58
fanezuz,t1_fan9g0k,I'm Dutch and I also don't have a lot of warm feelings for foreign military powers. I know they did some stuff but I never really felt that close to them.,t3_e7dk58
fanf1pl,t1_fan23d8,Thank you!,t3_e7dk58
fa07jyr,t1_f9ztk7j,"Without the last line it wouldnâ€™t fit the sub at all though, it would just be an old personâ€™s sentimental reflection.",t3_e7dk58
fa086ut,t1_f9ztk7j,The last line is kind of necesarry for the twist,t3_e7dk58
f9zutut,t1_f9ztk7j,"Yeah, they probably would have been better with a bit of salt, but what can you do with war time rationing?",t3_e7dk58
fa5noh8,t1_fa15fri,I mean the last line seems too cheesy about the taste. A more vague cannibalism reference would suit better.,t3_e7dk58
fanqhve,t1_fanezuz,"Right? We could've opted out of the war, Germany offered us peaceful takeover if we let them through without a fight! But our king and people decided to fight for what they believed was right. Our army was tiny, but they fought for months against a much bigger enemy, with all they got. 


Would we have lost without the US army? Absolutely. And they changed the course of history, and deserve recognition for that, which they get. But that doesn't mean our army didn't fight with all they got, and they deserve some recognition too.


ETA: not to mention the presidents still use this excuse to go fights wars where they shouldn't be",t3_e7dk58
fa080t0,t1_fa07jyr,"I'm not saying it should be removed, just made into something a bit more vague.",t3_e7dk58
fa08mn6,t1_fa086ut,"Good story, don't get me wrong, just sounds kind of blunt to me.",t3_e7dk58
fanrxq4,t1_fanqhve,"We fought for 4 days till the germans were like ""fuck these guys"" 
and bombed rotterdam to the ground.
It would've been better if we surrendered and spared our troops for the second round",t3_e7dk58
fa0appx,t1_fa08mn6,"Totaly get it, It felt off to me too, had to force that twist in.
Hey can't always make a good story",t3_e7dk58
fans4h8,t1_fanrxq4,We weren't even worth bombing (thank god!). War is awful. Still a really good story though,t3_e7dk58
fa1f36c,t1_fa0appx,"You did make a good story. The blunt ending really shocked me and that's rare. That's just one perspective, but I hope you take it in all its sincerity. I loved it!

Although, if you redo it and draw it out more since you feel it's **too** blunt I'd read it again!",t3_e7dk58
fa1738n,t1_fa0appx,"I think there are more subtle ways you could introduce the twist. Explicitly confirming that they ate people is jarring enough that it will take some people out of the story. 

My issue is more that the story in no way explains how emaciated, freezing Germans somehow managed to kill soldiers.",t3_e7dk58
fa3tn6u,t1_fa1f36c,"Yeah, I agree it was pretty blunt, I was really struggeling with fitting in the ending without interupting the flow of the story.
Thanks anyway!",t3_e7dk58
fa52nlk,t1_fa3tn6u,"Just to reiterate, I am not criticising!  I think it's great exactly the way it is.",t3_e7dk58
