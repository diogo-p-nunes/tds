fb6xr12,t3_ebr7ny,Now I’m wondering if cremation would be better or worse in this scenario.,t3_ebr7ny

fb7fx7t,t1_fb6xr12,"I was thinking but wasnt sure where to go with it. Do you think he would still be aware if there wasnt a body left for him to be bound to? Or is ash enough? Oh lord, if the ash got spread would he feel every particle?",t3_ebr7ny
fb7nznb,t1_fb7fx7t,Lol!!! That’s exactly where my mind went! Would cremation cease his awareness of consciousness? Or worse-as you said- be burned into a million particles that could ALL simultaneously feel pain and eternal consciousness.... I’m supposed to be getting ready for work and you got me here speculating. Lol. That’s how you know you wrote an interesting story. Kudos,t3_ebr7ny
