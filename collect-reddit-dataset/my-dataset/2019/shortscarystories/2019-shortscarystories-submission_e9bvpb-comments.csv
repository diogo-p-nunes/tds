faicfrq,t3_e9bvpb,"It is nice, but i think you wrote ""everything happens for a reason"" so often it lost the power.

There is a thing in pathern making were things are more ""beautiful"" when in 3 and 5 (i am not sure on the 5).

I would replace enough to have only 3 of the phrase.

One in the beginning, like you did, for set up, then use a bunch of replacement words... 

Have one at the start, one in the middle, and one at the end how you did.

10/23 of your lines are this (counting the title) that is almost half your text, it got actually annoying by the end.",t3_e9bvpb

faii29x,t1_faidmkw,"Don't get discouraged tho, the person that commented had some good criticism but the story is still very good",t3_e9bvpb
faiqvjz,t1_faidmkw,"Eww, creepy and pointed. I like it!

To comment on the repeated line - I'm a big fan of using repetition, and when I feel like it's too much I'll shuffle the wording slightly in a few instances to go for a different effect, and then bring it back to the true line at the end for a punch. You can probably incorporate that beautifully with your writing style!",t3_e9bvpb
fajg7o1,t1_faidmkw,"fwiw, I see where the other commenter is coming from but I like the use of repetition. I think it could be cleaned up/pared down a little, but it's a valid technique and you used it pretty well imo.",t3_e9bvpb

faim334,t1_faikcf2,"Yeah, and I think they were a little out of line saying it got annoying. I would definitely take their advice, but I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying it was annoying. I enjoyed reading it",t3_e9bvpb
