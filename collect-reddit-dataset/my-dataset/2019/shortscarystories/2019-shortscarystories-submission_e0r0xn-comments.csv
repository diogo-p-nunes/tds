f8gneum,t3_e0r0xn,"As I read the first sentence, I knew that nothing good would happen at a meat factory. You used so few words to instill a sense of horror in your readers. ""Deranged eco-terrorists"" could only mean one thing would happen, but it was worse than I thought.  I thought ""simple slaughter"" of the employees. But, the eco-terrorists burned someone alive. AAAAAHHHH.  

Note to the eco-terrorists: If you are going to go after someone, why not the CEO, or Board Members.",t3_e0r0xn
f8g9kqd,t3_e0r0xn,Shit thats fucked up,t3_e0r0xn
f8hiepq,t3_e0r0xn,I hated working factories they always creeped me out. I had to learn lock out tag out and get osha certified for my last job at a massive glass fscptry. Could walk for 20 minutes and not see a single other person. Now I'm even more glad I don't work in a factory any more. If I ever do again this story will always be creeping me out on the back of my mind,t3_e0r0xn
