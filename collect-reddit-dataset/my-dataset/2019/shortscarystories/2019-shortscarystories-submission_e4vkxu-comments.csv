f9i0ivs,t3_e4vkxu,I’ve noticed that meta posts are usually a hit or miss on this subreddit (I have another writing account I use). I would suggest keeping those to a minimum. I personally read these stories to get away from everyday life and it’s hard to enjoy meta stories because they’re so difficult to get into. Hope to see more stories in the future though!,t3_e4vkxu

f9gywbu,t1_f9fpsdm,"No Obnoxious Commentary. This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.",t3_e4vkxu
