f8sfhi9,t3_e1y1g1,"Needs work friend.  Suggest proofread and verb tense review. 

Suggest expand on the plot.  Is this an ancient horror captured in the tree?  Is the granddad from a bloodline of guardians, sworn to protect others from being trapped by the tree and thus prevent the horror from escaping and damning the world?  Use the remaining word count to expand the story!",t3_e1y1g1
f8sh238,t1_f8sfhi9,Can you suggest some way to proofread review? Most of my story I check using grammar checker online and I can't find any solution to this problem. Thank you.,t3_e1y1g1
f8tcn9o,t1_f8sh238,"Grammar check won’t find verb tense issues. Try reading it out loud to yourself, or just play it safe and ALWAYS write in past tense. Your story is not happening now or tomorrow. It already happened even if just 5 minutes ago. Past tense is the majority of any book you’ll read.",t3_e1y1g1
