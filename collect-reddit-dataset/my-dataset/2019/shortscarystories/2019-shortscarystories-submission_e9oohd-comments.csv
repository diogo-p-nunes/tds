fakb3jy,t3_e9oohd,"Hum, this story is good. But the way you separated the paragraphs can be improved!

For example, separate the final few scenes in the last part. It'll create a better suspense. And instead of directly saying the you stabbed him, say something like 'the knife flashed' or 'blood strayed', it will make the build-up crash harder.

And the build-up of the story simply wasn't enough. The way you separated the paragraphs really made this piece dull. The wording was good; I loved the idea but the paragraphs aren't separated right and that ruined the build-up so there wasn't enough suspense.

Try to make the story build-up, make the readers tense and make the last sentence the snap and let everything crash down. Like a punch. Keep pulling back, gathering strength without the reader's noticing then strike them full in the face.

But what do I know, I'm just a high schooler who isn't even that good at writing.üòäüòä",t3_e9oohd
fakqcb8,t3_e9oohd,Looked behind me immediately after hahahaa well done I liked it!!,t3_e9oohd
famdvac,t3_e9oohd,"Good try, an interesting take on Christmas. Interesting to read, but the ending was underwhelming. I think you have good potential though, keep writing. You already know how to think outside the box and that's great. :)",t3_e9oohd
fakc235,t1_fakb3jy,Thanks for your response! We had an assignment in school that was about writing a Christmas story. I handed it in to my teacher and thought that I could post it on reddit for fun. I wrote this one in just one English lesson so I agree that I could've worked more with it. You sound like an experienced writer though!üëç,t3_e9oohd
fal9xyg,t1_fakqcb8,Of course nothing was going to happen but I was lying on my bed reading this so it didn't work.,t3_e9oohd
fakcl2q,t1_fakc235,"Nah, I just like analysing other stories like really well-written fanfics and books, I write a bit myself to practise too but I'm really not that good. Most of this came from the analysis, which I really recommend doing! It helps with your writing a lot!",t3_e9oohd
falrfgw,t1_fakc235,Tell us what your teacher tought please!,t3_e9oohd
