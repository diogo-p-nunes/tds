fchnit4,t3_eh8w0b,"I loved this! Was not expecting him to be a werewolf (if im assuming correctly haha) and I loved when he thanked his father for letting him hunt so then the entire story makes sense from that point of view. I did like how you ended it with the father saying ""besides, he was right, you don't take your valuables to the grave.""",t3_eh8w0b
fci9qf7,t3_eh8w0b,"Looks like the thugs, had a ruff night.
(Does dog pun works if it's a werewolf?)

Unfunny jokes aside, good story. Reading it, you know well enough that the thugs is going to die, but you just don't know how. Will the father be a murderer? Will he actually give his valuable? But suddenly BAM, son get shot, werewolf time. I also like how the father took the gold chain from the thugs, mocking them with the ""you don't take valuable to the grave"" line. Nice one.",t3_eh8w0b

fchq45s,t1_fchnit4,"Thank you, It was my first time posting and I was very careful with the word count up until 300 words and then I got bored of going back and forth on wordcount and just typed it all and when I finished I had over 700 words so it was very hard to slim it down and still retain the base story.

I'm glad you liked the twist(you assumed right) I was going for that the second read thru you catch the little details that make the story complete.

And the ending had to be the culmination of the whole piece.",t3_eh8w0b
