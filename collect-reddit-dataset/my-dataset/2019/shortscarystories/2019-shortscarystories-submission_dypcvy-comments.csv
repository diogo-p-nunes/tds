f832sbu,t1_f832dz5,"Thank you and it's Munchausen syndrome by proxy to be exact, it's a mental illness and a kind of child abuse where the parent usually a female makes a child either act sick or be sick",t3_dypcvy
f83yhot,t1_f832dz5,"To add to that: they do it to get attention and sympathy (also, it‚Äôs usually a mother doing it to their child but it can be any kind of caregiver to the person they‚Äôre caring for). In regular Munchausens, the person does it to themselves to get attention and sympathy, primarily from medical professionals, but in by proxy, they want the attention from being the (selfless/burdened/struggling/etc.) caregiver, and ofc the victim can‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, so while with regular munchausen the person may just lie about symptoms, in MbP they need to actually make the victim sick",t3_dypcvy

f83yko4,t1_f83yis8,That's not that point of this subreddit and undermines the author as an artist.,t3_dypcvy
f84791e,t1_f832sbu,"Sorry to but in, but the story about gypsy where she was made to act sick be in a wheelchair take tons of meds and even operations, then she met  a boy on line and they killed the mother, of course they are both in prison now, just wanted to share ,It's a great example for Munchausen  syndrome...correct grammar example for Munch",t3_dypcvy
f84iqp4,t1_f832sbu,You forgot the part about attention. They usually do it for attention and the feels.,t3_dypcvy
f84la58,t1_f83yhot,"ok thank you, that makes more sense. when i looked it up online i was only getting results for normal munchausens, not by proxy.",t3_dypcvy
f83yqhi,t1_f83yko4,"Holy shit I thought I was the only one who thought this. Nosleep is fucking ridiculous, all the criticism gets deleted.",t3_dypcvy
f83yvd8,t1_f83yqhi,"I don't mind the concept of nosleep, I like the idea of immersion with the story. I just really think that kind of thing should stay there because I think authors deserve some acknowledgement as creators. I also thorough dislike that we need to continue the charade even when the story in nosleep is poorly written and makes no sense. There's no believability.",t3_dypcvy
f83z3pa,t1_f83yvd8,"I agree, I dont want to come off as that bitch but there have been seemingly mediocre authors getting 1000+ upvotes, possibly votebotting or something. Also this sub bans any multiple part stories which almost always have dumb endings in the other sub.",t3_dypcvy
f83zbky,t1_f83z3pa,"Yeah, I think part of the appeal in nosleep is that no one can critique the writing, so lazy writers go there, and flood out anyone who is trying. Plus, the concept is appealing to younger people who generally don't have the most polished writing skills to begin with.

And yeah, if I want something chaptered, I just go to an actual writing forum.",t3_dypcvy
