f9gsda9,t3_e4zg4b,"Wow, I wish I could upvote this more than once. The twist completely reframed the previous sentences, and shows everything in a different light. You did an amazing job.",t3_e4zg4b
f9gynby,t3_e4zg4b,It's amazing how one sentence changed the entire perception of the story. Very clever.,t3_e4zg4b
f9h2vpt,t3_e4zg4b,Thought it was going to be a dude looking through the scope of a gun. Nice ending!,t3_e4zg4b
f9gsmi0,t3_e4zg4b,Loved this - had to read a second time,t3_e4zg4b
f9hqrme,t3_e4zg4b,I was very worried it was going to be about a dog locked up inside and I’m very pleased with the ending.,t3_e4zg4b
f9iymp2,t3_e4zg4b,"I really like this style of writing. ""*Though, as I see lips dance in idle chatter, or eyes widen at an imagined rumour, how I crave to be privy to such conversations, how I wish to indulge in such gab or gossip, how my surrounding quiet isolates me.""* The sentence is such a beautiful run-on, and the last clause especially is a great ending to the story before the twist.",t3_e4zg4b
f9hu1pn,t3_e4zg4b,I get it now. It really is fantastic writing now that I’m able to understand it! The descriptions of the interactions have a double meaning which I didn’t notice before! Very cleverly done!,t3_e4zg4b
f9ho9of,t3_e4zg4b,"This reminds me of The Bunker Diary. If anyone enjoyed this as much as I, you've gotta read that book!!",t3_e4zg4b
f9hlkwj,t3_e4zg4b,Can someone explain?,t3_e4zg4b
f9j7fcu,t3_e4zg4b,"There should be a sub where the story could either be wholesome or scary, but you can know that only in the final line.",t3_e4zg4b
f9ig2rq,t3_e4zg4b,That was perfectly executed.,t3_e4zg4b
f9izi2r,t3_e4zg4b,"Love the wordplay.

Exciting and enticing!",t3_e4zg4b
f9in3il,t3_e4zg4b,"Not only was the twist great, the writing was beautiful and poetic!",t3_e4zg4b
f9khgkz,t3_e4zg4b,">a gang of teenagers out of school leaning tense against a wall wondering if they're going be found, or an irate businesswoman fidgeting and fixing her suit whilst tirelessly trying to make calls

Damn",t3_e4zg4b
f9il3qr,t3_e4zg4b,That last sentence was an awesome twist. I see what you did there............and I liked that.,t3_e4zg4b
f9is7xz,t3_e4zg4b,Very nice. It’s rare to find this type of twist that transforms the story on a se bod read through. Well done.,t3_e4zg4b
f9j7b8o,t3_e4zg4b,"This is an amazing story, the ending gives so much more context to the first part.",t3_e4zg4b
f9kex4e,t3_e4zg4b,"It sounded like the perspective of a grounded ghost, or home-bound recluse at first. Q_Q",t3_e4zg4b
f9lf7c3,t3_e4zg4b,This is absolutely amazing,t3_e4zg4b
fag849c,t3_e4zg4b,Jesus christ,t3_e4zg4b
fb5usuu,t3_e4zg4b,Omg that was amazing. After the ending and then re-reading the story it took on a whole new meaning. Well done.,t3_e4zg4b
fck1fcn,t3_e4zg4b,I love this! First one that made me go 'oooh' out loud,t3_e4zg4b
fcmeuue,t3_e4zg4b,"This feels very JTHM to me...


I like it.",t3_e4zg4b
f9k8jru,t1_f9gsda9,Couldnt agree more!!,t3_e4zg4b
f9hf0dk,t1_f9h2vpt,That actually also sounds like a good story,t3_e4zg4b
f9hyjeh,t1_f9hqrme,"The fact that you are pleased to find out that it is perhaps a dozen or more human prisoners, as opposed to a dog left alone at home while his human is out, very much cements your choice of username.  No judgement, really, simply an observation that some of us are far more honest with ourselves when taking personal inventory.

Hell, just take a look at my poor choice in username.  It is not very revealing at all, in comparison.  Take care ❤",t3_e4zg4b
f9hltcn,t1_f9hlkwj,"It's written as if the narrator is just people-watching, but the end indicates that the narrator has, in fact, captured these people. It's silent because there's sound proofing glass so that the ""cops don't hear them screaming"".",t3_e4zg4b
f9jl58c,t1_f9j7fcu,PLS,t3_e4zg4b
f9kh96f,t1_f9hyjeh,This is one weird-ass comment,t3_e4zg4b
fadpugk,t1_f9hyjeh,"To be fair, I'm always more concerned about the animals over human beings in any horror fiction situation (And non-fiction to be fair... I can't watch any nature programmes for the same reason)",t3_e4zg4b
f9hqtsy,t1_f9hltcn,I assumed ither people rather than the people the narrator is watching.,t3_e4zg4b
f9htz2v,t1_f9hltcn,I get it now. It really is fantastic writing now that I’m able to understand it! The descriptions of the interactions have a double meaning which I didn’t notice before! Very cleverly done!,t3_e4zg4b
f9hsnk4,t1_f9hqtsy,"I assumed the same thing, but after rereading it, their activities can apply to prisoners, too. It's really good writing.",t3_e4zg4b
