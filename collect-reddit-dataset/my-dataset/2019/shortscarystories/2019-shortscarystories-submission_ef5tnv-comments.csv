I warned you only 20 hours ago about your violation of the 24 hour rule (the details of which have been stickied at the top of the sub for a month)

You chose to break that same rule again.

Either-

a) You think the rules don't apply to you

b) You didn't bother to read the rules

or

c) You think the mods are too apathetic or stupid to notice that you keep coloring outside the lines.

I am giving you a two day ban as a warning to deter you from ignoring the posted rules and the subsequent mod corrections again.",t3_ef5tnv
