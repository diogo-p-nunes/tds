f8q1069,t3_e1k0sa,"Well the police wouldn‚Äôt leave that message. But if you want to include a message from the police it might be something like this:

‚ÄúWe found your number listed as an emergency contact for an unknown female found in the park. We would like you to come down to identify her body and her belongings, including a pink scarf.‚Äù 

Though that may be too on the nose too. It‚Äôs hard to get the police to mention a pink scarf in a natural way.",t3_e1k0sa

f8pyg7x,t3_e1k0sa,"Can't write much at the moment, might get back on later.  I can say, though, that I liked it.  I thought the drunk message was funny.  A nice little bit of humor.",t3_e1k0sa
f8q94s0,t3_e1k0sa,"This gave me chills because I've been Mary in this story, without the final bit.

This gave me chills because my father had a professor at university who killed the boyfriend of one of his students because he was obsessed with her.

Criticism / feedback:  The timeline at the end seems really rushed, but not \*impossible\*.  I would probably have re-ordered the sequence -- he calls/texts saying 'no need to worry' >> she can't get ahold of her friend (maybe 'hi this is jane's voicemail, leave me a message!' a couple times?  or perhaps a text or two asking Jane where she is?) >> PD call >> creepy af ending.

And the PD dialogue could be tweaked a bit.

Overall, well done.  solid 7/10.",t3_e1k0sa

f8qeg0k,t3_e1k0sa,"I love stories like this that use alternate formats (letters, text messages) they're always really creative.

That said, the police part felt a little... rushed? I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, it just feels a bit robotic. The rest is awesome though.",t3_e1k0sa

f8q8me9,t1_f8q1069,"Honestly, I don't think the message from the police needs to mention a pink scarf. That should be easy enough for us to fill in on our own.",t3_e1k0sa
f8qcna4,t1_f8q1069,"I know, I tried it in multiple ways but each time it came out wrong and often I ended up crossing the word limit. 
It always came out forced. 
But I like your method better, feels more natural. 
Thanks for your advice.",t3_e1k0sa
f8q9duv,t1_f8q1069,"Yeah, the pink scarf is obviously important to mention, but getting it to sound authentic inre:PD procedure while mentioning the scarf is a bit tricky.  I'm trying to figure out how I'd word it....",t3_e1k0sa
f8qqfhw,t1_f8q1069,"Honestly, a message from another friend asking if Mary had seen Jane, they were supposed to meet blah blah blah, and then a brief request from police to come to the station or another message from a friend saying Jane had been found dead would have felt more natural.",t3_e1k0sa

f8qsm3p,t1_f8pqbl4,"My only criticism is with the message where Henry was drunk‚Äîyou could‚Äôve conveyed that without the asterisks indicating ‚Äúdrunk,‚Äù ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù, and ‚Äúpuking noises.‚Äù

Love the idea and the format!",t3_e1k0sa

f8qvdhe,t1_f8pqbl4,"Personally, I felt like the end was a bit too obvious/expected. Since you've already got what appear to be texts from Jane and the PD, I think it would have felt more natural if Henry hadn't mentioned the scarf in his messages, and instead have a couple brief sections of texts from Jane about the scarf. That way her murder is still foreshadowed, but not so directly by Henry himself.",t3_e1k0sa

f8qdjym,t1_f8q94s0,"The idea of being stalked is really scary. I hope you are better and safe now. 

I know somebody who is on the other side and did the stalking (however not even close to what I have written in the story). It took me and some other friends a lot of time to convince him to back off. Thankfully he realized he was wrong.

Thank you for your advice. I will focus on the pacing and dialogue more.",t3_e1k0sa

My ex-husband‚Äôs mistress used the latter to contact him after he had promised me that they were no longer in contact in a semi-successful attempt to get me to let him move back into ‚Äúour‚Äù house. They were stupid about it though; they used it excessively (also, I‚Äôm not an idiot - texting back-and-forth to a different number every night after I went to bed is a dead giveaway).

I'm really glad to hear that you got through to someone on the other side of the situation -- I have a hard time forgiving / seeing past some things that people may have done in their past, but that doesn't make it any less important for those who CAN see past those things to foster environments where those people have a second chance to get it right.    


I'm also glad my feedback was helpful!  That's one of the hardest things for me as a writer.  (I did an open mic once and I can't think of a more terrifying situation of sharing my work in progress with a room full of strangers.)",t3_e1k0sa

And than after a time gap the ending would have been with Jane calling Mary

Mary, its Jane. Please run, he has the house keys.
