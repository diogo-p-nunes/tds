f7f2d70,t3_dv1rrt,Succinctly scary description of an innocent suicide. I don’t think it can get any better than this.,t3_dv1rrt
f7b5t7q,t3_dv1rrt,"This was good! However, I advise putting up the trigger warning at the beginning instead of the end. It kind of defeats the purpose of the TR is at the end of something the reader has already read. Having it at the start of the story prepares the reader for sensitive content.",t3_dv1rrt

f7b430c,t1_f7b3lfp,"I think including a trigger warning would be good. I mean when I read it, all my years of self-harming came crashing down and I had sort of a panic attack. But please don't get me wrong, this is a really good story and is true for a lot of people. My apologies if my words seem to be offensive.",t3_dv1rrt
