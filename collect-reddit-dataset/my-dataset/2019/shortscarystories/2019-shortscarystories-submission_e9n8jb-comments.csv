fajwlps,t3_e9n8jb,"Oh God I love this one. The idea is fantastic! The build-up was good but the paragraphing can be improved, try linking them together maybe. I'd recommend having every day in two paragraphs. The rhythm would be better and the last part, ""the sims 4"" can be an individual paragraph. Separate it to tighten the suspense, do longer paragraphs then a short sentence to make the feels hit.

I really enjoyed this one, thanks and hope my advise helps!",t3_e9n8jb
faka0ym,t3_e9n8jb,"I love this. It actually is so good and original. But just a question, are there insect swarms in the Sims 4?",t3_e9n8jb
fakc4wz,t3_e9n8jb,"Mother. Effing. Slow clap. I can honestly say I didn't see it coming. When you talked about the door disappearing I thought you were making a ""House of Leaves"" reference (which only made me really want to pick up my copy...). And then those words in the sky... You hit me right in my guilty pleasure. lol I wish I could give you more than just an upvote. Well, played, OP! üòè",t3_e9n8jb
fajvsaj,t3_e9n8jb,God damn those sims 4 players,t3_e9n8jb
fak9h0v,t3_e9n8jb,Knew where you were going with this as soon as the door disappeared during the fire. Love it!!,t3_e9n8jb
fakaanr,t3_e9n8jb,This was good! There‚Äôs a sentence typo in the Wednesday paragraph. But I love the concept!,t3_e9n8jb
fakfcbn,t3_e9n8jb,"There's been other stories like this, but you handled the build up brilliantly, so I honestly didn't expect the ending. Nice work!!",t3_e9n8jb
falgust,t3_e9n8jb,"Up until the frozen part I thought this was about chickens still being conscious through death and being eaten, 

Monday was put in the fridge to marinate, 

Tuesday baked in the oven, 

Wednesday served and eaten, 

if it weren't for the blizzard part I would have kept going with Thursday being ending up in a toilet and the words in sky being something like ""Perdue"" or ""Poultry"".",t3_e9n8jb
fakhduw,t3_e9n8jb,"Oh my goodness! You really had me.
Now I feel so bad for my poor Sims years ago.",t3_e9n8jb

fakqlyo,t3_e9n8jb,"This feels so fresh! Way to go, OP",t3_e9n8jb
faksuao,t3_e9n8jb,"Lol, that was great. Took me a second to guess the end, but even when I did, still fun and horrifying if it turned out to be true.",t3_e9n8jb
fakx4y3,t3_e9n8jb,"Totally knew it was the sims at the part about the door disappearing before her eyes lol I thought I'd be wrong and it was just kind of a joke but nope, I was right. That's awesome.",t3_e9n8jb

fampqxh,t3_e9n8jb,"I love it! I don't play The Sims 4, but I used to play The Sims 3. The deaths were awesome, ranging from Mummy's Curse to being trapped in your own magic tricks! The ghosts were cool, as well!",t3_e9n8jb
famrkcp,t3_e9n8jb,"Great story! I would suggest fixing this sentence up but it's easily missed if the reader just does a quick read: ""and kept they ate her till the bone.""",t3_e9n8jb
