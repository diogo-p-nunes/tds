Memes aside, good one. The whole idea of time travelling and killing an evil person before they had the chance to do anything evil has travelled its way around the internet. Killing an evil person when they're a child would certainly be controversial, since they are still children after all. And who knows, maybe killing them would make another evil person to appear, changing history. Nice story.",t3_ehaveu

fcj259f,t3_ehaveu,Can someone please explain the ending to me? I’m kind of confused. Is he going to kill the kid or did he prevent the kid from becoming something worse by killing the man? Or is it something else?,t3_ehaveu
fcjjy83,t3_ehaveu,"Ouch.
I've read a lot on here recently that isn't horror. 
This is.
From so many angles this could be considered horror, horrible. Just horrid. 

Well done, my man.",t3_ehaveu

fcj8057,t1_fcj259f,"Great question. I would say killing the kid is the ending... but yeah, it’s a downer. I like some of your alternative endings!lol Definitely not an upper story by any means and who knows how John’s life could’ve turned out without the abuse he suffered at a young age?",t3_ehaveu
