f77gwub,t3_duosnn,"I got inspired to write this one after I had to close my eyes while taking a shower this morning, I felt like it was one if those things I used to fear when I was younger and heard all kinds of ghost stories having to do with bathrooms. 

Anyway, please let me know your feedback and I hope you enjoyed",t3_duosnn

f77wsv5,t3_duosnn,i thought this was r/unpopularopinion for a minute and i was truly horrified,t3_duosnn
f77w3c8,t3_duosnn,"Washing your body at the sink is more economical, anyway. You don't just save a lot of water, you're also more thorough because you can feel where you're not clean yet.

It won't stop them from watching, of course.",t3_duosnn

f77mc5a,t1_f77llzg,"Hehehe. Btw, they are aways here - even if your eyes are open, THEY can still be around... because you always rely on the fact that you know, what is on the other side of shower curtain, closed door, around the corner of your familiar flat...",t3_duosnn
f78xowu,t1_f78x89h,"I had problems sleeping as a kid, I would sleep walk all the time and get night terrors that would make me run around screaming about someones going to kill me if I don't do a certain task. One time I woke up in the middle of the night in the shower, shampoo being rinsed out of my hair. The water turning cold was what woke me up and as I slowly started to focus I could see shadows above the curtain rod of figures. It was scary as hell",t3_duosnn
