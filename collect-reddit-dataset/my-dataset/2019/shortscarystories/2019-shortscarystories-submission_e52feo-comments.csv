f9nc1z7,t1_f9klo66,Might make a little story about how they caught Benny and how he went to like a mental hospital or something. I'll see what I can do with it. He will get some help though. Eventually,t3_e52feo

Unfortunately, sequels, prequels, and serialized-posts are not allowed on this sub. Your best bet is to take it to r/nosleep, since series-stories seem to be widely accepted and encouraged there. ;w;”",t3_e52feo
