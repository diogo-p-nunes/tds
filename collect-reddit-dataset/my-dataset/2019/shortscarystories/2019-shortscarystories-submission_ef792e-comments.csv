fbzekek,t3_ef792e,"Wha...wha... what the fuck?

Seriously though, it's so messed up it's good. And i mean that in a complimentary way. It was also able to unease me in a very short amount of writing. Nice job!",t3_ef792e
fbyw8px,t3_ef792e,"unique, I like it",t3_ef792e
fbzwgsj,t3_ef792e,"Yeah, the gesture is kinda off-putting when they don't have much to clean yourself with at santa's workshop.

poor hygiene aside, it's been a while since i've seen a story that accomplishes so much with so little being said. quite honestly, it's been getting a little difficult to remember that this website is for short stories, and this is very refreshing to see. quality work.",t3_ef792e
fbz4hog,t3_ef792e,"Excellent. For such a short story, it had a hell of a twist! Enjoyed it!",t3_ef792e
fbzq273,t3_ef792e,quite a different one... Liked it....,t3_ef792e
fbzsqhv,t3_ef792e,"God this is so unsettling and screwed up. It's great. I had my husband read it and we talked about it for a while about how Santa got her, what maybe happened afterwards. It was a good short story and really fun to talk about the possinle after effect. I love the way you wrote it",t3_ef792e

fbzyf16,t3_ef792e,"Wow! Great story with a super twist at the end. It's hard to write this well in so few words. I find that with most short stories it's obvious from the outset where they're going, but this was a real surprise. Good stuff, thanks for posting!",t3_ef792e

fc0ke6g,t1_fc0i7a8,"Basically, the father said moms gone with Santa this year, but he really killed her and put her in a present box, and said maybe you'll get her back this year. And she did.. Just not in the way she thought",t3_ef792e

fbzcqms,t1_fbzcnk2,BAHAHAHAHAHSHH!,t3_ef792e
fc0zrax,t1_fc0d0sp,"Kids are unreliable narrators, so everything they say needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Dad killing mom and then lying to his kid makes the most sense here. Of course she would believe anything her dad says; she's a kid!

If this was told from the perspective of the father, then I would believe that ""Santa"" did it. But in that case, he'll think that it's some maniac dressed up as Santa, and dad would have called the cops ages ago.",t3_ef792e
fc0d215,t1_fc0d1bm,Right back at you. Merry Christmas,t3_ef792e
