hla5dnm,t1_hla46g8,"Great job! The audio is clear and clean sounding.
What mic do you use?
Although, I would suggest adding spooky background music and sound effects to the story's.
Most major horror readers do that so maybe by doing so it will cause more attraction to your channel and you'll gain more subscribers.
Also just subbed!ðŸ˜‰",t3_qxldpt
