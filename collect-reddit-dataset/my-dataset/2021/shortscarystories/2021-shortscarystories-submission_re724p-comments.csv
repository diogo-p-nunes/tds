hoadkm6,t1_ho879y3,Vanessa let a demonic entity take over her body!,t3_re724p
ho93vmo,t1_ho8iohz,"Well, tell them why, at least. Did you dislike the plot? Did you feel as though the writing didn’t flow, and that the author, like many others, could have made much better use of punctuation within their sentences? Did you have to reread the ending a couple times to figure it out, because it was written in a clumsy manner? Did you think that the story needed more clarification, more editing, another read-over, perhaps? It must be something quite serious to deserve a 1/10.",t3_re724p
hoadmvs,t1_hoadkm6,That's what I thought just wasn't sure 😃,t3_re724p
hoadvl8,t1_ho93vmo,I didn't even get to see the comment. Well...seems like the world will never know why the user didn't like it.😿,t3_re724p
hobivp7,t1_hoadvl8,"Guess so. Thought it was pretty good, myself - certainly not deserving of a 1/10, which was basically just what they said - something like “1/10 I guess”.",t3_re724p
hobmwbq,t1_hobivp7,"It wouldn't have been the first negative comment I've gotten on a story, and I'm sure it won't be the last, haha. Maybe it was one of those people that just go around downvoting stories just because. I've actually given them a name; I dubbed them downvote sharks. They swim in the murky waters of the ocean, seeking new stories they can crash and tear to shreds. 😹

At the very least, I'm happy someone thought it wasn't too bad!",t3_re724p
