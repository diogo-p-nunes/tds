hl89r3c,t3_qx8pax,I thought I was on r/holup thinking the husband cheating on you.,t3_qx8pax
hl9idzk,t3_qx8pax,"You should definitely stick around, but stand up for yourself! Let him know exactly how you feel about his attitude, and start nitpicking every little thing he does around the house.

You know, you should start following him around outside the house, too. No sense in staying put! Let him know his place!",t3_qx8pax
hlbvk07,t3_qx8pax,NTA. It’s just as much your home as it is his! Lol,t3_qx8pax
hlbsayw,t3_qx8pax,"NTA, make him buy more flowers, how inconsiderate can he be??",t3_qx8pax

hl8tzth,t1_hl7zcr8,God damn it I got got again,t3_qx8pax
hlbajle,t1_hl7zcr8,Haha sorry! 😅,t3_qx8pax
hl9zk9e,t1_hl7zcr8,"There has been an increasing number of people saying that. Unless someone hears the story, how is it possible to mess subs, it is written r/shortscarystories in bold, and  at least on my phone it is visible for the 2 and half paragraphs, and the story is 3 paragraphs!!",t3_qx8pax
hlbahmt,t1_hlb1e3d,That’s what I thought too,t3_qx8pax
hl9ualf,t1_hl9idzk,[deleted],t3_qx8pax
hl99rdj,t1_hl99eku,She's dead and her ghost is telling the story,t3_qx8pax
hlb9dr7,t1_hlb9ato,thank you!! Still debating if I should start writing more. 😅,t3_qx8pax
hlbdggk,t1_hl9zk9e,"Well it was in my feed, I wasn't in the actual subreddit. Not every phone shows Reddit the same way, either. Is it really that big of a deal that you had to make a ranting comment about it?",t3_qx8pax
hlc2ih2,t1_hl9zk9e,"Wow sorry to have been so stupid that I don’t read the sub of every post on my feed on my tiny iPhone 5 screen. 

It’s almost like there’s been an increasing number of very well-written AITA posts on the sub…",t3_qx8pax
hl9uufh,t1_hl9ualf,"Well, its definitely a comment more at home at /nosleep, where the stories are meant to be commented on as if they were real. 

Sometimes I comment on the quality of the story, sometimes I comment on the protagonists in the story.",t3_qx8pax
hl9tay0,t1_hl99rdj,"that and no, it isn't aita subreddit",t3_qx8pax
hlb4f55,t1_hl99rdj,Ohhhhh ok,t3_qx8pax
hlb9k1e,t1_hlb9dr7,"Yes please :) I love how you started with AITA, had me going!",t3_qx8pax
hlbq2fb,t1_hlbdggk,Yeah my phone hides it sometimes,t3_qx8pax
hldipm9,t1_hlbdggk,"It was enough to make me curious how it is possible to be so inattentive. I am on the phone too, and I see the sub reddit I am loud and clear ( sorry for the expression).",t3_qx8pax
hlb9ui0,t1_hlb9k1e,Well I can’t guarantee they’ll all be like that! But I’ll definitely start writing more. :),t3_qx8pax
hlbq8ow,t1_hlb9ui0,Yes write more!! Very good story 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,t3_qx8pax
