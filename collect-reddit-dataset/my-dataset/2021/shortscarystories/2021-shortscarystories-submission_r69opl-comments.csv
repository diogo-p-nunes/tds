hmshb7t,t3_r69opl,"Oh damn, that's nice!",t3_r69opl
hmt7cjf,t3_r69opl,This was so good OP! Though I felt the twist nearing the end it was set up and well deserved! Bravo!,t3_r69opl
hmtusgm,t3_r69opl,"After the first paragraph, I kind of guessed they were ghosts trying to stop her from becoming one of them. I hoped I was right because I absolutely LOVED this idea. I haven't read anything like this before. It might just be me but I often think about the ghosts of Jack the Ripper's victims roaming around London or The Yorkshire Ripper or any American serial killer. I imagine all the women to be badass friends in the afterlife who are torturing their murderers every day. 

Great job OP, best thing I have read for a while.",t3_r69opl
hmtuvsa,t3_r69opl,Oh! This was well written. Bravo. Did not expect that ending.,t3_r69opl

hmu6ieh,t3_r69opl,Great twist! And very well written story. Congrats!,t3_r69opl
hmsq837,t3_r69opl,"I'm going to agree with another commenter and say it was a surprise ending; not necessarily good or bad, just one I don't think we expected (hence, you know, a surprise).

Good story!",t3_r69opl
hmwisnp,t3_r69opl,I LOVE that the dog could feel effies presence. Love this story.,t3_r69opl
hmxps1a,t3_r69opl,"Oh, this is terrific... reminds me of the subplot in The Lovely Bones",t3_r69opl
hmvr857,t3_r69opl,Very promising.,t3_r69opl
hms1kiv,t1_hms0tx1,A good or bad surprise? I'll be honest I could have done with another 500 words. LOL,t3_r69opl
hmtvubq,t1_hmtusgm,"Thank you! Once I posted it, It got me to think of expanding it and writing a full story on it. There's so much more I want to explore with it.",t3_r69opl
hmti9ba,t1_hms1kiv,"That was a lovely story! Honestly I wouldn't say the ending was unexpected. There were various hints.

I was thinking if they are following her, why doesn't Sarah look behind and notice them on her tail, not even once? Later even, as the rubbish bin is shaken, the dog is kicked etc., these are all the instances where they could attract her attention, but Sarah doesn't detect them as if blind to their presence. Suspected that they might be undetectable because they are ghosts as the twist, trying to scare Sarah away from continuing on the path she is confidently strolling on because something bad would happen. Especially since in the first paragraph it's hinted that Sarah is ""his"" next victim, making it seem like the creeps following her are actually out to protect her.

Maybe I'm just paranoid lol but I think the build up of this story was well done, and all the suspicious, subtle details added up in the end.",t3_r69opl
hmvx3bi,t1_hms1kiv,"It was a brilliant, great surprise, and maybe I’m as oblivious as Sarah, but I wasn’t expecting any of that.  Great twist.  No need to use any more words than u did. Your point was made and I was wowed!",t3_r69opl
hmsqas2,t1_hms1kiv,"Hmm, neither good nor bad, just an unexpected turn! Good story!",t3_r69opl
