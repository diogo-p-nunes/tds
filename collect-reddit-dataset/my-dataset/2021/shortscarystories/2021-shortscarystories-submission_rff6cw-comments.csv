**HYPERâ€™S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#5:** Bossk - Migration

**Genre:** Post-Metal

Atmospheric is the one word that comes to mind when Iâ€™m trying to describe this album. It feels like youâ€™re on a journey - a bleak and ominous journey, but a journey nonetheless. For me, the sonic landscape of Migration is sort of like an audio-version of liminal space aesthetic, and itâ€™s kinda like youâ€™re wandering the post-apocalyptic desolates.

A true masterpiece!  

I actually wrote three stories for this album, but the first two were a bit too ambitious (but Iâ€™d like to finish them in the future regardless - stay tuned!), so instead I landed on this one; a more grim and direct approach to the album title.

Also, for an alternate ending, you can choose not to read the spoiler, making for a sadder, more real and raw version maybe?

**Favorite Track:** Lira

**Album Rating:** 9.9/10 Menhirs",t3_rff6cw

hodo2wq,t3_rff6cw,Beautifully written,t3_rff6cw
hofot8y,t3_rff6cw,"This is really just sad :( as someone with a dead brother and lover I've had dreams of the former reaching out to me in my dreams, only to have his arm fall off when I go to hold it. That dream really messed me up for a long time. I like this story though, makes me wonder if it'd be worth it to see him again, even if he was a rotting corpse... \*realizes he is a rotting corpse anyway\*... gotta go cry now.",t3_rff6cw

hofrwms,t3_rff6cw,I read this with the voice of Sir David Attenborough in my head. Beautiful and freaky all at the same time :),t3_rff6cw
hogymz6,t3_rff6cw,"So either this is literal, with the dead actually crawling out of their graves, or the whole idea of this â€˜migrationâ€™ is just a story the mom made up to justify reuniting with her rotting son. Or this is some kind of justification for everyone to reunite with their dead relatives.

Wow this is really well written wow. I absolutely love the imagery and the haunting idea. Youâ€™re one if the best writers in this sub",t3_rff6cw
