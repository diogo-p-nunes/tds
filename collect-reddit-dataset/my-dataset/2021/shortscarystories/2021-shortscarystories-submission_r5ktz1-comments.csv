hmobql3,t3_r5ktz1,"Hi, OP! For the rusted bits, I recommend getting some WD-40 and wire brushes to clean off any rust or corrosion. You can also pick up assorted nuts, bolts, and screws at your local hardware store.  


When turning resistant bolts, it's sometimes helpful to use a length of pipe as a ""breaker bar"" to extend the handle of your wrench.   


If you can make some minor repairs/upgrades it may show your husband that you are trying to be frugal, but that functionality is important. Good luck!",t3_r5ktz1
