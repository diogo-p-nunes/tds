I traveled all over the world until I found what I was looking for, the Guerta catacombs, it was in Rome, a secret catacomb with only a few people knowing its location, I was going to make a documentary about it and so I had decided to find it a long time ago .

I broke the rules a little to be able to enter, climbed the iron gate and penetrated into the catacombs, for some reason entry into these catacombs was forbidden but I would not submit to such laws. 

When I entered I could admire the splendor of the catacomb, it had wide arcades that created a cobweb with narrow branches, full of tombs dug into the floor and somewhere a burial niche. 

In addition, the narrow galleries often starting from an older basement complex, form a dense grate, above which there would be two, three, or four floors that communicate with each other with narrow sloping levels. As I proceeded to the catacomb I saw that inside the walls were carved narrow horizontal tombs sealed with tiled or marble slabs. 

next to me there was a dark gallery and on the floor I could see a sign that said ""do not approach"", this aroused my curiosity and I decided to enter that gallery. As the gallery became more and more wet and dark , at one point I could not see anything and so I decided to go back. Suddenly I felt something hitting me in the head and I fell down on the floor unconscious. 

When I woke up I could see that I was tied with a rope to a wooden table in a polygonal room with two people wearing a plague doctor mask. There were painted pentacles on the walls and that made me realize the scary reality that I was going to experience. 

One of the two people with a plague doctor mask took a scalpel out of his pocket while the other one was holding an axe in his hand as they were both coming closer and closer to me ..."
raw3y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/raw3y2/the_catalyst/,The Catalyst,16,2,1638872631.0,"I’ve had access to the means of committing suicide my whole life. Why I didn’t act on those urges before, I can’t tell you. Maybe I was afraid to die, maybe I was afraid of how much it will hurt, or what lies beyond when we inevitably die.

I’ve attempted before, been having depression and anxiety-like symptoms my whole life. My parents like to act like it never happened. They are religious, they believed that if you would simply pray it would go away. I wish it was that simple for me. I have lived my whole life guilt ridden, believing that I would go to hell if I slipped up. I never opened up to my parents, I already knew the religious rhetoric they would use to dismiss my emotions. *I felt like I was losing myself*

I walked out of my house and up to a bridge that overlooked a relatively busy road. There were only a few cars that zoomed by however, with headlights piercing through the darkness. The thought of jumping rose into my heart as did my stomach when looking down at the distance. *You don’t desire death.* I turned around, there was nobody there. I gulped slowly and turned back around, it was just in my head. *Your Mind and I are the Same.* I laughed, I can’t believe me going insane was going to be added to the list of things wrong with me. *Shall I reveal myself to you?* I blinked and saw a flash of red next to me, I backed away slowly, still couldn’t believe that this was happening. I opened my eyes and I was struck. A figure with large, milk white wings, feathers that glistened in the moonlight. A tall being with nothing but a mouth and pearls wrapped around its torso. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve laid my eyes upon. *Be Afraid.* It had said in a deep reverent tone that shook me to my core. I stood in awe.  *I choose you, son of suffering, son of sin, be reborn.*  I walked home. Took the bread knife that I had just used to cut a bagel this morning. *T*h*E* H*O*u*S*e F*e*l*l* S*i*le*n*t. The being cried tears of blood. I too wished to cry tears of blood.I walked slowly to the bathroom mirror, looking at the reflection of myself. Covered in blood, *was this the person I wanted to be?*  The being wrapped its wings around me. The feathers stung me when it contacted my skin. I felt myself rise to the sky, I looked down and saw a lifeless body of a husk that I couldn’t recognize. I was simply..... alive.

*My parents once told me that my mental issues were simply the work of the devil*

*Nothing More.*"
rate98,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rate98/still_life/,Still Life,101,5,1638861344.0,"My husband left me a year ago—devastated me. Disappeared without a trace. I even called the police—they never found a scrap of him. Finally, they gave up looking—chalked it up to a man grown weary of living with an eccentric woman.

I took up painting as a way to cope with the loss, and turns out I’m pretty good. I had a teacher for a short while, but she told me early on that I had a natural flair, and that I was wasting both my time and money on her.

I eventually opened a little gallery where I sell my work and that of a few others in town who share my inclinations toward the macabre. The piece I’m just finishing now is of my husband lying naked on a thick plastic drop cloth draped across our bed, his hands and feet tied to the bedposts, his throat slit in a deep, straight line from ear to ear, blood cascading down his neck and onto his chest and shoulders. I call the piece *How a Husband Leaves His Wife*.

Looking at it now, I think I might’ve gone a little overboard with the drama, might’ve tapped into my anger a little too deeply—the fear in his eyes, his mouth frozen in an eternal gasp. I think I might’ve been remembering the times he hit me when I painted his expression—but I *never* hit him. *Never*. Not *ever*. I loved him.

*Oh well* . . .

As good a painter as people say I am, the thing that confounds me most is why—say, like a good writer can—I can’t create a vision for a painting in my imagination. I have to paint from life . . . or a photograph. I guess we all have our limits."

“Closing up now, honey,” he says.

Leah, at home on the couch, twirls the phone cord nervously.

“Hurry up, won’t ya? That killer is still running around.”

“Whoever it is should know better than to mess with you.”

“Funny. Just be safe. I love you.”

“Love you, too.”

Leah, afraid of the silence, turns on the television.

“Special report: The Moonlight Killer. Who is he? What does he want? And who’s next?”

Jamie climbs in his pick up and lights a smoke. Leah hates when he smokes, so he savors it. Sitting there, he notices the flood light in the back is still on. But he shut that off. Didn’t he?

Leah puts Jamie’s dinner in the oven. He’s always so grumpy when he’s hungry… And since he quit smoking. But that was for his own - 

A knock at the door. At this hour? Maybe Jamie forgot his key. 

The television again: “We have with us tonight Dr. Linda Harvey, criminologist. Dr. Harvey, what exactly do you make of these gruesome murders?”

Another knock at the door. Linda eyes a knife at the edge of the counter.

“Thank you for having me. What’s interesting here is that the killings are so similar, the method so specific, yet the sheer number impossible for any one person.”

Jamie shuts the light off, but something’s wrong. 

Gripping the knife, Leah peers through the curtains. But it’s dark, only the moon offering illumination. 

“Are you suggesting there is more than one Moonlight Killer?”

A hand grabs his neck and forces Jamie to the ground, extinguishing his cigarette.

“With the number of deaths in so many locations, there may be upwards of thirty killers.”

Then she sees it: a hooded figure. Leah gasps, and the figure turns toward her.

“That sure is a terrifying story, Doctor. But isn’t that a little far fetched?”

A hooded man has Jamie by the throat. Another walks toward him wielding an axe.

“Well, I would say thirty-seven decapitations over the course of two weeks is a little far fetched, too.”

Leah screams as the man kicks down the door and runs at her with an axe. She dodges him and his axe gets lodged in the good furniture. 

Jamie hears the axe dragging on the concrete. He grabs the hands of the man strangling him, grips his pinkies and snaps them.

“And what do you suggest our viewers do to protect themselves?”

Leah sees the man struggling with the axe. Still screaming, she plunges the knife into his neck. 

The man howls and releases his grip. The other raises the axe but Jamie kicks him hard in the gut. He goes down. 

“Everyone should stay inside…”

Leah watches the blood spurt like a fountain.

“…and under no circumstances…”

Jamie takes the axe and hacks into him. The other tries to crawl away but Jamie grabs his ankle and pulls him back, his nails ripping against the concrete. 

“…attempt anything heroic.”"

After awhile, the purr and gentle meow of our cat by our side causes us to give them a scratch and pet, without even thinking about it. We do this while watching TV, while engrossed in our newest novel, during that 1 hour gab session with our best friend.

A whine and a bit of a snort, and we raise obediently from our couch and the latest mobile game to let the dog out.

At night, in our dreams, we gently hug our big dog, a scratch to the ears, a gentle sweep down the side.

Some of us, closer to our pets perhaps than others (or less afraid of hair and dirt) lift a corner of the blanket for our furry friends. We operate on sight and sound, a gentle brush of fur or soft whine or purr.

Rex was none of those. A gentle scratch on the covers, and up goes a corner for sleepy snuggles. I relished in this nightly trend.

A sense of calm surrounded me, and the warmth seeped into my bones as I would deeply breathe.

Tonight, I heard and felt the ""scratch scratch"". Half awake, I raised the covers. A fuzzy form lumbered in. 

The usual warmth felt off somehow tonight. 

The sigh of contentment died on my lips.

Every kid and adult alike will be soaking up the festive season. But there was a time back in 1984 when the festive season should have been called the frightful season. 

We are still not sure how it happened. There was a new toy set to be all the rage being manufactured in the elf factory. A beacon of brilliance. A toy to top all other toys. A masterpiece in engineering. It was a speaking, interactive doll. 

To say we hit big wouldn't be right. Thousands of these toys were earmarked and shipped out to eager children. The trees were full that year. Homes were merry and joyous. Everything changed Christmas morning. 

We don't know who programmed the dolls with a secret message. It wasn't a glitch. We know that much. 

A few hundred children upon opening and playing with the toy didn't find the hidden message. Call it dumb luck. 

A smattering of the most fortunate ceased playing with the dolls. In fact, they cease to do anything. They didn't respond to their names. Didn't bother to move anymore. Didn't converse or even move unless propelled. 

A couple of thousand found the message and went into a blind panic. They ripped anything they could find apart. Their sibling's presents. Their pets. Even their siblings. 

A few thousand got it bad. One minute they were playing. The next they were lights out. Gone. Hit the floor, bye bye, dead. 

But the last group of poor souls got it bad. Something about the message triggered them into a murderous rage. Thousand upon thousands of children worldwide went on a murder spree. 

They killed their families without remorse, taking the time to arrange their dead bodies like Christmas stars. No matter how they died or where in the world the grievous act was committed, parents, siblings, grandma and grandad's were placed around the tree, arms and legs spread to the world. 

Our factory descended into madness. Only one among us could have done it. Only an elf could produce such a devastating doll. While the world tried to understand what had happened, Santa tried to find the culprit. But he didn't.  

That St Stevens night the elf's had a hard time retrieving all the dolls. But, contrary to what you may think, only a handful of dolls were taken as evidence and only one was missing completely. Where that doll went is anyone's guess. 

Well, not everyone. I have the last doll. A token if you will. A message for you humans and a calling to my elven family. 

I thought I was quite a genius coming up with it. With a little sprinkle of magic to aid the effects. 

θα βάψεις τα σπίτια σου κόκκινα, άκου το κάλεσμά μου. κάνε ένα δώρο στον Άγιο Βασίλη, σκότωσε τους όλους.

This Christmas I have another toy ready to sit in glittery paper under your trees. One that will dwarf my last masterpiece."
rakxqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rakxqs/better/,Better,364,17,1638833511.0,"What would you do if you could wish for anything?

The wishes came from a half used matchbook in an abandoned mall. ""Strike the match and speak your wish aloud"" was printed on its outside in ornate gold script. Amused, I did so.

""I wish I had a cigarette.""

It was in my other hand as soon as I finished speaking and I dropped the match on the floor out of fright. My second wish was for ten thousand dollars. I cursed myself as soon as I'd said it, I could have asked for millions, billions even. 

One match left. I took a drag from the cigarette and cleared my mind. The answer was suddenly obvious.

""I wish Molly was better.""

If you'd known her you'd have done the same. She was smart and funny too, albeit with a dark sense of humour. She was also dying.

I came home and found all the cash stowed behind the broken wardrobe panel with other things I hid away. Molly told us about her mysterious recovery to us two weeks later and for a short stint of our lives, life was good.

Molly had never been a good student but a week after her health returned, her grades shot up. She beat half the track team in gym class. More annoyingly to us, she became more *moral*. Molly was probably technically becoming more of a good person but none of us were good people back then. Maybe we'd have grown out of it, maybe we were just a product of our shithole of a town.

I was barely 17 when the misfortunes started happening. They weren't all deaths at first and you'd have had to have really known Molly to know they were linked to her. The jock who tried to grope her broke his leg, the stoner she hated got sick, the teacher who refused to be her academic reference died of a heart attack.

The real tragedy struck three years later. My whole town was scrubbed off the map in under an hour. I drove home at breakneck pace even though the news said survivors were 'unlikely.'

I searched through the destruction, trying to find the rubble that had once been my parents' house. Then I saw Molly, wandering through it all without a care in the world.

""This was you."" I said, unsure of how I knew but certain nonetheless.

""Yes. This place was broken. It needed to go."" Molly said.

""My friends... family... god Molly, even your family. Am I next, is that it?""

She shook her head softly.

""I'm not sure I can. Simon told me what you did, the wish you made about me. Ending you might reverse it. Tell me though, what did you wish exactly?""

""I just wished you'd get better."" I said through clenched teeth.

Molly chuckled.

""Well, I am that. Better than I was. Better than you.""

Her feet left the ground and she rose effortlessly.

""Better than human."""

We didn’t hear the rumors until after we’d moved in. But who believes in ghosts? Especially when you can get a house for half its worth?

Then my wife woke me in the middle of the night, her voice frantic as she whispered, “Do you hear that?”

I did. A rustling in the walls. It came and went, never staying long enough for us to figure out what its source.

Then came the smell.

A musk, with undertones of rot. At first, we thought we had mold, but there were no signs of leaks. Just the occasional wet trail in the bathroom, but never enough to cause concern.

It wasn’t until the sinkhole that we realized what we’d been living on.

The hole swallowed our entire living room. As we looked down into the gaping crater where we used to watch TV, we saw them.

Snakes. Thousands of snakes. Writhing like a single living thing. The exterminator said they must’ve been under the house for years. Growing and breeding. Moving through the plumbing.

rabkkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/rabkkl/ryan_and_the_sunflowers/,RYAN AND THE SUNFLOWERS,59,4,1638809042.0,"  

Ryan hadn’t quite realised his deep horror of sunflowers until the damn things became trendy on Instagram and Kelly started insisting that they visit a local sunflower farm for selfies. 

After all, it is quite easy to go through life avoiding sunflowers. Ryan had childhood memories of them, wilting and musty at his mother’s funeral. Later he remembered a batch growing wild on a patch of earth close to school. They were so tall, their brown speckled heads nodding in the blinding sunlight, birds flapping around them and those ugly yellow petals. 

Ryan hated them, hated walking by them and was relieved when they moved to a sunflower-free place. Then, he was able to forget the plant monsters, and even his nightmares of them, brown and yellow, flapping and nodding, faded. 

Until now. Kelly was obsessed with social media. Ryan didn’t mind and even started enjoying it, arranging his sushi on the plate just so before eating, stopping every so often for those all-important couple selfies, and joining her in reading comments and comparing the number of likes on different photos.

But this was different. He didn’t even know at first why he kept finding excuses not to visit the sunflower farm, until one day in early fall, Kelly said she’d planned it, they were going this Saturday as it would be the last weekend of the season that the farm was open to the public. She said it in a tone that brooked no disagreement, and instantly Ryan’s childhood horror awakened, as intensely sharp as when he had to walk by them twice a day, trying to avoid the sight of their beastly speckled seed-filled heads and flapping large petals. 

Saturday morning arrived too soon. Kelly looked stunning in a bright blue dress, and she fussed with Ryan’s matching lighter blue casual-looking t-shirt. “Blue will pop against the background, see sweetie?” and she showed her screen displaying millions of pictures of grinning fools against the malign creatures. 

Ryan shuddered and turned away. As they drove closer to the farm, his misery grew deeper, the blobs of browny-yellow against the dark green shone brighter and their haunting terrible smell hung in the crisp fall air. 

The crowd was unbelievable- clearly they were not the only ones hoping to catch the last sunflower pics of the season. The happy farmer took their cash and ushered them towards the field. Ryan felt he was suffocating. Kelly’s voice came from a distance- “here? What do you think sweetheart?”

The laughing chattering crowd seemed to pull him away from her and deeper into the mass of sunflowers. He glimpsed Kelly, arranging her sunhat and skirt. Then she vanished from sight. The crowd melted. Ryan was alone, surrounded by the sunflowers, their seeded dark heads towering over him, leaning down closer. 

Their petals brushed against his skin. 

He sank to the earth screaming hysterically, the plants bent over him, covering him with green leaves and yellow petals and he knew nothing more."

I use to enjoy secretly going up to people who are dead, but are fully enjoying themselves being dead, and I would bring them back into the world where they will have to work again, pay bills and experience other uncomfortable feelings. I saw a dead person on the ground and he was smiling and the knife stabbed into his chest was what was keeping him dead. He looked so peaceful like he had finally found peace and that nothing could bother him. 

I snuck up on the dead body but the dead body rose on its feet. The body had an automatic mechanism which will stand up and fight anyone who tried to pull the knife out of him. I fought the body and pulled the knife out and the man was now back in life. He begged me to stab him again and I sadistically said ""no"" and he cried some more. I threw away the knife and I told him while laughing ""now that I have forced you back into the world you now have to work, pay bills, meet people you don't want to meet and do things you don't want to do"" and I walked away. 

The reason I enjoyed doing this was because somebody else did it to me. I was happily dead but some punk pulled out the axe from my head. After doing this hobby for a while somebody had spotted me and asked me if I could do it to a dead person they knew, but for money. It was illegal to force happily dead people back into life. From then on I only started forcibly bringing back happy dead people from the living people that paid me. Like I said it's not as simple as pulling out the knife or bullet because at first you would have to fight the body which has an automatic response to fight back. 

On my last job I was paid to pull out a sword from a happy dead guy. The person who paid me was jealous that this guy got to escape the rat race and had evil intentions towards the happy dead guy. It's a selfish game. As I went towards the dead body to pull out the sword, the body like a robot jumped up to its feet and formed wings. It tried to fly away but I held it down and pulled out the sword, and the dead guy was back in life. 

He cried and cried to be stabbed back but I didn't do it. I miss doing it all for fun to happy dead people that I wanted to do it to. Now I have to listen to the people paying me, I have to do it on their time table and I miss doing it for fun instead of responsibility. Too late now."

Trade with the neighbouring villages was difficult, almost impossible during the long, cold winters. If the crops were bad, then the people would starve. 

Centuries before, out of desperation and neccessity, they had forged the deal. The May Snow would come, but it required an offering.

Since the early age of the village, the Giving-Tree stood tall in the square. Grotesque giant limbs sticking out at unatural angles, sending thin spidery like branches in every possible direction. The leafs, like the rest of the tree, were of pure white.

When the first of May hit, the whole town put itself to work. They all had to do their part. The farmers ploughed the fields and set the seeds, the others dug the small hole at the base of the Tree.

Two weeks later when the fields were ready, they gathered in the silent darkness at the Giving-Tree. It was always the first born of the year, there was no discrimination on status. The blood pouring from its cuts was carefully collected. Once the small innocent body was buried, the blood was poured in a circle around the base. No words needed be spoken. Beginning at the roots, they could see the red making its way up the dead white of it. It was time to go home before it came.

Once the animals where shut in and everyone in the town was safely back at home, they prayed. They did their best to shut out the baleful crying emanating from the Giving-Tree, echoing loud and terrible across the village. 

And so the May Snow began to fall. It silently powdered the roofs and emtpy streets in the black of night. Most importantly it fell thickly upon the fields, fertilizing that years seeds with its nourishing content. This year the crops would be good. They had done what they must.

The May Snow would now fall relentlessly for three days. Always the same deep crimson red color."

She rode that sympathetic tide, her quietly buoyant spirit unmarred by the half-dozen faint scars that crossed her wrists. Whenever she’d tuck her hair behind her ear, I couldn’t help but flinch at those scarcely keloid deceptions. Scars worn like costume jewelry. 

Maria was a con-artist, a fucking fraud, and I knew her little white lies long before the malignancy of the ruse blackened my heart to the snake oil on her cheeks.

She had a pretty way, and there was a time when that made me love her. And I did love her. I did. But I buried the care that fed that love whenever a bath went too long. The threat became a taxing preoccupation. And when she cried, my rescuer’s run became slower and slower. Eventually, I started stepping backwards. 

Maria was a con-artist. A masterful one. 

But the lie was the smile. 

‘Calloused becomes the heart that ever bleeds for another,’ she had written in the note. She knew what I felt and as I wrapped myself in distance, she just kept smiling—pretending to be the person I had met before a blue existence turned the bath water red. 

The note was written in an even hand, crisp white paper creased and folded and left beneath a soap dish. It concluded, ‘the act became the act.  One killed, the other laid to rest.’

As I set it down, the paper’s edge bit into my skin. A sting. A languid welling of blood. I sucked the wound and forgave her for leaving. *I* forgave *her*.

A bill cut me next, not a day later. Then a menu, a receipt, a windswept flyer. Each drew blood. It washed away, but the open wounds remained. The pain nagged as my hands fell idle, as I began to dread the rustle of the letterbox and packaging for frozen pizza. 

It was a week before I noticed the swelling redness of infection. A fever followed and a nurse at the clinic rolled her eyes. 

“It’s a paper cut—I think you’ll live. Take two of these and remember to wash your hands *thoroughly.*”

I smiled, trying not to wince. “Thanks.”

The fever fell, but in time, it returned. The pain grew and my friends looked on with concern, then pity, then indifference. 

“I keep getting paper cuts...”

What tears do we shed for a wound so trivial? What effort do we offer when a cry for help can be muted with a bandage?

So I screamed beneath a smiling mask—my threadbare offering to those few people who stayed for the unbearable lie. But I was never truly alone. 

I had Maria. 

As I suffered, her memory remained. I understood her. I had become her pain. 

And I kept her note. It was a reminder of the first cut, but it was also a reminder of her. Sweet words folded into a crisp blade."

It has been very tense in the house lately and he keeps refusing to talk to me about anything baby related. He just stays in the garage working on his lawnmower and other equipment. 

I have been really exhausted lately as my due date is really close. John surprised me with a romantic meal and it was the happiest I had been in months. I felt my eyes beginning to droop during the meal and I saw an evil glint in his eyes just before I passed out.

I don't know how long I was unconscious but I awoke to find myself hanging naked in the garage. John was watching me and smiling. I begged him to let me down but he just kept smiling. 

He placed the lawnmower under me with the blades facing upwards and then started the engine. I let out a scream of agony as my son was born and was then forced to watch as his body was ripped apart by the blades"

Before I could fully get my senses straight, a hand covered my mouth and told me to be silent. My eyes darted to my friend Rhian, whose slumber seemed eternal. 

I wasn't sure if it was my fear that made the room so deadly quite or that the noises feared him. 

All the fight that I knew I could muster just went non-existent, like I was under a spell, like a marionette whose strings weren't being pulled. 

The way my heart raced felt like a bomb was about to go off my chest which only ticked faster when a blindfold was tied on my head as he placed me in the backseat of a car. 

I could've screamed bloody murder by then but I was such in a state of disbelief that my mind still couldn't process what was happening. 

The drive felt like a lifetime, every turn convinced me that I would soon meet death and when he finally stopped and took me out of the vehicle, the sight that greeted me when he took the cover off almost made me lose my mind. 

There I was at the early hours of the morning standing in front of my home as the sound of a car driving off faded slowly in the background. 

The strong brush of the wind couldn't rival the way I screamed at that. 

A scream that turned into a screech that woke my parents and neighbors up. A sound that showed how horror was wrecking my body as it trembled and made tears fall as my mom wore panic and worry, trying to calm me down while dad called 9-1-1.

It took the morning light before the authorities could get a word out of me. 

Questions were asked over and over but what I couldn't answer was the one about what he looked like.

I wasn't sure if it was because I was too scared at that moment because all I remember seeing was that he had no face. Maybe he had one and I just couldn't accept that it was the face of a person that would bring my demise.

The investigation also revealed that there had been no sign of a break-in at Rhian's house and it couldn't be her father coz he had already been dead for five years. Different angles had been taken and not one yielded any result.

The case's trail went cold as it had been fifteen years and he...it...still hasn't been caught. Fifteen years of therapy, of checking the bolts on every door of the house three times a day, and fifteen years of this waking nightmare.

I never saw Rhian after that despite her seeking me out. Im sorry, old friend. I hope to wake from this sleep soon."

“*I know I’m probably the last person you’d expect to call, and probably beyond the last person you’d want to talk to—so I’ll be quick*.”

“So, Sam, you know why you are here?”  
“I… I think so.”  
“I want you to tell me why you think you’re here.”

“Because people think I killed those kids.”  
“Wouldn’t you know it, but that’s right.”

“Listen, Mr. McLowen… or, is it detective?”  
“Officer. But I’ll let it slide.”

“Of course you didn’t. No one ever does. We’ve always got the wrong guy. Even the right guy is the wrong guy.”  
“I swear I didn’t do it.”

“An eyewitness account.”

“Of what?”  
“The murder.”  
“Do tell.”  
I swallowed.  
“It was Thursday night. My house is set right on the edge of this big field. Behind that is a forest. I was sitting on my deck, looking out at the stars, and I saw this glow through the trees.”  
“A glow?”  
“Yessir. A glow. I was intrigued, so I went towards it. I followed it. I went past the field, into the forest. The glow was farther away than I thought. A lot farther. I must’ve walked for thirty minutes.”  
“The crime scene was four miles away from your residence.”  
“See? But, I digress, I get to the glow, and it’s from a fire. Surrounding the fire are these tents. And out from the tents come these… people.”  
“Describe them.”  
“That would be hard.”

“What gender?”  
“I can’t tell you. I couldn’t make enough out. They all got down on their knees and they started to chant. Out from the dark of the forest, the side opposite me, there came another figure, leading those children towards that fire. They were all tied up. They all stood up, in turn, in front of those people. And then… they were pushed into the fire. And the people kneeled down by the fire, and they chanted louder and louder. I turned away, it was too horrible, and when I looked back, it was gone. Those bodies were lying at my feet. Another man came out from the trees and saw me and just started screaming.”  
McLowen shook his head. 

“Listen, son. I don’t know what you’re on but that isn’t going to go past me or a judge and certainly not a jury.”  
“But…”  
“No. This isn’t a game. This isn’t a horror movie. This isn’t a short scary story. You tell me of a… a… coven of witches. I didn’t do it, they did.”  
“But it’s true.”

Other than the occasional painful step on a lego I got to his room pretty fast and saw him standing up in his crib.

He was way more upset than I had ever seen him before, he looked scared. Terrified even.

There had been storms before and he had never reacted like this before.

Then I saw him... During the brief moment a lightningstrike lit up the room I saw the outline of a man hiding behind the drapes.

My heart immediately started beating faster... Will he attack me? Does he know I've spotted him?

No, if he knew he would have attacked me already. I picked Ayden up as calmly as I could and started talking to him as I would normally.

*Aww, did the lightning scare you little guy? Come on, you can sleep with me and mommy tonight.*

I started walking out the door back to the master bedroom and that's when I heard the drapes being pulled to the side and he spoke with a raspy voice...

*Did you see me? Well, it doesn't matter now...*

An autopsy confirmed he had done this to himself. A well liked and easy going professor, he gave no indication of suicide ideation before he killed himself and everyone was taken aback when the news spread of the brutality of his death. He had set himself on fire after dousing himself in petrol, but also slashed his wrists. 

It was almost as though he had to make extra sure he wasn’t going to survive even if he changed his mind. 

The strangest thing of all was that he didn’t leave a note, not even to his wife who, by all accounts, was the love of his life.

For years, the story of his suicide was a town mystery. An urban legend passed down between the students at the university. Everyone had a theory. Some said he had found out his wife was having an affair. Some said one day he just snapped. Someone even suggested that the professor was hiding a dark secret. 

And those people were perhaps closer to the truth than they realise. 

You see, three years after his death, Professor Warren Thomas Andrews’ final note was published in the main town newspaper anonymously yesterday. 

Its contents are the reason there is currently a spate of suicides, crime and chaos erupting across the country.

“For years, I have thought that the placement of the stars is not random, that it is a message. I mentioned it once, and my peers laughed at me, so secretly I began to decipher the message I thought was there.

Yesterday, two decades of research later I have learned I am right. There is a message in our night sky every night. It has been the same for all eternity. I wish I had never tried to learn what it said.

Forgive me. I cannot keep living with the knowledge of what I have found and what I know it will unleash into the world.

I am leaving you with a translation of the exact words.

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where a man is hanging because he murdered three; Strange things happen here, you will see, but stranger still is he murdered me.* 

The kids sang that rhyme. When I walked to the tree or the gallows. An enigma in a mask. A phantom who came and took. Time had blurred the memory of the count. One hundred. Two. Five. A thousand. Only those who harvest the souls truly know. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where the dead man gurgles out to be free; they say he hangs because he killed three, so stay your hand or it will be thee.*

I see them hanging everywhere now. In the branches of the forest. From every lamp post down the street. Swinging in the breeze. Gazes fixed in accusing stares. The heavy weight loads my shoulders. But the conviction isn't mine. I am the bullet to the ones who pulled the trigger. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Wear your necklace of hope, side by side with me; They say he murdered more than three, and at the drop we will be free.*

I walk now to the trees. A noose swings gently from a strong branch. The last leaf falls. The amber ground crunches under my boot. The man's throat bobs with guilt. The tree is tall. The rope is thick. Another soul will die out tonight. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where the strung up a man, they say murdered three. Rumour says it was he, who hung the man who murdered three.*

The song knows the truth. Those that had false accusations against them. Those that hung under my hands for crimes they didn't commit. But they see me. They know. They are there, hanging in the breeze. Eyes popped open. Lips purple with the kiss of truth. They know. And so do I. 

*Are you coming to the hanging tree? Where they hang the man who murdered thee. Strange things happen, you will see, as he hangs and cries and begs and pleads.*

The noose fits perfectly around my throat. Four inches thick. One for every hundred I've killed. Sure, I didn't condemn them but I pulled the switch, hoisted the rope. I see them hanging. The ones I've murdered. I see them everywhere. There's no escaping them. But I will follow. 

For I will go down to the hanging tree. Where strange things happen, I have seen; I'll string up the man who murdered thee, and then, just than, we might be free."

""Fill them with love""

Those were my mother's last words to me. This woman who neglected me my whole life spoke those words as if they were her only regret. The phrase left her lips as her eyes studied my kids through the window of her room, each of them having a conversation while waiting in the hospice hallway. Then she passed away of the very preventable disease. I blamed myself, of course. When I broke the news to my children, their tears broke my heart. It was then that I decided to honor her words in everyway that I could. 

""Can I have 5$ for the book fair, mom?"" My youngest boy asked sweetly. 

I told him yes and slipped the extra 25$ in his bulging lunch sack. Each of their meals entailed an apple, a orange, 3 cheese sticks, a jello, a pudding, 4 juice boxes, and 2 stuffed ham sandwiches. On top of the large buffet sat notes that read the motto I'd adopted. 
""Filled with love"" 

When my twin daughter's birthdays came around it was the same thing. There was 5 cakes, each with 4 tiers. In total they were allowed to invite 50 friends, 70 came and we were the talk of the town for awhile. 5th graders don't often have parties with an entire bounce house mansion. The debt was worth it. Many of our guest got ill from eating too much ice cream. I told all of the parents the same thing. 
""They're filled with love""

Shortly after that my babies wanted a dog. You should have seen their faces when I came home with the whole pound. We didn't feel the need to cage any of them. They were family after all. A few of the animals weren't the best house guests but I was always sure to fill them with love. 

When flu season came, as it always does, two out of three caught a bug and the other soon followed. None of them were able to attend school while the house was filled with the sounds of coughing. I knew just what to do. The woman at the drug store gave me a strange look but I figured she never heard my mother's last words. After a few boxes of pills and bottles of syrup, they each took a very restful nap while my entire house filled with love."

The local dance studio allows me to attend their dance lessons out of charity because it was well publicized that my mom died in a car accident last year.

We are performing the Nutcracker Ballet this afternoon and I am really hoping that my dad shows up.

As the performance starts, I can’t see out in the audience because of all the bright lights in my face.

After the performance was over all the family members met with their kids outside in the hallway of the theater, where all of the kid performers were getting hugs and flowers.

As I got to the end of the hallway, I realized that my father didn’t show up.

I couldn’t stop crying which made me feel more embarrassed.

As all of the family members were driving away from the theater, I got on my bike and pedaled away, where all of the cars were looking at me as I rode by.

Things got even worse when I got to my housing development, where the eighth grade girls from school were huddled together in the street.  They started calling me the worst names because I still had my Nutcracker outfit on.

They make fun of me every day but today made me feel even worse, because I felt so alone after nobody came to my recital.

I walked past my father’s bedroom, where I figured that he was still sleeping from being drunk from the night before.

I cried in my room in the dark with my recital outfit still on for a long time.

After a while, my dad came into my room and said “I’m so so sorry for missing your recital. Please come out to the living room for a minute.”

I walk to the living room and we both look out the window.

My dad then says “I want you to take a look at that girl who is riding that bike down the street.”

I see that she has cut up jeans on, like most eighth grade girls do, but there is something really different about her, where I’m not sure if she’s 13 or 30.  She kind of looks like a Gremlin or something.

As she gets close to the girls who harass me each and every day, she gets off her bike, then throws the bike to the ground, where the closest girl to her is Kimberly, who treats me the worst.

The Gremlin looking girl walks up to Kimberly and grabs her by the hair and repeatedly punches her in the face, where there’s so much blood pouring out of Kimberly’s nose.

As Kimberly is hysterically crying on the ground, she methodically hunts down each of the other girls and beats them to a pulp, then the Gremlin looking girl gets on her bike and waves to me as she rides away.

I’m both stunned and elated, where my dad then says “That girl knew your mother!”

I said “thanks dad” as I hugged him."

Splinters of wood went hurtling through the air as Giuseppe continued to rain blows down on Pinocchio’s wooden frame.  “Do you want to know why you’ll never be a real boy? You’re an abomination.”

Years of neglect and abuse left Pinocchio’s wooden body battered and broken. The sound of woodlice borrowing into his wooden head kept him awake at night. He would stare at the burn marks leftover from Giuseppe’s drunken, belligerent cruelty and wondered if the heat from the fire felt as nice as its glow.

Giuseppe only left Pinocchio out of the house once a week to do errands. He hated going out, even more so than the cruel torment he received at home.  The cruelty of strangers was worse than what he got at home. As he walked nervously down the road towards the shop, people glared at home before shouting cruel taunts at him. He passed kids playing a game he had never seen before and got lost looking at the joy it brought them. The kids saw him watching, and joy turned to anger as they began chasing him down the street. His fragile legs buckled from under him, and he went tumbling to the ground. Just as the kids descended on him, a dishevelled looking woman jumped to his rescue.

The woman embraced him and picked him off the floor. The woman had a look on her face he had never seen before. He didn’t know what a smile was, but it looked nice, like the glow of a raging fire. People looked on in horror as she carried the poor wooden boy down the street to his house. Before she could get the boy home, a crowd gathered.  “I told you she’s a witch,” shouted one person as the momentum of hatred began to grow.  “Burn the Witch,” roared through the crowd as they marched her to the centre of the village. Pinocchio looked on in horror as the kind woman begged for her life.

Watching the only person to show him kindness being dragged to her death was too much to bear. “I’m cursed with no soul, burn me.” The crowd turned to face Pinocchio. Chants of burn them both echoed through the air as they mounted him to the same stake the woman was tied to.

Being made of wood, he wasn’t going to feel anything. He looked at the woman who was smiling down on him and felt sad for her. As the flames licked at his wooden feet he suddenly felt himself changing. The selfless act of trying to take the woman's place in death was enough to break the curse and turn Pinocchio into a real boy.

The crowd watched on in silent shame as the torturous and horrific scream’s from the poor boy could be heard throughout the village."

He has had it for quite some time, he got it after my mom passed away. She died in her sleep, from mysterious causes. Or at least what the police report says.
 
My father hasn’t allowed me into the farm or the shed or anywhere. I have never seen animals, he said that he hid them in the back because he doesn’t want them attacking me but I always thought that was a blatant lie. always, at night. When I pretend to be asleep, my father cuts and kills the animals. Every night I hear an ear-screeching high pitch scream. I told my father this, that it kept waking me up every night and he said that rabbits and other animals - when they die, they let out a last scream. Letting out all of the breath from their lungs before their eventual death. I had always thought that the scream of rabbits sounded like a small child screaming at the top of their lungs but I believed my father about the rabbits.
 
Of course, I listened to my father and kept on with my life. Doing what I was doing, hearing that same high-pitched scream every night before an eventual slice and their head thumping to the ground - where I would eat their cooked dead body laying on a platter on the dinner table.
 
One day. To be specific, October 30th. It was a rainy and gloomy day and my father wasn’t at the house or the farm. He was in town, getting groceries and more tools for the farm. They were worn out. On this day, I was curious. Curious about what animals were being kept on the farm, but my mother has always said “curiosity killed the cat” but I never believed that I always never listened.
 
I walked out to the farm from the house, wearing a yellow rain slicker and green rain boots that went up halfway to my knee. I walked through the thick mud that was past the deck, which led into a pathway that went down to the large wooden building where the animals were kept and the large metal shed where all of the pitched screams came, in the night.
 
I eventually reached a large metal door that went into the wooden building. I grabbed the doorknob and twisted it - the door creaked open with a broad sound, the rusty door hinges swung by a gust of wind. I walked into the wooden farm and looked around, I did not see any animals. Nothing. No cows, rabbits, chickens, anything.
 
I glanced over to the left side of the wall on the barn. At this moment I thought. I thought about what my mother had always said “curiosity killed the cat” but I realized that she wasn’t trying to teach me a life lesson. She was trying to warm me. The high-pitched screams weren’t from animals.
 
Carved into the wall on the barn were the words “HELP” with a splatter of blood covering the wall, next to it. I stared in horror, but as I walked away - fear struck. My father’s car rolled into the large stone-filled driveway."

That means *not of sound mind*, non compos mentis. Fancy talk for *unhinged fucking psycho*, which is what they really mean.

They’ll have you believe I planned it all, that when my husband and I drove into that tunnel, I drugged him, or knocked him unconscious. They’ll have you believe I somehow pulled him out, and then…well, I guess you’ve read the reports.

And I won’t deny having had second thoughts. I won’t. But to do that? No way, Jorge. Not a chance, Vance. That’s just not me.

The truth is that the moment we entered that tunnel, we went elsewhere. Not just some*where* else. Some*time* else? Out of this world. Or deeper within it?  We went to *his* place. His *realm*.

*Welcome to my Realm, Shae*, he said.

*Who the fuck are you?* I asked.

*I’m the Unmaker.*

*That doesn’t sound very good*, I suggested.

The tunnel wasn’t a tunnel any more. It was rocky, sure, cavernous, but there was an…*ambience* to the place, like how you get a feeling that you’re somewhere…really *fucked up*. Felt like a violation; a forced rupture in something sacred. An oozing flesh wound in reality, dripping with pus and rot.

He’d set a lovely table though. Flickering candlelight, two plates, glasses, a bottle of red wine. A large platter, covered with one of those metal domes, whatdoyoucallit.

Cloche? So posh. Let’s just call it a dome, Jerome.

*Sit down with me, Shae*, the Unmaker said. *Sit down and feast.*

He didn’t look like anyone I knew. No eyes on that leathery-flesh-pink-hued face, just a big old flapping mouth, filled with teeth which would put a great white shark to shame. He wore a cloth cut from the Universe itself I’d say, like a void cape, but he didn’t make a big deal out of it or anything. Perfect gentleman.

He lifted the dome. *Feast,* he said.

So I did. I sat down, and I stuffed my fucking face, meat-juices and blood and slimy weird parts flying everywhere. Didn’t even touch the cutlery.

I didn’t recognize him. How could I? Deep down though, I knew.

*Your wish has been granted*, the Unmaker proclaimed. *He has been Unmade*.

But I didn’t wish for that.

Did I?

They’ll have you believe I did.

They’ll have you believe my husband, who swore, on a bible no less, that *Yes, Your Honor, she did it*.

I woke up to his screams. So bestial, like a dying animal. Raw, guttural, meaningful. It took me a while to understand what he was trying to convey.

*Jesus-fucking-Christ, Shae. What have you done?!*

I just sat there, lost in thought, trying to get a particularly stringy piece of meat out of my teeth, not quite fathoming why I felt so…*different*.

*Ah*, I said, bloody-meat-juicy hands resting on my stomach. *That’s probably it.*

I'm rooting for all the bad guys to succeed and when you don't succeed and the good guy wins, it is a horrible day for me. The one bad guy I always root for is Brian, and Brian is a man who loves spoiling people. When he use to spoil kids in the care home with sweets and other goodies, even though it wasn't allowed, it's when he stops spoiling them is when the fun starts. When Brian suddenly stopped giving sweets to kids in the care home, they couldn't believe it. They all started shaking and shivering and then their body shape started changing in an insane fast pace. It was great to look at. 

From that day on I rooted for Brian to succeed and when he then got a job in a residential building as a concierge, the residents always forgot their fob cards but Brian always use to let them into the building and elevators. He started spoiling the residents by constantly giving them free fob cards and spare keys and the residents became spoiled, and always relied on the concierge to always let them into the apartment. Then when Brian suddenly stopped doing it for them, the residents started to get stomach cramps. Their insides started to move and shake and strange circular things started to come out of them and what came out of them looked like an alien. Their anger and frustrated at not being spoiled by the concierge anymore caused them great pain and the things going out of them was screaming and the strange oddities started killing other oddities which came out of other residents. 

This is why I root for Brian and all the other bad guys and even when it unknowing happened to me, I was still rooting for the bad guy. I got so spoiled at witnessing Brian spoiling people in general and then taking it away from them, and watching the victim suffer in such strange and odd ways. Some people started growing more heads and arms when they stopped being spoiled. Then when Brian suddenly stopped spoiling people and then taking it away, I started to have some unusual reactions. My skin started inverting and my organs started inverting and everything else looked like some 5th dimensional trip. It's getting better now and I am still rooting for the bad guys like Brian."

Eventually, a creature rises from it, foetal and weak, curled up into a little ball, with it's body squishy, like the skin would bend to your finger. With a plop, it gets ejected from the vat and splats onto the conveyor belt, painted black by the countless beings that went before it, and it moves away, onto the first machine. It enters, ugly chugs and burps emitting from the contraption, and it emerges, bigger now, but it's head would still explode if you gripped it. Onto the next machine. Raspy screeches can be heard from the outside, small at ⠀first, but building louder and louder until an unbearable crescendo of noise is all that you can hear. Once the screams reach their peak, they vanish without a trace, the thing coming out the other side still in a ball, but it's skin hard as diamonds. As if you'd be hurting yourself if you punch it. And finally, the third machine. Once it goes inside, nothing will be heard. Literally. A vacuum of sound that swallows up every noise that is being made. A cancerous growth of nothingness that makes every other machine in the room fall silent. It comes out the other side, no longer a piece of mould to shape, but standing tall and proud, ready to take orders. The conveyor belt ends, and the creation lands with a thump next to it's brethren, the army growing one thing stronger."

Winnona was by far the most beautiful woman Tom had ever dated, and he felt surprise almost every day that she had ever agreed to go out with him, a six or maybe seven on a good day. 

Not only was her face gorgeous, reminiscent of Cindy Crawford with her tawny hair, hazel -almost golden eyes- and wide generous mouth, her figure was perfect. Big boobs, small waist, a firm round ass and delicate beautifully molded arms and thighs. 

They began sleeping together after their second or third date. 

And try as he might, Tom found it impossible not to notice that her boobs were quite hairy. 

What made it so odd was that everywhere else which should be hairless, was quite immaculate. She definitely wasn’t some annoying feminist “body-hair positive” warrior.  There was no hint of a ‘stache,  her legs, her armpits, her pussy and bum crack were all smooth. But a fine layer of fuzz covered her boobs, spreading out below on her torso, fading just at the top, where her bra stopped. Her perfect pink nipples poked out of the fuzz, as desirable and delicious as any a pair. 

Winnona’s hairy boobs were not exactly a turn off- but they were definitely different. And he certainly didn’t like how individual strands came off in his mouth when he sucked them.

How could she not know? After all the effort he had put into dating her, there was no way he could tell her- plus the actual sex was amazing- fiery intense, like nothing else he had ever experienced. He couldn’t risk that. But the paradox remained- how could this woman, clearly conscious of her appearance and very skilled in the fine art of sex with men, not know her boobs were hairy? Not mention it, even jokingly? 

It must have been a month into their relationship when Winona said they couldn’t have sex that night – “it’s that time of the month baby”. 

“Noooo!” protested Tom. “I want you in my bed, I don’t care! Come over sweetheart, we’ll cuddle up all night!”

Winnona took some convincing “I get moody and restless” she warned him, but Tom by now had become so addicted to her presence in his bed that he didn’t care. “Please come baby, I want to be with you!”

Once in bed and cuddled up, Tom couldn’t stop himself, laying his head on her chest and letting his fingers roam in the fuzz of her boobs, pulling and tweaking her nipples endlessly. Winnona moaned “Stop it baby- I can’t- ohhhhh”

\-“Let me pleasure you” he whispered.

\-No you don’t underst… ahhhh” 

Winnona’s sentence trailed off into a howl as Tom felt her body shake and transform under his hands. He cried out in amazed horror as the fuzz spread and grew, her face elongated, a thick bushy tail sprouted. 

Within seconds, Tom found himself in bed with a beautiful aroused vixen, playfully nipping his body, brushing her thick tail along his shocked flaccid penis."

Loansharks and debtors had been knocking on my door every night, screaming curses and spraying ‘O$P$’ on the door. Rent was due. Utilities were due. I lost my job because of the pandemic. I found a new one though, one where I had to work the whole night with little pay. There were even times when I went hungry.

I was really desperate for a better job, so I scoured the Internet for one. Yes, even the Dark Web. The sites not for kids.

Then I found the website.

It was full of bright colours and devil cartoon characters in various poses. It promised big money and even fame.

All I needed to do was to sell my soul.

I was desperate. I clicked on the link, and filled up the form.

Thirty seconds later, there was a ping from my phone. The money had come in. One million dollars as a welcome gift. ‘And more to come!’ promised the tagline at the end.

My jaw dropped. A million dollars was a lot of money. At that exact moment, I knew all my problems were solved in an instant.

For every month after that, a million dollars were sent to my bank account. The loansharks were paid. The utilities were paid. I could afford to buy better food now--lobster and crab. I even bought a mansion on a private island.

Parties were held at my mansion every night, the bar stacked with the finest wines. It was at one of those parties when I saw the man in the skull mask. He was wearing a black cloak and was holding a scythe in his right hand.

My heart froze into ice, and the website, which I had long forgotten, came rushing back to me. Bodies moved to wild music and booming bass like a tidal wave, but the man sliced through them like they weren’t even there.

“Your time has come,” he said.

I nodded numbly. There was nothing more I could do.

He swung his scythe, and I felt my body burst open, blood exploding everywhere. The man rummaged around my insides, tossing out maroon kidneys, stomach, and heart, before closing his hand over a little squirming white orb.

He put the orb inside his cloak and stitched me up the best he could. “Have a good day,” he said formally.

After he left, the world darkened to a solid gray. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to enjoy myself. Even living in a mansion was not so fun anymore.

In the end, I sold everything and moved back to a single apartment. I even fell into old habits, drinking and drugs, and even that was truly tasteless.

I was downing a bottle of whisky, feeling nothing, when the man in the skull mask came back. This time he was morbidly cheerful, grinning behind his skull mask.

“Your soul was remarkably popular,” he said. “They want more of you.”"

Happiness is when you are warm and fed. When you feel the familiar smell. The smell of home.

I've been vagabonding since I was a teenager. I have never been excelling at the school and never achieved anything significant, unlike plenty of my peers. So at a very young age, I decided to travel instead of studying.

I've been to many states and many countries. I've met many people: rich and poor, honest and corrupted, beautiful and ugly. And even though my life has never been easy and I had to struggle through lots of misfortunes, I've never regretted my decision. 

Until the moment when I remembered my mother's face when she heard I was going to leave.

My poor mother, God bless her kind soul. Her cry was so heartbreaking. My father died before I was born. My younger sister was killed in the accident at the farm, so I was my mother's only family and her only company.

I left her without looking back and saying goodbye. I ran down the road until I stopped hearing her cries. I needed to stay far away from everyone to find myself. Even away from her.

But now, after so many years, I want to get back, to feel her warmth. To hear her voice. To sleep beside her. I need the love I couldn't find anywhere around the globe - the love that only a mother can give to her child.

...

I got off the train, took a deep breath, and looked around. It's hard to believe she still lives here. But I'm so happy to see the place where I grew up.

The train station hasn't changed a bit. Even the taxicab looks familiar - I wouldn't be surprised if this same car had taken me to the station many years ago. And these houses and gardens on the way to my house... I feel like I'm fourteen again.

This is my village. Oh, seriously? They never repaired that barn?... What a shame! Well, this is my street. A couple of more miles...
 
I'm here. My house.

The roses in the garden are blooming. What a beautiful season to come back. Who's that, trimming the bushes under the window? Mom?..

""Good afternoon, mother.""

She turns around. Her eyes immediately get wet. She's much older now, but she looks at me with the same love. Mom, I missed you. I missed you so much.

She hugs me, and together we walk into the house.

""Welcome back home, son. I'll show you your room,"" she says.

I pull out the knife and stab her. Again and again. I rip out her internals, her guts. I'm emptying her body through her screams. I'm making the room.

Finally, I find her womb and squeeze my head in. It's warm, just like when I was little. When I was happy.

So what is happiness to **you**?"

I could feel my palms sweating against her cool and calm hand as we walked. I’d never held hands with a girl before, let alone kiss one. My drunken friends now far behind us cooed and whooped drunkenly after us. 

“Mainly just spring break.” I admitted “We don’t know much about Lake Menatita other than the party spots. No cops, apparently!”

“Police do come by occasionally. But only for *really* bad stuff.” 

“What sort of *really* bad stuff?” I jeered. 

Johanna paused, biting her lip as if she were hiding some sort of secret. 

“Locals don’t like people talking about it…. But people go missing here. Like, a *lot*.” 

“Like, serial killers?”  

“No. They just go missing. No trace whatsoever. People think Lake Menatita possesses people to drown themselves.” 

Part of me wanted to know more, but part of me also didn’t want to turn the topic of conversation. When a gorgeous girl wants to take a walk along the lake with you, the last thing she wants to think of is brutal drownings. 

“Well, *that* wasn’t in the brochure!” 

“The locals don’t want people knowing. It drives off the spring break kids, which also means there are *never* any good guys here!”  

There it was. My move I’d been waiting for since Johanna said hello to our group. I waited until we were safely behind a sandbank, from my friends’ prying eyes. I slid one arm to her waist, pulling her close. I looked to her beautiful, sparkling eyes. 

“So, do I make the cut?” I asked, gently. I had no clue what I was doing. But whatever it was, it seemed to work. 

“Oh, I don’t know about that!” She pulled me closer “But I want to find out..”

Clothes quickly abandoned; I didn’t have the nerves to tell Johanna I was a virgin. But the moment she ran from the bank, her glorious naked body had my teenage mind whirling and I was following her as quickly as I could pull my pants down. 

We swam out to the middle of the lake, ensuring by now we wouldn’t be seen by my friends packing up and heading back to the cabin. 

“The water looks so black at night.” I looked to the water as we bobbed together, her body pinned to mine. 

*“It’s worse at the bottom.”*

As I looked back up at her, I saw Johanna’s sparkling eyes were gone and replaced with two black shiny sockets. Her smile was gone, replaced by jaws of pitch black with grey stone sharp teeth.  When I yelped, trying to pull away, I noticed how her skin seemed to become harder to pull off- almost slimy in texture. 

My mouth filled with lake water as I screamed, dragged down with someone’s teeth gripping my thigh. Grey, cold bodies swarmed over me in the water. Biting chunks of flesh. Chewing. Tugging apart. Pulling. Feeding. 

Until I too, would disappear without a trace."

The little one, in a tattered shroud, stood at the top of the staircase, her greasy hair knotted.  She let out a deep, menacing laugh, well beyond what her tiny frame should have been able to produce.  He ascended the stairs, getting close enough to smell the rotten breath that emanated from her low hiss. 

He pulled a dagger from his belt.  His fingers sank perfectly into the deep grooves of its wooden handle.

Six miles south of the Texas-Oklahoma border, my tire blew out. I’m not sure what it is that did it, but in one moment I was driving and the next my car was spinning out of control. I spiraled into a ditch. I stumbled out of the car into the blowing winds and dusty grounds. There was nothing as far as I could see. It was a wasteland. Then, out of the distance, I saw a smoke cloud billowing. As it got closer, I saw the sun glinting off the top of a black car. I held up my hand, hoping to get a ride. Luckily for me, the car pulled up alongside of me. It was a black Cadillac. The window rolled down, and I was greeted with the sounds of old doo-wop music. A man was sitting inside, dressed in a black suit. His face had a light stubble beard. His eyes were covered in mirrored sunglasses. 

“You want a ride, sport?”  
I nodded.   
“Well then hop in. I’ve got room.”  
As I started to climb into the car, I saw a man standing along the side of the road. He was elderly and hunched over. I could almost hear him say “Don’t get in that car”. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them, he was gone. I climbed into the car. The man started heading out along the road. The first thing that hit me was the uncomfortable heat of the car. It wasn’t horrible; it wasn’t desert sun heat, but it was uncomfortable, the kind of thing that gets under your skin. The man turned down the music. 

“Where you headed, sport?”  
“Kansas.”  
“Kansas? That’s a long way, isn’t it?”  
“Yes, sir.”

“Well, luckily for you, I’m headed up that way. Driving to North Dakota.”  
He extended his hand.   
“The name is Damien. Damien Luck.”

I shook it.

“Harvey Hudson.”

The ride was filled with pleasant conversation. After a few hours had passed, I looked out the window for a moment. I saw my car lying in the ditch, smoke funneling out of the back. 

“Damien?”  
“Yes, sir?”  
“Why are we back here.”  
“Back where?”  
“Where you picked me up?”  
“Because the dead can’t go too far.”  
I turned to him.   
“What did you say?”  
“Tell me, son, are you religious?”  
“Damien, what the hell did you say?”

“You know about all that Heaven and Hell talk? God and the Devil? Well, we have quotas we need to fill; a number of people we need to get each year. Unfortunately for you, people have been good recently. Or they haven’t been dying. You know that old man you saw? Congrats, you saw God. But hey, he couldn’t stop me.”  
“You killed me?”  
“Yessir. Look, don’t be mad. It happens to everyone eventually. Now I think we’ve arrived.”  
The mountains swelled around us, and I began to fall down, down, down. Know this: the devil is real. And he drives a Cadillac."

“I vant to take your blood,” they’d say, shoulders hunched, arms raised above their heads. They’d laugh, the patients would laugh, and I’d tie a tourniquet around the patients arm. I’d smile and shake my head.

I know it was harmless and cut the tension, but it annoyed me. The patients already didn’t like me. No one was ever excited to have their blood drawn. Did the staff really have to compare me to a monster? I suspected they joked about it private as well. I mean it was kind of accurate, I had the look: dark hair, tall, thin, pasty skin, and a mandated black uniform. I also worked nights. 

One night I had to draw an old demented lady. As soon as she saw me she began screeching “Vampire!” Staff had to hold her down as she chanted prayers. They stifled giggles. I was humiliated. I stormed into the break room and collapsed into a chair. I then realized I still had a tube of the woman’s blood in my pocket. I couldn’t tell you why, but I popped the top off and threw it’s contents down my throat. I don’t know what disgusted me more, the fact that I had done it, or the fact that I enjoyed it. 

It became a weird addiction. Soon I was drawing an extra tube of blood off every patient. It helped. I could tune out their stupid jokes. All I cared about was getting the blood. I couldn’t concentrate on anything until I drank. I’d go through the motions then rush to hidden places to have a drink. The fresher it was, the better. 

The night I decided to go full vampire was pretty impulsive. I walked into the room of a comatose man and knew this was my chance. I sterilized the area, drew his blood, then brought the crook of his arm up to my mouth. His hot, metallic blood sprayed down my throat as I pulled the tourniquet tighter. It was almost orgasmic. My eyes rolled and I felt weak.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. I threw the arm down and pulled up my mask as a nurse walked in.

“What are you doing?” She asked, definitely sensing that she had startled me. 

“Sorry, just getting blood. I’m a bit jumpy in here. It’s too quiet.” I answered while gesturing to the man.

The nurse pulled out a notepad and started jotting down vital signs. She nodded and replied, “It is quiet. It’s so sad. He’s been here before. Nice guy. He’s not going to make it this time. HIV is one hell of a disease.”"

No. Something fouler. You look up from your phone, scan the cafe with your eyes; probe the air with your nostrils. The people around you seem oblivious to it. How could they be? The smell is awful, thought-erasing. You look left and right, up and down, but see nothing out of the ordinary; no festering pools, no flaming trash cans, no bubbling baby diapers. Your eyes begin to water, the smell is a tangible, pervasive thing; an immense odour.  

You feel hot, the smell has brought with it a considerable heat; a wave of mounting humidity. You remove your jacket, slowly, so as to not draw attention to yourself. You don’t want people to think you’re mad. The jacket comes off, you casually drape it over the other chair at your table. Everything is fine, everyone is calm. It’s just you—and the smell, *and* its increasingly awful heat. You begin to sweat. The beads fall down your face like tears, and for a moment it feels like you’re crying. You definitely want to. You’re fighting a war on two fronts; the smell before you, the heat at the rear. Uncomfortable circumstances, to say the least.  

The smell is a like grip around your throat, a clothespin on your nose. You detect not one note of foulness, but *many.* It is a conglomerate of stenches; an air-souring amalgam of putridity.  

The heat slaps you, tenderizes your cheeks. You recall how, under times of duress, people have done strange things, and were later exonerated for the breakage of society’s laws; after the necessity of their aberrant behavior was later made obvious. Finding hope in the retroactive justification of your behavior, you remove your clothes and drape them over your jacket.   

People have now noticed you. Some scream. You ignore them, try to endure the heat; concentrate on the smell. You attempt—with Herculean willpower—to fight it, to banish it from the world, through sheer psychological force. Unfortunately, the more you concentrate, the more powerful the smell seems to grow. It has achieved truly profane level of noxiousness; it is plainly not of the Earth. Still, you combat it, determined to die violently if you cannot win. Your nostril hairs burst into flames; smoke trails from your nasal passages. The tears and sweat upon your face evaporate instantly. Your left eye swells, and in a moment of inexpressible agony it pops; splattering your table with blood and eye gunk.  

Consciousness gradually slips away from you; all this time the smell has been snuffing out your life-force. The café has emptied; it’a just you and your mortal enemy. You raise a limp hand, a feeble gesture of defiance, and watch, one-eyed, as the skin melts away from your fingers; as the bones liquify. Death has entered the chat. The heat is truly Hadean: a sweltering, infernal force. Even as your face sags and collapses inward, melting into your skull, you smell it—the unconquerable stench. "

I kissed his forehead with much love before gently placing him into his comfy bed.

“I love you son!”

“I love you too dad!”

I slowly closed the creaky wooden door, before I leave the ghost-quiet hallway into the warm living room.

And there I see my love, my sweet-bearing eternal muse of my life. Her face delighted with rosy cheeks, a circular-shaped jawline, lips in the shape of an eagle, bristled in a suntanned skin that is as warm as the sun itself.

I gently wrapped her into my own loving arms like sushi, feeling the comfort of her sweater.

“Every moment I spent with you; I question how did I miss you for so long.”

She lets out a cute little giggle. She asked with such a delightful and happy voice.

“Why is that sweet-pea?”

“I did not realize how broken I was until I spent time with you, how sad I was before we talked. It made me correct myself, and it’s all because of you. I love you for that, darling.”

“It’s those raccoons again. Hold on love, I’m going to take care of them.”  
 I opened the door with furious anger, and closed the door before I roared onto the little rascals.

“Get out of here you pint-sized pests!”

As I slowly turned around after cleaning the trash, the door is somehow open.

In a shivering stance, I walked into the house to see my love gone. Then, a noise in the kitchen ringed my ears.

I sprinted to find my wife standing still, as if she was frozen. Her rosy cheeks gone, the jaw more distinct, and the skin a little bit lighter than usual.

“Honey, is there anything wrong?”

“No, nothing’s wrong.""

Her voice wasn’t in fear, nor delight, not had she shown any emotion that I remember her for. Something was wrong.

I slowly walked to her to touch her face, only to feel nothing but abysmal arctic-cold. I was too late to realize what was wrong.

I felt a sudden stab in my abdomen, followed by a cold kiss on the lips from my “wife”. I then felt something moving in my throat, and then down into the deep side of my organs. Every flesh burst inside, internal bleeding begun, and I feel more and more holes cutting to the other side. I wanted to scream, but my throat was drowning in blood.

It had been months since we've last seen eachother due to a sudden resignation from his job. The last day he wore that EMT uniform was also the day where I saw the emptiness in his eyes that got me wondering just what he saw in that house whose call I answered.  

A familiar figure shook me out of the thought as I got up from my seat to meet him halfway and the way he hugged me back said all the apologies for days of unanswered messages, days of missed calls, and days of being an absent friend. I hoped that he knew that there was nothing to forgive in the first place and that I will always understand. 

Small talk was thrown out of the window as he wasted no time explaining the horror that got him retreating to his shell and away from soceity. 

I remember answering a 9-1-1 call where a woman was screaming for help relaying that her husband was trying to stab her. Red and blue sirens soon glowed on that night of October as the cops and EMT's made their way towards that well rounded neighborhood. 

A release of breath was made before the cup met his lips, like the bitter liquid would summon the courage he needed to continue the story. 

His eyes focused on his intwined fingers as he said that the moment the officer got the screaming husband out of the house, him and his partner were left to assist the woman who laid in her own blood, a sliver of life still evident in her soft intake of breaths, on that cold and weary hallway.

Tears kissed his eyes and he immediately covered them as I reassured him that it was ok to stop but he soldiered on. It took a while for him to find composure and when he did, I finally understood why he did what he did.

The woman laid dying in that house with a ripped belly and on her left was a baby, covered in stab wounds, whose umbilical cord was still attached to its placenta that was still inside its mother. 

A desperation laced her voice as she weakly begged 

""Please save my baby.""

Death arrived before them and my friend left that house dead as well. 

We exited that cafe as different people with hope for humanity running on thin ice. 

Talk of the husband's account made its round in our building and its tale added even more monstrosity to the tragedy of that October night. 

The story goes that in the middle of an argument they both confessed to  infidelity and when the wife, in a burst of anger, screamed that the baby wasn't his, he lost it. 

I answered one last call that day, left a resignation letter and made my way to therapy."

Dave lay slumped in the snow, a lonely imprinted set of footprints lay on the ground.

'Fucking bitch' he spat, as blood trickled out his mouth. You see Dave is here slowly dying all alone because he found his wife sleeping with another man earlier that day. 

He had no where to go so he has just been dragging himself through the snow filled roads of his little village. He made his way to the only pub for miles, he has no emotions and couldn't feel anything. He longed to feel something, needed to feel anything, so he picked up a pool que, walked over to Butch, the hard man around town, and with one pathetic swing whacked him across the back. 

Butch stood up, looked this frail middle aged man in the face, he seen his eyes full of hurt, fear and broken, as much as it pained him Butch couldn't let that slide, he grabbed him round the scruff of the neck dragged him outside and punched him repeatedly, screaming at him is this what you want? 

Dave had a crimson mask, broken nose and he was sure he had lost some teeth, all wasn't lost though, he managed to get a bottle of his favourite whisky from the bar. 

He dragged himself through the snow, found a wall and slumped himself against it, he was going to sit there, drink his whisky and let this blizzard end his suffering.

Back to the present, the snow surrending him had been dyed red, quarter of his whisky was left. Daves drunked mind was in overdrive, why did she do this, how could she do this, how long has this been going on for. One thing is for sure he thought, I'm not going without taking her with me. 

Weakly he got to his feet, trudged through the snow to his home, kicked the door open, 'honey I'm home!' He yelled. 

His wife came running downstairs, wondering where he had been, she seen him covered in blood and snow, stinking of whisky taken aback she froze at the bottom step.

Dave closing in on her, he raised his arm holding that was holding the bottle, and slammed it over her head, she crashed to the floor, a pool of blood slowly forming.

Dave rang 999 put the phone on the table and laid beside his wife waiting for them to arrive."

“Did you say something, Mia?”

“Hmmm?” she questioned, turning to look at me.

“Uhh, you said something, right?” I laughed as I stopped at the red light.

“I know my voice is practically honey to your ears but try to stay in reality, babe.” She laughed.

“That it is.” I agreed, and she blushed at my directness. Several years of marriage and she still wasn’t use to my forwardness. I shot her a wink as the light turned green and we sped off towards home.

\---

Late at night after I finished using the bathroom, I heard Mia’s voice again.

“I know you’re not happy where you are. Cross the divide.”

“Mia…?” I called out in the direction I heard her voice.

“Come be with me, Lucas.” her mellifluous voice chimed from the kitchen.

Turning the light on, I saw Mia behind the glass door of our back patio.

But she was just asleep in the bed.

Why did she get up, and more importantly, why was she outside so late at night?

It must have been absolutely chilly. Waves of shadow fanned out as the wind whipped through her silky raven hair, those beautiful lips that reminded me of cupid’s bow curled upward, hand pressed against the glass door.

Running over, I unlocked the door to let her in but she stepped back and held her arms out.

“Join me.”

My vision shifted, peripheries casting everything that wasn’t my wife into darkness. Flickers of light twinkling like stars blinked in and out of existence and just as I was about to cross the threshold, the door was slammed shut.

“Lucas, you’re letting all the damn heat out of the house.”

Mia frowned, arms covering herself. Her scolding stare became one of concern.

“You were just...when did you...”  my lungs felt as if they were on fire.

“Jesus, Lucas you’re as pale as a ghost,” she put her hand to my forehead, “you’re freezing! We need to get you to bed.”

I came down with a severe case of the flu and had to take off of work for a week, Mia watching like a hawk the whole time, as if lucidity escaped me.

But I’m not the only one acting bizarre, recently she’s begun hanging iron ornaments all around the house, says its a decorative change of pace.  Also, she’s clasped an iron necklace around my neck that I can’t remove. I haven’t heard or seen the other Mia since.

To be honest, I don’t think the woman I’m living with is my wife at all. Her words are more hollow by the day and it’s not just her.

My friends.

This house.

All of it is fake, made of aged parchment. Sometimes I stare at the faux blue sky and wonder if I’ll be able to join my real wife. I wonder if I’ll be able to cross the divide."
r8sihx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r8sihx/my_fingerprint_is_a_map/,My fingerprint is a map,208,7,1638633331.0,"This is a crazy story about how I found my biological parents. The ending wasn't a happy one.

I grew up in foster care, constantly bouncing from one house to another. Until I met the Reynolds. They were lovely people. Always honest and always caring. They were the ones that told me as much as they could about my strange circumstances. 

See, I have weird fingerprints. Think of a labyrinth and you'll understand. I also have three strange birthmarks. One on my left arm resembles a looking glass. One on my thigh is in the shape of Manhattan. And the final one, behind my right ear,  in the shape of a hangman's noose. 

Mandy Reynolds, a prolific puzzlers, caught on quickly one Sunday afternoon when I cut myself while helping prepare dinner. 

""Well, won't you look at that,"" she said, pointing to the thumbprint I left behind on the counter. ""It looks just like your birthmark.""

She was right. The thumbprint was the same shape and size as the Manhattan birthmark. Curious, I dabbled my thumb in the blood from my finger and pressed it on the birthmark. The lines of my print wove around like a children's puzzle. One entrance, and one destination. 

Mandy, being Mandy, took a quick picture and then downloaded and printed it out so she could decipher the route. After a few attempts she had it. 

""Now, all I need is a map,"" she told her husband, Barry. 

""Don't be entertaining that stupid notion, Mandy. The boy doesn't need you adding to his heavy life. Let him be.""

I've always liked Barry. A stern, but fair, Irish man. But that wasn't going to stop her. 

Lucky for us, we only live in Chester, New Jersey, so it wasn't long before we were in Manhattan entertaining her stupid notion. I was as much pushing for this as she was. 

For an hour, paper map flying in the city breeze, we found the shop. A small delicantasant. It was boarded up. Derelict. But as soon I touched the door, it swung open. 

We crept through. Wind blew up from a doorway where a path led down some stone steps to a basement below. With the light of my phone, Mandy and I descended. 

At the bottom, a room opened up. Two skeletons hung from nooses. Scraps of clothes, dirty with age draped off boney shoulders. 

But underneath them all was a message. It read: I killed your family. You'll be next. Follow your other thumb I'd you want to understand why.

I didn't understand, until I saw a scrap of paper with a map of London on it. Dizzy with horror, I reopened my wound and dabbed my other thumb down on the map. It lined up perfectly. 

I'm scared to find out who is behind this. But I think I have to. To avenge my family."

I have made it my mission in life to purify haunted bodies and where there is passion there is determination. The determination to do what needs to be done to cure haunted bodies and I remember my first one. It was a man in his 50s and I went up to him and I told him about haunted bodies and that his body was haunted. He looked at me in such an unfriendly fashion but I just smiled like I had just taken his girlfriend away from him. 

I then picked up a rock and smashed it against his head. Then I waited a moment and as I watched him shake a little, his body stood still. Then a glow of light came out of him like a little ball and floated away. I was so happy that I cured a body from being haunted and things are always better when they are not haunted. I knew this man was grateful that I made his body not haunted anymore even though he wasn't showing any signs of gratitude. It doesn't matter majority of humans never show gratitude. 

Then the next person who I wanted to help make her body not haunted anymore, was a woman of professional stature. She had a fancy car and she was always talking on the phone in a business like tone, she had no idea that her body was haunted. I wanted to help her so much and so when she unlocked her car I rushed in and got us both in her car. She was crying and scared but I told that I was here to help with her haunted body but she wasn't having it. I shot her once and as I saw her fighting the haunted thing inside her body by spewing blood, I saw the glowing thing again floating out of her. Her body was no longer haunted. 

I told someone of my good deeds and he told me that our bodies aren't haunted and that they have souls inside them, but souls are still like ghosts that haunt the body. I must up my game and free multiple haunted bodies at the same time, time to get a gun."

r8oxsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/r8oxsj/every_evening/,EVERY EVENING,143,9,1638621864.0," 

Julia stared into the dining room, her face almost touching the window pane, as she did every evening.  

It was still light outside, the curtains were drawn back and she could easily see her husband, Charles, the man who vowed to love her, seated at the dinner table together with this other woman. And a teenage boy. Was he Charles’s son? She had no idea, even though she had been Charles’s wife for three years.  

They were talking and laughing, eating chicken with potatoes and salad. Charles reached for the wine. The teenager asked for some. His mother shook her head, but laughed, and Charles mixed some wine with water in a small glass before handing it to the boy.  

The emotions were as raw as the first day Julia found out, rooted in this same spot she stood now. Disbelief, bewilderment, confusion, numbing shock, slowly slipping away to pure fury. She had wanted to break the window, leap into the room, howling and smashing the glinting glasses and plates, and grind the smiling happy faces of Charles and his secret family into the shards, hear them scream in agony, see their blood splatter everywhere. She saw herself grab this woman’s long red hair, twist it around her fist and smash her head into the wall. Stab Charles repeatedly with the long sharp knife. How could he do this to her?  

She still wanted to do all that, she just couldn’t. Tears of helpless agony ran down her face.  

Julia remembered all the nights he worked late. The work trips away. God it was so cliché, so obvious. Like every other woman fooled since time immemorial- he had played her for a fool, which she was. The signs had been there- the bills not adding up, the excuses, the delays. And then, one day, a year ago, she had followed him to an address she had found on a bill in his pocket. The last day of her marriage.  

Even though the marriage was over that very first night she found out, she couldn’t help coming back, every evening, staring at them have dinner together, and dream of vengeance and murder. 

She had watched them eat dinner every single evening since that night, unable to stop herself. She knew all their food quirks by now, how the boy fussed if his different foods “touched” each other on the plate, how the mom piled up salad on her plate to control calories.  

She knew she had to stop, she had to stop going back every evening, she had to let go. But she was powerless – every evening at the same time, she would find herself outside their window, until she could no longer bear it, and sobbing with pain and rage she would turn away and rush blindly into the street, colliding with a speeding car.  

Exactly the same as that first evening, more than a year ago, when she had died instantly on impact. "

I have caught her out on a couple of occasions and proved that she was incorrect. She would then pull that stupid open mouthed shocked face for a few seconds. She would then refuse to speak to me for a few days until I eventually caved and apologised to her.

Lately she has been driving me crazy as she won a local trivia quiz and has been bragging about it nonstop. She would always smirk and tell me that I am so lucky to have a mother as intelligent as her. I decided to take her down  peg or two.

I forced her to sit down in a chair in our living room and told her the rules of our quiz. If she got all the questions right then I will bring her out for dinner but if she gets any wrong then she will be punished. She reluctantly agreed to take part in the quiz.

I was starting to get worried as the quiz progressed because she was getting all of the questions right. I decided to throw in an awkward one for the last question. I asked her for the name of main actor in the 2003 film The Room. She sat there open mouthed and I knew that I had caught her out.

I told her that the name of the actor was Tommy Wiseau. Her face went deathly pale as I reached for the pliers and attached it to her fingernail. I couldn't help but smile smugly listening to her scream of agony as I ripped out her fingernail. Maybe from this point forward she will learn to be a bit more humble"

Tiles flaking like clay dandruff

Left derelict,  it had enough


With a heave and crunch of masonry

The House was no longer stationary

Unhinged, the door flapped wide

An empty stomach hidden inside


The hall carpet lolled like a tongue

Broken pipes and cables hung

It shuffled down the vacant street

Slowly, on splintered makeshift feet


It looked at rows of beautiful homes

The warm glow of life it had never known 

It wanted, no needed occupants 

Whether willing or resistant


It creaked and groaned as it made its way

Scooped up dog walkers, business talkers starting their day

It gobbled a crowd waiting for the bus

A whole old residence home (they made no fuss)


A playground of smoking teens

Old, young anyone that was seen

They rolled down its dusty, cobwebbed hall

To fill the abode from wall to wall


Now full to the brim the town stood silent

It never intended to be so violent

But after standing so alone 

It needed bodies to call it home"

I sighed, closed my book and looked outside. A face stared back at me.
 
Just the face. No body or neck. No bony fingers that tapped my window. It floated outside, the gingery hair wild in the wind and waving around like a nest of hissing snakes. Rain dripped down bony white cheeks.
 
The eyes bulged out, veins popping out of the whites and stormy-blue irises. The nose was long and thin, with snake-holes for nostrils. The lips were painted crimson, the mouth wide open in a smile, revealing pearly-white fangs.
 
And still came that ghastly *tap tap tap* sound. “Let me in,” the face whispered.
 
I hurriedly closed the curtains, double-checked my locks, and leaned against the wall, my breath coming out in short gasps. My heart was beating so hard against my ribs I thought it might fracture. All I could think about was that face.
 
To distract myself, I pulled out my phone and began surfing the Internet, hoping to take my mind off things. I looked at the funniest memes on Reddit and was laughing out loud when I got a ping.
 
From an unknown number.
 
The profile picture was **the face**.
 
*can i come in* 
 
My heart started to pound again. I turned off my phone, and there it was on the shiny black screen, leering back at me, unwavering.
 
I slowly turned around.
 
There was no one there. No floating face.
 
I forced myself to calm down. Maybe I just needed to get some sleep.
 
I headed to my bedroom, keeping a wary eye out for any intruders or pranksters. I changed into my pyjamas and prepared to brush my teeth. As I looked in the mirror, the colour drained out of my face.
 
Until it was bone-white. My eyes started to swell until I could see the veins, my irises turning a deep blue. My nose grew smaller; my eyebrows settling itself into place. My lips grew redder; my mouth widened into a sinister smile. Pearly-white fangs emerged from under my teeth and grew outwards into twin walrus tusks.
 
Then my bone-white face cracked, revealing crimson scars.
 
I stared in horror at the face, *my* face, smiling back at me.
 
Then came the rhythmic *tap tap tap*. I looked down to see my bony white fingers tapping on the glass.

The darkness surrounds me, embraces me, wants me, needs me... more than I need myself. 

The sleeping breaths of my children down the hallway aren't enough to make me want to stay... I need to feel more than the nothingness inside. The darkness calls me.

As the blade rips through my flesh, the blood pours forth in a wave of ecstasy, of freedom, of release.

It was like any other evening. My father smoking his pipe by the fire. My mother knitting in the other room. It was, however, especially cold that night, with howling winds and snow. But we were safe inside.  

Then came a knock at the door. 

It seemed unreal at first. We did not live near town or any road. We were surrounded by forest on every side except for a slim dirt path. 

The knocking came again, louder, followed by a moaning. My parents let the desperate stranger in. 

The stranger said very little. He appeared weak and disheveled. My mother gave him stew and my father his pipe. Then they retreated into their room to talk and left me alone with him. 

It was only when we were alone that he looked at me. His eyes were blue and his skin white as bone. I noticed, too, that his nails were exceptionally long. Yet I wasn’t repulsed by him. Afraid, yes, but at the same time attracted to him. 

Demap sat there puffing the pipe my father gave him, blowing Os up toward the portrait of my great grandfather hanging above the mantle. Then he spoke.

“Now this is an ugly man,” he said, pointing to the portrait, and I laughed. It was such a rude thing to say, though it’s true my grandfather was quite ugly. 

Then I asked him where he’d come from. 

“Young man, would you believe me if I told you I crawled out of a dream?”

Yes, that’s what he said. It was such a fantastical thing to say, I thought he was joking so I laughed. Even today I don’t know what he meant by that. 

My parents returned and told Demap that my father could bring him to town in the morning to see the doctor. He agreed and thanked my parents. My father offered him my bed, so I slept in his chair by the fire. 

Demap was standing over me when I woke up. I noticed then how tall he was, and that he was wearing my father’s clothing. 

“Where are my parents?” I asked him.

“They’ve gone into town to fetch the doctor,” he told me. “They should be back any minute.”

As you know, that was a lie. Demap had killed my parents, violently, he would later tell me. He loved the pain people felt, not only when you injured them, but at all times. “The agony of existence,” he called it. It was like he could sense it, the suffering of others. He would smell it in the air and differentiate one sort from another. The pain I felt at the loss of my parents was, to him, a delicacy; and my innocence kept it fresh for longer than most.

I was his ward until I turned 17, at which time he sent me off with a large sum of money, a knife and my father’s pipe."

She’d sat across from him awkwardly giggling and swirling a straw in her drink. They talked about typical first date things. After a few drinks he asked her to tell him something she’d never told anyone before.

She nervously giggled and shyly told him about her hamsters. How when she was a child she had a hamster. One day it bit her. She’d reacted by squeezing it until it no longer moved. She didn’t want her mom to find out what had happened, so she stuck it’s lifeless body back in the cage. There was a new hamster in the cage the next day after school. She laughed and told him that she had probably like 10 different hamsters growing up.
It was fucked up, but adorable. 
Their next date, he brought a hamster and they dissected it together. Then they made love. 

Their relationship moved fast after that. She moved in two weeks later. He felt like he had known her his whole life.They spent their date nights roaming the streets, looking for strays. 

On their one month anniversary he bought her an empty charm bracelet and a dog from the pound. As she cut open it’s stomach a heart shaped charm fell out. As he clipped the charm to the bracelet, she cried and told him no one had ever done anything so romantic for her. It became their thing. Within six months her bracelet was full. He knew he had to do something big.

Two weeks after their six month anniversary, he blindfolded her and led her to the basement. She looked so cute in her surgical gown. He removed her blindfold, she clapped her hand over her mouth, and her eyes welled with tears. It had been so easy to get the homeless man to come home with him. It’d been even easier to drug and force feed him. 

He was so nervous as she dove the knife into the man’s abdomen, blood spraying both of them. He figured every guy felt like this before they popped the big question. After several minutes of digging around she finally found the ring. He took it from her and dropped to one knee. Of course she said yes. They passionately kissed. She giggled as she wiped a splotch of blood from his cheek.

He knew they’d live happily ever after."

Mostly I hear my own heart-beat, and a kind of ringing. I can tell that I’m somewhere far from people, but there are no signs of life. No signs of animals even, not even the call of a familiar bird or an unfamiliar one. 

I am tied with rope, which is smart, I think. Chains I could slip out of. Chains cannot be pulled tight, but rope is different. Rope can be knotted and pulled so taught, gosh, taught enough that I am having trouble feeling my fingers. I know they’re there, I think I can wiggle them, but they are not able to slip the ropes from my wrists. It has to be rope… and my feet are the same, anchored to a heavy wooden chair so large I cannot rock it. I cannot shuffle my way out… a throne! My very own throne! Or perhaps it is my casket.

I think I might die here.
How did this happen? I was walking… I do that sometimes. I feel lost a lot and sometimes when you feel that way the best thing to do is get lost yourself… so I walk. Tonight I walked a little too far. I might have even left the town-limits entirely. But there were houses, and there were streets so I kept walking because it felt right. 

“Got a cig?” He said, slurred, stinking: I could smell the smoke on him so I don’t know why he was asking for another.

“No.” Did I need to say more than that? I kept walking, keeping my eyes to myself. I thought of him as a nobody, maybe that was my mistake. I didn’t think he’d cause a fuss. I didn’t think there would be trouble, until I felt a sharp crack, like a bell ringing. I felt a wetness down my forehead, a stinging in my eyes, as blackness took me.
Why would they want somebody like me? A nobody. I’m not famous, I don’t have family or friends… I don’t think my job would pay a week’s pay to keep me alive. That’s got me curious… I can only imagine they’ve taken me for the worst of reasons. 

Gut me and sell my organs for cheap, or maybe they just want to slice me up because it’ll feel good. I get that, I think maybe I’m just a way for them to feel alive. But you know what… I won’t let ‘em. All I have to do is bite my tongue hard, and swallow whatever piece comes off. Let it hang in my throat, and breathe it in… and you know what? Dying is the most exciting thing I think I’ve ever felt. So in a way I think I should say thank you… thanks."

I was eating lunch and my milk wouldn’t open. I stabbed it with my fork and people screamed. They took me to the nurse, doctors, psychologists, therapists, whatever you could name. This never helped me though I think it only made me tune out the world.

The ink doesn’t come out.
Fine.
I ask the girl next to me for one and she gives me a pencil.
Whatever.
I start taking notes. It breaks.

I take out my blade and start sharpening the pencil the old fashioned way. A girl next to me screams.
I look up confused.
“what happened?” I ask somebody near me.

The only time the door opens is when the medicine men come, with barks for compliance and needles full of pain.

I like it when the medicine men come.

Often i will get to have several days of sickness or dizziness or some other kind of affliction to keep me occupied.

there are only a few patches of carpet left, most of it have been worn away from pacing up and down.

I was somewhere before I was in this room. I know because I remember forgetting it. I was so scared at the time. I wrote everything down, every minor detail I could recall, on any material i could get my hands on but then the medicine men took them away. So I tried to hide them. Writing what scraps of memories were left and hiding them anywhere I could, the medicine men always found them.

Now I can't bring myself to care. looking back at it they feel like a different person, so in a way they aren't my memories to mourn.

I sometimes wonder where I got the pens or the paper. They must of come from the medicine men, like this has. Why have they given this to me.

was it the medicine men? I woke up with it on my desk. to get it in here they must of opened the door... so it must of been them.

They usually shout...

why am I writing this?

why am I here?

my room is 10 paces from the door to the back and 5 paces from the left wall to the right. It's walls are beige and it's odourless. Inside there is a bed, a desk, a toilet, a dumbwaiter, a notepad, a pen and me.

my room is 10 paces from the desk to the door and 5 paces from the door to across the hall. the door across the hall is locked. 

my room is 100 paces from the 1st big door to the 2nd big door with dozens of small doors along the way. sometimes the medicine men will walk past me and open a door but I never get to see inside.

my room isn't my room... my room has walls and a door and the medicine men. my not room has no walls, no doors, no medicine men and stones for a floor, ones that hurt when stepped on and throw up dust when kicked.

my not room has medicine men, with whispers for calm and needles of pain.

my room is 20 paces from the door to the window and 7 paces from side to side. the medicine men come often, with smiles of pride and whole machines full of pain."

Demanding of us, policing us, controlling us.

Some people say it fell to earth during the 21st century. Others say the corporations built it.

Whatever the case we are all made servants to it. Brainwashed and powerless. Only in brief moments when we’re underground do its effects dissipate and we can think again.

We toil for it. We gather the materials and build the infrastructure to make the tower larger.

But every once in a while a group of us is forced to march inside and is never seen again.

We hear screaming from it sometimes. As well as the sound of blades and saws and the damp squelch of flesh being ripped apart. The hellish noises echo for miles in every direction.

We have no idea why it’s here, or how long it will stay. Only that we are powerless to stop it, powerless forevermore.

Our dog Fern had to be sent away to live with my sister since she wouldn't stop barking at my child. 

I thought that it had been just a temporary stage of getting to know a new person in the household but the way Fern growled whenever my baby was in the room indicated that she was ready for a violent act. 

It felt like abandonment when I handed Fern's leash to my sister and my heart broke when the pup kept looking back at me with questioning eyes as they walked away. 

My sister promised to update me and send pics and videos of Fern but that did not deter the sadness that wrecked my chest.

 I allowed myself to mourn when I got back to my vehicle, the tears came in floods when I thought about how Fern gave us years of unconditional love only for me to repay her this way.

I came home and was greeted by heavy silence when I was so used to hearing paws tapping on the floor...empty wouldn't even begin to describe it.

The first night without my pup came the howlings.

Echo after echo covered our surroundings like an unwelcomed shroud. The canine tones varied from anger to whines, its as if they were begging us to leave. 

I stayed up as sleep didn't come and gave my focus on my sleeping son. Barely a month old and the world was already cruel to him and just when I thought I couldn't cry anymore, that thought was enough to break me. 

All I wanted was for my child to grow up loved and prayed that God would hear me. 

Morning strolls were never easy since the neighborhood cats and dogs vocalized their displeasure but kept their distance. We had to pass the house of Old lady Warren everytime and each time we did she would give us a look of distaste as her dog yapped away. 

A smoke would escape her lips as she sat on her porch while I gave my best apologetic smile and a tiny wave in the hopes of dispersing the tense atmosphere but the scowl on her face seemed permanent.

On my son's first birthday I decided to bring food to the old woman for it was the least I could do. I approached her property and handed her the token of my peace offering before speaking my intention.

""I'm so sorry for all the noises that we cause. I just don't know why animals don't like my son."" 

Exasperation laced my voice as I felt the familiar confusing thoughts swim in my mind.

Old lady Warren stepped closer to me as she discarded the cigar before answering

""It's not your son they don't like."" 

My eyes followed her wrinkled hand as it landed on the cross of her rosary that hanged on her neck as she continued with

It seemed small at first, coincidental. I was leaving the market, and there he was walking in. It was so brief I almost didn't realize it was him. Then again at different bar with my friends. We were shooting pool, and as I was making a shot, out of the corner of my eye I saw him lounging at the bar. When I stood back up he was gone.

Yesterday, while driving to work when I was stopped at a light, I looked at the car next to me, and there he was, staring at me. I was so distracted that someone had to honk for me to realize the light was green. When I looked over again, he was gone. I don't understand why he is everywhere. I don't think it's guilt. I know what happened was my fault, but surely it's not guilt.

I didn't even let him buy me a drink. I chatted a bit, I didn't want to be rude, but when he kept on with his advances, I told him no. It's hard to mistake a no. Yet he still yelled after me as I left, crying that I was leading him on. Later, I saw him again... That was what was my fault. Ending up back at his place, that was my fault. I don't even know how it happened. I didn't want to do it.

The final straw was when I saw him standing outside my front door as I was pulling into my driveway. Heart racing, I jammed my car into reverse and drove to the trailhead. I needed to walk to clear my head. It was going to be dark soon, so I grabbed a headlamp and went on my way. At the top of the trail, I went straight instead of following the bend that would take me back down the mountain. There was a clearing up ahead that I always go to when I am stressed.

The trees and  deepening darkness surrounded me, a blanket from any unwanted eyes. Once I reached the spot I froze. He was there, arrogantly staring me down, the setting sun casting him in an angry lurid light. Hurriedly I rushed to him, forcing him to step aside. I didn't hear his shouts as I dug at the spot he was standing on.

Pine needles stabbed into my hands as I scooped handfuls of earth and threw them at him. The last remnants of light faded as my hands brushed fabric. Holding my breath I swept the dirt away, moving up the length of the red fabric. There he was, right where he should be, his open eyes covered in a film of dirt and death. I turned and there he was, standing over me. I couldn't hear what he said, but I could read his lips. ""No one says no to me."""

John wiped his tears and looked up at his friend.

The forest was dark and cold. It seemed like the winter at this place never ends.

""You're right,"" said John standing up. ""We need to bring him to his family. He should be buried next to them.""

He adjusted a rifle hanging on his shoulder. Together, they lifted up the body wrapped in several layers of dirty fabric and headed West. They were not far from the burial grounds.

""I hope we'll be able to give him a proper funeral. The Commander said that his whole village is buried there, so he will rest next to his loved ones."" Said Bertram breathing heavily.

""Yes. Let's drink something after it's done,"" John replied. ""I can't stand it anymore.""

A blinding ray of light made friends stop. Suddenly, they couldn't see anything but heard a motion sound. Then a loud voice pierced the silence.

""Stay still! Drop it on the ground, and put your hands up!""

Quickly but carefully, they put the body on the snow and raised their arms.

""Numbers!"" yelled the voice.

""Private #100826!"" yelled John as loud as he could.

""Private #100501!"" Bertram followed his friend.

Suddenly, the light went off. The friends slowly opened their eyes.

A man in a uniform stood right next to the body they brought. It was the Commander himself.

""Report, private. Are you from the second division? Coming from the East?"" he asked Bertram.

""Yes, sir! This is the villager from Miria. We brought him here for burial. We need to find the...""

""Great!"" interrupted the Commander. Then he yelled loudly, ""Open the gates! They brought the last one!"".

John sighed in relief.

""Finally, we'll give him a proper funeral,"" he said.

Massive metal gates began to open with a loud screeching sound. A cloud of heavy smoke was hanging in the thick air. Soon the friends were surrounded by dozens of military men - all were cheering, laughing, and shooting in the sky.

""It's over! We won!"" could be heard everywhere.

The Commander pointed at the opened gates.

""You'll find the cemetery there,"" he said smiling. ""Thank you for your service, soldiers.""

The friends lifted up the body and walked into the gates. A heavy smoke surrounded them, and it became hard to breathe and see.

""What's that?.."" asked John quietly. Suddenly, he screamed in terror.

They were standing on the edge of a giant pit. The pit was so deep, they couldn't see the bottom. Bodies... Mountains of bodies were piling up all over the pit. Men, women, children, elders. Fire could be seen in some places. Enormous fans were working fast, eliminating the smell.

""Throw it in, the war is over! You brought the last one! The land is ours!"" someone yelled cheerfully.

Shaking, Bertram pulled out his gun and put it to his temple. Tears were running down his cheeks."

That’s what they called it, our basement. The Chapel Below. Like naming it that would change the nature of what it was.

They’d throw me to the ground, chain me up before the cross, and then, uh, then they’d put the mask on. 

It enveloped my skull perfectly. Needles digging into skin - making sure I’d never move, never close my eyes, never avert my gaze, lest I wanted them all holey-like and pulled out with the mask. A long metal bar attached at back of my head kept my neck up at *juuuuust* the right angle.

So I could see. So I could behold.

*For the Glory,* they’d say.

Sometimes it took mere minutes. Sometimes excruciating hours. Sometimes they kept me down there for days at the time. To hear the screams. To witness every lash of the whip. To watch as thick streams of blood poured down the cross.

*For the Glory of Your Redeemer.*

*Can you see it?* my father would ask. 

I saw the terror in their eyes. I heard the torment in their guttural shrieks. I felt their dying breath on my face. How many? Too many to count. Yet I remember them all. Every last one. Every face. Every voice.

Every Redeemer, like flesh puppets for my parents to twist and mangle and warp beyond recognition.

One of them fell apart at the seams, did I tell you that? Tiny thing he was, couldn’t have been older than five or six years old. Limbs weren’t strong enough to hold him up there you see, so on the second day they just…gave in.

*Can you see it?*

He lived for another day or so, little but a head on a torso. They lifted him back up and tied him to that cross, and then they whipped and they lashed and they prodded and they stabbed, until there was nothing left to whip or lash or prod or stab.

Then they’d remove the mask, and they’d ask me if I’d seen it, and then they’d make me clean the cross and take care of the Redeemers, or whatever was left of them anyway.

My answer was always the same though.

*Did you see it?*

Yes, I saw it. I saw it every time. Every eternity hidden in every second hidden in every moment. It takes a special eye, you see. Blink, and you’ll miss it. Miss HIS message, shrouded in the pain and the fear and the screams and the torture. HIS manifesto, for all of us to learn, but just a handful of us to document.

That’s why you’re here. I have grown old and weary, and my eyes cannot bear witness anymore. So, my son, I will need you to pay close attention as I hammer in the nails. 

You know now what you must do.

Behold, boy. Witness.

I woke, or perhaps just roused from ease, suckling like a swaddled babe. My lips pursed and pulled without thirst, an instinct without evolutionary wisdom, for which I was rewarded with frigid gouts of slippery brine. My head swam, the soft pulsing squeeze of worldly neglect pulling my conscious—uh—brain goop (*goop?…fuck*) down and 

down 

&nbsp;

and

&nbsp;

^down

into the hollow gulping depths of the sea. 

But maybe that was just the booze talking…or the lack of oxygen. I heard Grigori shout something before I climbed the ladder to the high dive. It sounded like “There goes father Indra—clucking fool!” Grigori was prone to fanciful outbursts like that when I was fucked up. 

I didn’t pay him any mind. I jumped and tucked and slid into the warm water like a drop of summer rain. Graceful as a goddamn swan. 

——
**The Aboleth**

From the darkened depths I watched, swimming through the aether. A drunkard saw my sea below, a swimming hole beneath her. I called to her in silence as a watcher’s wont to do. She heard me as though dreaming and the dream is all she knew. I gave to her the succor of the dark and endless plane. To slake a thirst for vision while the darkness offered pain. 

Now dive, little water fowl, you shan’t fall very far. The sea is here to catch you, ~~pretty morsel~~ falling star. So come and share the deep with me, this salt-parched reservoir. I was seasoning the water, while you pickled at the bar.

I hadn’t realized how fucked Mila was until she climbed the ladder to the high dive. Fifteen feet into a twelve foot deep diving well. She cackled the whole way up, raving about swans and the ocean. As she bounced on the end of the diving board, I shouted, “There’s no water in the fucking pool!”  But she just smiled and shook her head and dove. 

Twenty seven feet onto concrete. I heard her head hit, somewhere between a crunch and a splat, while not truly being either. *Splunch*, maybe. By the time I got down to the bottom, there was a river of blood creeping down the drain. She had landed head first. It was the only time I’ve ever seen an actual human brain. 

She was dead. Well, I guess that’s obvious, but in the dark wet sheen of her open head, I swear, I saw something move. An eye opening from blood-sodden chewed bubble gum mass of her cerebellum."

Criss Seymour Jr. had been born without any particular complications on a mild September afternoon that experienced no harsh weather. Seventeen hours later, after the doctors all convened on the obvious fact that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the boy, he was allowed to go back home to his parents and continue a placid, if somewhat average existence. 

&#x200B;

He would go on to attend preschool at four, middle school at twelve, high school at sixteen, and finally, a local two-year community college at twenty. All the while maintaining a perfectly average score that hinted at neither hidden genius, nor underlying stupidity.

&#x200B;

It wasn't until his twenty-third birthday that he first picked up a guitar, seemingly at random, inadvertently giving birth to his new self. And consequently, his new life: *Groef*.

&#x200B;

Before, he had been nothing, been no one. Destined to live an anonymous life of absolute mediocrity. Born one day. Dead the next.

&#x200B;

But the crowd had changed that for him; choosing him for something far greater.

&#x200B;

A rock god they called Groef. 

&#x200B;

Now, forty years later, he stood on-stage one more time; one last time. His fans a sea of eyes that cried at his sight; an ensemble of mouths chanting his name in holy unison; an army of hands and fingers and palms, all reaching for him, however close or far they might be. 

&#x200B;

He played for them because they were everything.

Because they had given him everything.

Because they had made him everything he was today.

&#x200B;

He’d been born Criss Seymour Jr., but they had christened him Groef through their relentless adoration. Through rehabs and eventual relapses, through marriages and inevitable divorces; they had sided with him; loved him, unconditionally.

&#x200B;

So now, having given them all, Groef edged closer and closer to the fringes of the stage, picking up speed with every step. He was ready to give them what was left of his person. Launching himself off stage, he dove into the crowd below head-first.

&#x200B;

Within seconds, they welcomed him with a hundred hands, caressing his features at first, gently combing his hair and pulling at his clothes. But in their haste, some of the fabric tore, revealing more of him under it.

&#x200B;

More to collect.

&#x200B;

Soon, there was not an inch of his body that wasn't theirs to love. 

&#x200B;

To touch with their very own hands.

&#x200B;

To finally own for themselves after years of untold veneration.

&#x200B;

Here was their god.

&#x200B;

Groef.

&#x200B;

He was theirs, and they were his.

&#x200B;

They kissed him, and kisses promptly became chomps as they sank their teeth into him.   

&#x200B;

They pulled him apart, limb from limb, sinew by sinew. Drinking from his blood; eating from his flesh.

&#x200B;

It was a magnificent feast; every one of them had their fill. Only Groef didn't scream, he never begged; no curses left his mouth. Once, they had given him their each and everything, so now, as the curtain of his life finally came to a close, he, in turn, gave them his all."

It was a casual outing with friends that day, friends of mine were just like me, we were a ruthless gang. Enroute we saw a woman who was standing at the middle of the road... The road onto which we were travelling was too narrow and at both sides were railing, it was a cliff. 

I was the one driving hence I blowed the horn in continuity but to no avail, she didn't seem in the mood to step aside. 

Finally I stopped the car just a feet away from her and stepped out of the car... I yelled at her and the very next moment she attacked me... She scratched my face with her long nails... She then tried to choke me to death, I had no option left in self defence but to take my gun out and so I did. I killed her, I had to fire otherwise she'd have killed me...whilst in pain she pulled me towards her and kissed me... I was intrigued... It was kinda shocking and disturbing... 

We drove away from there, I had already informed the police. Whilst driving my nails seemed to have grown a bit larger, I had cut them just a day before the incident, I didn't mind and moved on. 

We'd travelled quite far from the city hence decided to rest in a motel we happened to have seen enroute... 

The sense of being 'Peter' that is me was slowly being lost.... When Rebecca called my name I was like 'Peter?' who's Peter... 

We all slept after a tiresome and fearful day... At night I woke up and sat in front of the mirror installed in our room, I saw a beautiful young lady in the mirror... By this time the sense of being 'ME' was almost lost, some text appeared on the mirror which read, 

'Just a kiss it takes to transform thee, into the beautiful version which once was me, which I time and again lose to the laws of nature, as I grow old I rediscover my stature. By kissing the person he or she, they shall transform into the beauty I always will be, just a cell it takes which I leave, on the lip of the person who then I live'"

the moon domes are pretty much what the name implies. giant domes on the surface of the moon. within the domes are cities the size of new york. they have everything that humans could need. there are big cities full of buildings, restaurants, theaters, and other such things. however, for those who prefer the simple life, there are also suburb esk places within the dome for people to live as well. the domes are filled with the life sustaining oxygen that the people of earth so often take for granted. there are a total of six moon domes that were built on the surface of the moon. they are named moon dome 1, moon dome 2, moon dome 3, moon dome 4, moon dome 5, and of course moon dome 6. each of them are the same size and width. the only difference between the six is that the cities and suburbs within look slightly different.

after the domes were built, the moon was deemed safe for humans to live on. as such, people began to move to the domes to start a new life for themselves and their families. everything was going fine...until...

large claw marks were found outside moon dome 4. it was then that the people within the domes started to question if the moon truly was safe...and if they were truly alone on the moon."

Ofc I have the Heebie jeebies and start to have a aniexty attack but what do you expect being alone walking in the dark. So I’m walking and I start to get that feeling someone is behind me, I pick up my speed and clutch my work bag. Trying to peak through the corner of my eye to see if someone is behind me I trip over me feet and face plant into the sidewalk. I almost knocked myself out but manage to get back up and gather all my things. As I try to stand up and man is in front of me with his hand out trying to help. He is very handsome looking guy. He had a cast on his arm, driving a yellowish buggy. As I get up and brush myself off he ask if I could help him put some boxes in his car. I felt bad for the dude so I helped him. As I’m setting the first big box in the bag of his car I’m suddenly being strangled. Everything goes black.
I wake up to find myself being dumped right by the woods. I get up looking around trying to find some sort of humanity to get help. No one is to be seen then I get a good glimpse of something. There is a body on the ground. Headless. I freak out and start throwing up but I noticed something about the body…we have the same tattoo, same painted finger nails, and same clothes. It’s me. It’s my body on the ground. I’m dead. The guy had cut my head off. Not a very clean cut if I say so myself. Did I mention that it was 1974?"

Second, you don’t believe in god, and you do not let that man get under your skin. And third…” she gave a slow chuckle and looped her arms round his neck “you clean up quite nicely yourself darling”. She gave him a deep kiss, a promise of delights to come if he behaved himself at this stupid department dinner.

But things started well enough. Laura was gracious to Monique, showing deep interest in her hometown, and making lots of promises about getting together again soon for coffee and profuse apologies for not having done so earlier “so busy, you know, I kept telling John”. 

As the department Chair’s fine wine started to flow, things loosened up, and guffaws of laughter could be heard as old insider jokes were wheeled out. Colin loosened his tie and just as he let his guard down, John said it for the first time that evening. Affirmative Action. 

Colin took an extra big sip of wine. John hadn’t been even talking to him, but he was talking loudly enough. Monique heard it too, and looked over with a little shake of her beautifully coiffed head, laying her hand on his thigh. 

John was talking faster and louder. Then he said it again- in the same sentence as “academic freedom”. The Iranian prof nodded, and glanced over at Colin, a quizzical look in his sad dark eyes. 

Colin forgot he was an atheist, and sent up a desperate prayer of help, which happened to land just right.

“…and they ask for your ethnicity on grant applications! Why? Why do they need to know the colour of your skin to know if you can do research? Huh?” John’s voice was surprisingly loud, for a polite dinner party. 

The Iranian prof shrugged helplessly and stabbed a piece of chicken.

“I am telling you, Affirmative Action…”

A silent bolt of fire came from nowhere and consumed John with a flash. His chair was empty save a pile of ashes. 

The profs and their spouses looked at each other, and then continued eating."

My daughter wrote to Santa last year. A list as short as the elf is tall. She wanted two things. An elf on the shelf and a pony. 

Suffice it to say, I wasn't going to buy her a pony. We didn't have a paddock and I didn't have the money or time to care for such a thing. But that didn't stop one showing up. 

The elf showed up on Dec 1st. A ragtag scruffy thing with burnt clothes missing one eye and a wicked grin on its face. My wife said she didn't buy the thing when it turned up on top of our refrigerator. 

Bella loved it instantly. What could I do? That night leading to Dec 2, we heard something moving around the house. Light went on, I went in search. I found flour spread out on the kitchen surface. One of Bella's dolls tied at the wrist and ankles amidst the carnage of white. The elf beside it with a steak knife. 

Not wanting Bella to see it in the morning, I rearranged the elf in the flour like a snow angel and went back to bed slightly shaken. I couldn't explain it. 

Over the course of December, I found that horrid thing doing unspeakable things to Bella's other toys. Barbie's stripped and hanging from ceiling fans. Her puppy teddy shaved of its fur. Books shredded and rearranged into a giant figure with a gaping hole in its chest like a wicker man. 

But on Christmas day, something  more terrifying happened. The pony arrived. A charred brown thing with larvae wiggling in cutaneous tissue along its neck. Hoofs broken and bleeding. 

Bella loved it unconditionally. We were horrified. Puzzled by the find, my wife and I returned inside to discuss what we could do. We found the elf up on the Christmas tree. A note in its blackened hands. 

*Dear Bella. Santa has forsaken you. But I didn't. I hope you like my infected pony. He will bring you to me. I have so many more devilish toys to show you. Satan.*

Cold dread crept up my spine as I raced outside. The pony was nowhere to be found. Fiery hoof print led away from the house and disappeared mid way. 

There's only one thing I want this Christmas. I want my child back."

Both the mother and sister just looked and smiled at her which made her feel more uneasy, she finished eating and something came to her mind ""Where's father?"" and again, there was no response

The unfamiliar voice came back and as before it asked ""What do you fear the most?"" The girl answered ""I don't know yet"" the voice disappeared again, the girl felt very strange, it was like EVERYTHING was nothing yet nothing is everything she then remembered when she asked her mother about her father, her father that always eats with her and the one who raised her..her father raised her and her father only, while her mother was not with them same as the sister, the voice came back and said ""Yes, this is all an illusion"" the girl asked ""What are you? Who are you?"" Everything turned black while the voice said ""You can not get away from the one who created this illusion, it is after all made by your own mind, now tell me , What do you fear the most?"" The girl answered ""..My mind"" 

One's mind is scary, although it might not seem like it but their own mind can make an illusion, an illusion you can't escape, it can also trick you, what if this is just an illusion, an illusion made by your own mind."

The grotesque swell to the belly, the unnatural writhing, my indescribable pain—I was panicked, but I knew it was up to me. I had to do it. No one else seemed to have the spine to offer anything more than assistance.

*Clinically* . . . I had to think clinically. And I had to move fast, had to take the knife and cut—yet I had to be careful not to cut too deep. To cut too deep would mean certain disaster, wouldn’t it. I had to shut everything down; I had to shut off the lights in all my rooms except the one where I would cut. *I had to ignore my pain . . . exit the moment . . . had to proceed*.

I took the knife and placed its blade on the belly, then I pressed and dragged—not too hard, but firm. The layers cut more easily than I’d imagined, and my incision was true. Still, *no time to waste* . . . *had to keep moving*. I pulled back the layers and reached deep into the belly. He was right there, *my child, my son* . . . I held him in my hands inside the belly, then I pulled him through the viscera, the muscle, the skin.

I held him in my arms, covered in blood as he was, eyes half opened staring at nothing. Of course he was dead, just as they’d said he’d be. *I held him . . . and I wailed . . . and wailed . . .*

*I hated* . . . I hated my husband for making us come to the Amazon with him, hated myself for not refusing to come. I hated that I’d looked away, even though it’d only been for the slightest of moments. And though the beast hadn’t acted out of malevolence as my heart told me it surely must’ve, but only out of its instinct to survive . . . I hated the anaconda, too. *My boy, my little James . . . he was just two . . .*"

The crust of the earth slowly broke apart, the ground violently shook. Our bodies came together scared and worried that the earth would swallow us up. The Trees brushing violently with the wind, in the distance strong sun rays shot through the sky. Leading us to our way out. We ran to the opening and stood there directly under the sunlight realizing that there was no way out. There we stood stranded in the sunlight for eternity waiting for the fog to disappear.

How many times did he have to tell him to just leave the paper on the door step!? Everyday the idiot would ring the doorbell and wait for an answer. He’d stand there like a dummy and try to make small talk, he even had the nerve to ask if the old man needed help with anything. Last time he brought the paper, he’d really let him have it. The old man had screamed at him until the pansy had cried and ran away. Good riddance. The old man had let the screen door slap shut behind him. He turned around, caught his toe on the rug in the entryway, and had fallen. He’d spent hours trying to raise from the ground or crawl to the phone, but it was futile. So, he laid there, fallen.

Once he accepted his fate, he reminisced. It was ironic. His whole life had been a series of fallings. He had fallen in love, fallen from grace, he’d suffered falling outs, loved ones had fallen ill. Now, he’d fallen over the rug his late wife had fallen in love with. 
He’d hated it and thought it too expensive, but it’d made her happy, so he’d fallen for it. In fact he’d had an argument with his daughter a week prior about the damned thing. She’d suggested removing it so he wouldn’t trip over it. He accused her of trying to take one of the last things he had of value. The argument that proceeded had been explosive. She’d left sobbing as he yelled after her not to contact him again. She didn’t. So, he supposed this was all his fault, but wished it wasn’t so painful. He wished he could change things, but knew it was too late. He wished he wasn’t going to die alone. It scared him. 

He laid there for probably days. His mouth grew dry and his pain increased. Then he heard footsteps up his walkway. He used the last of his strength to twist his head towards the door. He saw the silhouette of the paperboy through the screen door. He reached towards the doorbell, but then stopped. The old man heard the thump of the newspaper on his front stoop and footsteps receding. He took a ragged breath and let the tears fall until he had fallen out of consciousness."

This time, he does not speak at the Strange Masters. Terrence has learned his lesson. Terrence isn’t the same as was before the Strange Masters came. 

Before, whenever Terrence had seen other masters pass his house, he would speak at them. “Go! Go! Go away! Go away! Go!” he would often say. Actually, Terrence *always* spoke when other masters were outside the house. 

But then his Master Jon would say, “It’s all right, Terrence! Be quiet, Terrence!” He loved Master Jon. Sometimes Terrence would listen to Master Jon, but it was hard. He just wanted his masters to be safe: Master Jon, Master Kate, and the two Little Masters. Terrence loved all his masters very much. 

They had lived together, happily, for a long time. Terrence protected them. He always let his masters know when something was different. If it wasn’t for Terrence speaking, more of the other masters would have come and bothered his masters, as they huddled around their light and noise boxes. 

But then the Strange Masters came. 

When Terrence told the Strange Masters to go away, they hadn’t listened. It was the opposite: when they heard Terrence, the Strange Masters began moving *toward* his voice. He spoke at them very much, saying loudly, “Go away! Go...go go go AWAY! Go!” 

But they kept coming. 

Terrence could tell there was something different about these masters. It was almost like they weren’t masters. They looked kind of like masters, but they made strange noises and smelled bad. They walked differently, almost like little masters. 

Master Jon and Master Kate had covered Terrence’s mouth to make him quiet. That had not happened to Terrence before. His masters were scared; the Little Masters were crying. The Strange Masters crashed through the door and windows. They were definitely not like his masters. 

They were hungry.

Terrified, Terrence hid under the bed when Master Jon got the bang stick. When he came back out, there was blood all over the ground. It was everywhere. There was no more Master Kate. There were no more Little Masters. Master Jon had stopped the Strange Masters, but he was hurt in his arm. His hurt smelled like the Strange Masters. 

Not long after the Strange Masters left, Master Jon became very sick. He has been in his bed. Terrence is quiet now; so is Master Jon. 

A sudden shuffling noise behind Terrence distracts him from the Strange Masters outside. It’s coming from Master Jon’s room! Terrence begins wagging his tail slowly, as he waits for his master. But something is wrong. Master Jon smells wrong. He sounds wrong. He smells and sounds like the Strange Masters now. 

Terrence growls, long and low. He hesitates, then speaks fiercely at Master Jon, “Go! Go away!” 

Master Jon doesn’t listen. He keeps coming. Outside, Terrence hears the Strange Masters begin their approach up the man-path..."

My younger sister Daphne tucked her feet in every night, terrified that something would drag her under if she left them uncovered. I starfished, fingers and toes fearlessly hanging over the edge. I knew that *I* had nothing to fear. Daphne tried to warn me, signing furiously that I would get stolen away by monsters, but I laughed her off and insisted there were no such dangers. We were both staying right here. She gave me the silently exaggerated angry face she always made when someone wasn’t taking her seriously, so I ruffled her pale hair and let the issue drop.

There was no monster for me under those beds. She was so convinced there was.

The first night I spent alone in my new college dorm, I slept without blankets, the remnants of the August heat pressing its palms against the glass of my window and homesickness sitting heavy in my stomach. The mattress was narrower than I was used to, and my entire forearm abandoned the constraints of the sheets and hung freely off the side of the bed. 

When I woke up, it wasn’t to my alarm clock.

Something feathery-light ran down my arm and I froze, startled out of my half-asleep muddle. The touch was gentle, soft, and utterly terrifying. I must’ve given some sign I was awake because it withdrew abruptly. Something was listening. I didn’t dare utter a sound. I tried to make myself breathe evenly, but the air was caught in my lungs. 

It knew I was awake. It took its barely substantial hand and pressed a letter into my palm. The signs my sister had taught me for years were replicated in the ghostly fingers under my bed, and I held my breath as I counted out the letters in my head. 

***LET***

***ME***

***GO***

***IN***

***PEACE***

I squeezed my eyes shut. I knew what it was saying, but I couldn't. I loved her. 

“No,” I whispered.

***PLEASE***

It had only been a month since she left her old place after enduring two years of toxicity that masked itself as love. After all the hell, Kim had finally found heaven. 

Waitressing came as a salvation as she waited for callbacks from all the job interviews she had gone through. The owners of the family owned cafe were kind enough to give her a shot and even kinder as to cut her rent in half just until she could fully get back to her feet. 

The thought of that warmed Kim as she cantered the almost desolate street with her body begging for bed. Her eyes darted upwards and saw how even the moon was kind to her, its light beaming on her every step. 

A familiar ache of her feet prompted Kim to take the shortcut to her rented place and as she turned the corner to walk on a new path the sound of her phone dying filled her ears. 

Kim felt assured still as she saw another woman walking ahead of her, the clothing wasn't clear but the figure screamed feminine.

The longing for rest only got bigger as she saw the familiar windows of her home not far from where she stood.

The tranquility was finally broken when the woman suddenly threw something aside and sprinted away.  

A baby's cry echoed in the atmosphere as Kim ran towards it all the while yelling for the woman to stop, only for that person to run even faster. The little one was bundled in a white sheet, its tear-strickened face broke the girl's heart as she couldn't process just how cruelty could be done to something so innocent. 

As kindness clothed Kim when she needed it the most, she decided that it was time to give back with the intention of taking the baby home and then calling the authorities to report everything. 

It wasn't long before Kim felt a shift in the air, a shift that told her gut that something was clearly wrong. 

The baby got heavier and heavier and no matter how fast she walked, Kim wasn't advancing at all. A cry that broke her heart in the first place turned to one that made her stomach drop when it slowly started to sound into a demonic laugh. 

Kim didn't even dare to look down at what she was carrying, fear made her throw the thing aside as she ran and what made her run even faster was when she heard her own voice yelling at her to stop."

Should this news shock the upright and moral conscience of the goodly reader, let another truth be known:— their fascination has turned to sinful industry. Indeed, they are making smut as well!  

The present generation has donned the vestments of vice and left all else on the boudoir floor. They are, one and all, vainglorious purveyors of prurient exhibition, pimping their own meretricious malfeasance for the world to see. And the wages of their sin? A like, a click or an upvote—the accolade of the sex-addled peep show reprobate. 

Mired thusly in this sorry state of our declining societal virtue, I make my plea for common decency:

Cleanse this filth in the fire of the public square lest your children’s souls be soot-stained in the fires of hell. 

In a bygone era, one respecting and fearful of the outrage of God, men and women given to the devil’s grip were burned at the stake to rid the community of their infectious machinations. My call is not so rash as this, for we have learned from the barbarism of the past, our moral crop renewed from the ash of yesteryear. 

Ours is an epidemic spread among the gathered perusers of a media marketplace, a digital bordello of peddled flesh. To heal the body and indeed the soul, you need look no further than the words of Christ:

*And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.*

Christ knew of sacrifice, to be certain, the submission to destiny that paves a blood-dappled path to salvation. But He also knew of restraint. 

Were a wandering eye the root of our growing moral decay, we should have a clear solution. But in truth, the direction of His message is unmuddied by the soiled compass of our modern age. 

The parched hollow of the “thirst trap” offends. The critical mass of a million instagrams offends. The perfumed breeze of onlyfans offends. 

The flesh offends. 

Cut it away and cast it from the altar of temptation.

When I was 18 I had no choice but to join the family business which was killing, stealing and torturing. My father told me which body part of my body I would like to get chopped off and put into a fridge to stop it from decaying, this will be the only innocent piece of my body for years to come. Every member of my family has chopped off one of their arms and thier chopped off limbs is the ​only innocent part of their body. 

At first I couldn't decide whether to chop off my arm or a leg but in the end I decided to chop off my left arm and had gotten a sharp knife as a hook sort of thing to fit into my left arm as a replacement. After all of that I had murdered, stole and ruined so many people's lives in the name of the family business but after a hard days work, I would open up the fridge to look at my left arm which is still innocent and free of any sins.

I wished that I was as innocent as my left arm and clean of any filth and dirt. My left arm is a reminder of who I use to be and how happy I use to be when I didn't join the family business. You can even say that my left arm is still a virgin and how I wish that I could be like my left arm again. The atrocities that I put my whole body through and the things my body had to witness, my left arm is so lucky. 

The real reason my family chop off one of their limbs to be kept innocent when they go into the horrid sinful line of work, is because when hell decides to randomly take us to hell, heaven also randomly decides to take our innocent chopped off limbs to heaven. 

So we all hold onto our innocent limbs and then both heaven and hell can neither pull up or drag down either of us, and they give up. What if though I had two innocent chopped off limbs to hold onto, it will give heaven a more stronger pull. So I stole my cousin's chopped off arm and so when heaven and hell decide to act on us, I have two two chopped off innocent sinless limbs to hold onto. 

My cousin is freaking out."

Violence towards women, animals or anyone he deemed under him, he never saw the evil within it. At the height of his brutality, he murdered a Hells-Angels in cold blood during a drug deal gone bad. He served time for it, but he felt no remorse. That's what the world was to him, it's either you or them.

Reaching older age, he started worrying and wondered what the after life would hold for him, having lead such a life of violence, crime and brutality.

Suddenly, the idea of repentence seemed appealing. And so he opened up his arms to God. He poured out his sins, as to be forgiven. And so he felt clean, as if nothing more was standing in the way of his eternal peaceful life.

It's believed that our last judgement is based upon the character of our souls. We can, in our thoughts be forgiven, but can the soul truly forget the actions which were carried out at the hands of its vessel?

Lying on his death bed all alone, he was at peace knowing the Father had absolved him of his past sins. When the time came, a figure not of this world appeared to him. He was not frightened, as he knew this must be his end. 

""I guess you're here to bring me up to heaven aren't you? That's what you angels do right?"" he said almost jokingly. The being looked at him with a smile that was just a bit too big.

""Now see, that's the funny part about you humans, you always associate angels solely with heaven."" It spoke with a deep voice that didn't sound quite so divine.

He noticed, with panic slowly forming, that the being was steadily becoming more distorted with every passing second.

Out of the darkness where the face had just been, it spoke the words which sealed his fate. ""My friend, surely you've heard of my kind before? No? Why, there's quite a famous motorcycle gang named after us, ironic isn't it?""."

Nobody seemed to notice him except for me. He was clothed in white, and shone with an unearthly light. He had the most beautiful sky-blue eyes I had ever seen, a brilliant smile with pearly white teeth, and silky dove wings stretching out behind him.

“Hello, Isaac,” he sang. “I’m your guardian angel, Gabriel. Happy birthday!”

My jaw dropped. The angel winked at me. “Don’t worry. I’ll be here to guide you through your teenage years. We’ll be the best of friends!”

And he was right. We did become the best of friends. For a deity from heaven, he surprisingly knew a lot about pop culture and the latest trends. We spent hours late at night, chatting away. I would tell him about my day, and he would listen soulfully and respond with advice.

One day he showed me a vision of me dead on the floor, my parents standing around with knives and sadistic smiles on their faces.

“I know the future,” he said. “Trust me.”

However, my hands were shaking, my face deathly pale, as I executed Gabriel’s plan. I got the smallest knife I found and sneaked up to my parent’s room and slit their throat. Warm blood trickled downwards and stained everything crimson.

I got off scot-free thanks to Gabriel, who must have used his powers to clean everything up. But guilt wore down heavily on me like I was carrying all the sins of the world. I couldn’t sleep; I couldn’t eat. I tried seeing people for my problems. I tried to settle down with somebody to love, but every time a few months later, Gabriel would convince me, with visions as proof, that there was something wrong with them.

It was no surprise then that I died, alone and lonely, on a cold winter’s day, without anybody to remember me. I woke up though, in a room where fire and wild shadows were dancing on the wall. Mom and Dad and everybody else I once loved and killed stared back at me, anger haunting their faces.

Then a voice from the heavens boomed, “For every sin and murder you committed, it would be repaid twice as heavily to you.”

“I was trying to protect myself!” I sobbed. “My guardian angel, Gabriel, said I would die if I don’t!”

“Guardian angel? Gabriel?” said the voice blankly. “What are you talking about?”

Realization dawned upon me. As the horde of victims stormed towards me, hands reaching out for my throat, the shadows parted and Gabriel’s face appeared on the wall.

He cracked a sinister, victorious smile."

After having had my work done at the cold storage nearby college I went home. There were a few people standing outside asking for my dad 'Mr Jacob' as they addressed him. I asked 'Yes'.... 

I solved their problems better than how Dad used to.

I always wanted to have her but she didn't like me at all, the real me although was hated by almost everyone and for the same reason I had visited uncle Charlie who was an occultist, he was the one who'd bestowed me with the power to become like any person I wish to just by consuming their flesh, luckily my dad had a cold storage into which I used to store the body of all those who I had murdered, all was needed after that was to consume the flesh of the ones who I killed, and you may by now have understood that it was me and not dad who mom had kissed, I was looking exactly like Dad but wasn't him. 

It's my step sister now who I want to have and here I'm consuming Zack's flesh..."
