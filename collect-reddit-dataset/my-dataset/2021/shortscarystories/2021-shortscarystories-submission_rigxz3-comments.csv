hoxg5m2,t3_rigxz3,"I was expecting it to be a puppy until the shiny red sticker was mentioned. 
Would love a follow up to see how they fuck the guy up",t3_rigxz3
hoxex65,t3_rigxz3,"I initially thought it was about dogs, never expected it to be about books, awesome!",t3_rigxz3
hoy8xyq,t3_rigxz3,"As a librarian who constantly has to care for poor abused books, I love this on a visceral level.

I bet all our patrons who get sand in the book jackets would think twice if this was the reality.",t3_rigxz3
hoxmnqc,t3_rigxz3,"I have never read a story like this! good job OP, and thank you! so unexpeceted.",t3_rigxz3
hoy1ws3,t3_rigxz3,"*The title reads: Gone Girl.*

That’s a great reference. And a super fun, original story! Nicely done!",t3_rigxz3
hoxww8l,t3_rigxz3,"I was picturing the protagonist as a teddy bear all the way until the spine comment! Very cool idea, I really enjoyed it!",t3_rigxz3
hoy0b5n,t3_rigxz3,"Definitely good misdirection. I was like everyone else. Initially it was a person, then animals, maybe a doll or something, and finally to a book once it said jacket. Great story!",t3_rigxz3
hoyr0on,t3_rigxz3,Nice story. Could someone explain the significance of the other book being Gone Girl? Thank,t3_rigxz3
hoy4n2g,t3_rigxz3,"I was fooled, I admit it. Very well played! As a die hard book lover, I found this **very** satisfying.",t3_rigxz3
hoy9gsk,t3_rigxz3,I honestly thought it was a girl until he sticker. I wanna see how they treat him.,t3_rigxz3
hoycgwv,t3_rigxz3,"I need another installment, OP!  Bravo!!",t3_rigxz3
hoyjk33,t3_rigxz3,"Never seen a perspective like this before, I love it!! I really didn’t know what to expect",t3_rigxz3
hozfafp,t3_rigxz3,so what was the mother? the bookcase?,t3_rigxz3
hp15snp,t3_rigxz3,"That was honestly so genius ;0!! You fooled me multiple times, then hit me with that incredible twist.",t3_rigxz3
hp1gq44,t3_rigxz3,Damn this was good!,t3_rigxz3
hoxr90q,t3_rigxz3,"Ah the old switcheroo!  To see a protagonist turn into a goldfish, visit r/jgcreepypastas or for a transmogrification into something a little different, visit r/thecrypticcompendium 🤓",t3_rigxz3
hoz4fp7,t3_rigxz3,What a twist! Great story!,t3_rigxz3
hoz72ji,t3_rigxz3,Oh shit if this happens I am fuuuuuuuuuucked.,t3_rigxz3
hozm4el,t3_rigxz3,He’s about to get the Sid from Toy Story treatment but with books,t3_rigxz3
hozqbt8,t3_rigxz3,I never knew I needed to see this today until I read it! Amazing. Thank you!,t3_rigxz3
hozt2z5,t3_rigxz3,"Not sure why, but my first thought was that it was a doll. Then a puppy. Then a book.

Books really know how to teach a lesson.",t3_rigxz3
hozxlvu,t3_rigxz3,"I thought slavery, then dogs, then dolls, then maybe houseplants, and then dolls again until finally plants! A wild ride!",t3_rigxz3
hp01ir7,t3_rigxz3,My 13-year old paperback copy of Order of the Phoenix with its cover torn off and now split in half at the seams be like…,t3_rigxz3
hp02uxi,t3_rigxz3,I would never destroy my books like this. I literally keep them on my shelf even after I'm done reading,t3_rigxz3
hp09key,t3_rigxz3,Noice,t3_rigxz3
hp0hc8t,t3_rigxz3,Great story!,t3_rigxz3
hp0qstd,t3_rigxz3,"As soon as I got to spine, I had figured out it was about books. Well done.",t3_rigxz3
hp13zxd,t3_rigxz3,I'm working in bookstore. Right now I do not want go to job even more :D,t3_rigxz3
hoz9vcz,t1_hoxex65,I've never been so relieved,t3_rigxz3
hoyy2v3,t1_hoy8xyq,Oh I can only imagine.  I've lent out a few books to people only to have them come back very much destroyed or not come back at all.  I'd almost prefer the latter.  It's pretty sad to see a good book get beat up like that.  Glad you enjoyed the story!,t3_rigxz3
hp03pjq,t1_hoy8xyq,Right there with you.  Former bookstore worker.  I loved my books and helping them go to hopefully good homes.,t3_rigxz3
hoz7vm2,t1_hoxmnqc,Thank you!,t3_rigxz3
hoyy5g2,t1_hoy1ws3,Thank you!  Glad you enjoyed it 🙂,t3_rigxz3

hoyy3qy,t1_hoxww8l,Thanks!,t3_rigxz3
hoyxrh8,t1_hoy0b5n,Thank you!  Glad you enjoyed it 🙂,t3_rigxz3
hoysz0b,t1_hoyr0on,Spoiler alert! Lol it's about a woman who pretends to be dead but actually is alive and frames her husband to make it look like he killed her. It's based on a great book by the same name.,t3_rigxz3
hozl8me,t1_hoy4n2g,A saying in my house ‘we respect books in this house!’,t3_rigxz3
hoyy8q5,t1_hoycgwv,Cheers! Thank you for reading 🙂,t3_rigxz3
hoyy9pa,t1_hoyjk33,Thanks!,t3_rigxz3
hozh5v4,t1_hozfafp,I was kinda thinking like a first edition or something like that but yeah the bookcase definitely works too lol I actually like that better.,t3_rigxz3
hozmdq7,t1_hozfafp,I assumed it meant the book’s author,t3_rigxz3
hp04ino,t1_hoz9vcz,"Same here, I cant handle dog abuse.",t3_rigxz3
hozu2ok,t1_hoyy2v3,"I have owned four novels by Mary Higgins Clark for more than a decade now. They were paperbacks, second-hand purchases, clearly well-loved. I once lent _Loves Music, Loves To Dance_ to a friend, who returned it three weeks later after asking, requesting, and pleading. When I got it back, it was missing the front and back covers, along with an ""About The Author"" page at the end. It broke my heart, still does, to see the book like that. The idiot girl just shrugged when I asked her what happened. I've always wondered if something she ever loved was ruined like that and got a shrug for her troubles.",t3_rigxz3
hp17b42,t1_hoyy2v3,"This pains me on a very personal level. I once loaned out an Edgar Allen Poe book to someone just to have them give it back to me with the spine ripped. I had returned all the borrowed things to them in nice condition with a pretty bag, and they destroyed my book…. Needless to say I’ve never loaned out a book since!",t3_rigxz3
hoz837t,t1_hoz7vm2,You’re so welcome!! This is truly unique and you deserve to hear it !! <3,t3_rigxz3
hozg8hm,t1_hoyigra,Horror stories are a very important part of anthropology. This is research,t3_rigxz3
hp13p7f,t1_hozh5v4,"ahh yea i considered the author but the story read as if the narrator was in the company of the mother still. plus, most humans are able to talk :p",t3_rigxz3
hp4vq5g,t1_hozh5v4,"Why would a bookcase or a first edition be the mother? If a book has a “mother”, it’s the author. Bookcase would be more like it’s house. I also don’t really get how a book would have thoughts or feelings that aren’t written in the book. I assume the other copies at the bookshop are the siblings? Why is the shop owner judging her customer’s worth? It’s a mass produced best seller. OH. Is that why? Does she think he has bad taste? Presumably, it’s not a used book store. Young must mean newly printed, right? Does anyone ever haggle over the price of new books? Do bookstores even exist anymore? So many questions",t3_rigxz3
hp1t2eh,t1_hozg8hm,👏 you tell them corkkiyo. good luck on your anthropological pursuits,t3_rigxz3
