hmn3aqt,t1_hmmvps3,"John and David work in a morgue. There's a killer on the loose. While they're working on a corpse, another corpse has a post-mortem spasm, which only occur shortly after death, so it has been killed recently. 
The killer is presumed to work in the medical field.
David starts to realize that John is the killer.",t3_r52zxn
