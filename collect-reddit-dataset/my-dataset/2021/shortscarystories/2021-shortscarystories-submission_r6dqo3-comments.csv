hmufhlz,t3_r6dqo3,"honestly, you portraid severe ocd in a cool way i guess you could say? because it's scary how bad it can get, and it's worse when it effects others. one of my biggest fears is that I might effect others because of my ocd (I'm diagnosed dw lol) I also scratch my skin and wash all.the.time. because I just feel gross, so I found this disturbing in the perfect way",t3_r6dqo3
