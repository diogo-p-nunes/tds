hkpzmsz,t1_hkpupo6,"According to the legend, a poor boy called Ming (I think) who was also a budding artist was given a magic paintbrush by an old man. He used the paintbrush to help other people, especially the poor.  One day, the emperor heard about him and ordered him brought to the palace. Then he ordered Ming to draw him a pot of gold.

Ming complied, but the emperor got even more greedy and demanded he draw more riches. Ming was disgusted by his greed and drew an island full of gold, then an ocean and then a ship. When the emperor and his lackeys got on board the ship, the waves became rough and they drowned in the ocean. As for Ming, he got the riches, drew a horse, and rode off into the sunset.

That's all I remember. I first heard this when I was 5 years old and haven't really looked into it since, so forgive me if I have details wrong.",t3_quflph
hkqa3mh,t1_hkpzmsz,"Wow, yup! Lots of old tales relate to greed in that matter! That would definitely be a nice bedtime story as well!",t3_quflph
