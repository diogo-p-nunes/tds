hldi51e,t3_qy24qs,"It's scary how plausible this really is. You know, with so much people saying about babies (babies!) that they look overweight.",t3_qy24qs
hldldum,t3_qy24qs,"This is it. This is the one that really got to me. Some parents actually do this, and I stare at my baby, I can’t imagine doing that to a child.",t3_qy24qs
hlgdfty,t3_qy24qs,"One of my adoptive sisters put her toddler on a diet. She got in a lot of trouble for it as well. The child was never overweight, it was all in my sister's head. Luckily she smartened up before her kid lost too much weight and she didn't do any lasting damage. The daughter is in her late teens now and seems ok. I don't talk to that sister anymore.",t3_qy24qs

hle7alj,t3_qy24qs,I actually had a tear fall at the end. I love my 2 kids so much. The terror in this story is real. The emotions I felt were many. If it wasn't written as well as it was I don't think it would have the impact it does. Kudos to you OP. 😥🤬😱👏👏👏,t3_qy24qs
hldl0j5,t3_qy24qs,Scary because some moms do this. The crazed vegans especially. Because milk isn't vegan. Like those people who force their dogs to be vegan. Awful.,t3_qy24qs
hli0cti,t3_qy24qs,This is good. At first I thought it was a teenage girl but when OP referred to baby I was horrified (not that I am saying parents should do that to their teenagers). Really scary.,t3_qy24qs
hnnjfy4,t3_qy24qs,It's as scary as it is dreadful.,t3_qy24qs
hlf0hyq,t1_hldl0j5,I’m vegan and don’t make my dogs eat vegan. Also breast milk from a mother to child is considered vegan. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.,t3_qy24qs
hlglott,t1_hldl0j5,"Most vegans aren't like that, but Reddit sure loves to focus on the ones that are.",t3_qy24qs
