hlzplxs,t3_r1n26i,"Hope everyone likes it, this is my first post on this subreddit. Feel free to give some constructive criticism, but pls don’t be mean about it.",t3_r1n26i
hm0y0fa,t3_r1n26i,Was Jessie naughty? Poor little guy.,t3_r1n26i
hm1124l,t3_r1n26i,"Oh Krampus! Hell yeah. Maybe it's because I’m a big horror nerd, but I immediately knew it was Krampus! Lol.",t3_r1n26i
hm11v2u,t3_r1n26i,"If I could offer a detale that I think would add to the suspense, it would be the draging sound of his rusty chains. I think with the smell of death, it would add to the kid’s confusion and horror.",t3_r1n26i
hlzvvpx,t3_r1n26i,"If I were you I'd have to imagine the only person you'd want to look out for was Jessie. You sorta did him dirty. The rest of us need to stay in bed so whatever that was won't get us. I'm pretty sure that wasn't Santa.

LOL loved the story.",t3_r1n26i
hnnlsv9,t3_r1n26i,The plot seems to be oversimplified; it needs a build-up.,t3_r1n26i
hlzw0t1,t1_hlzvvpx,"Thanks, I was trying to imply it was Krampus, maybe I should be a little more obvious next time? What do you think?",t3_r1n26i
hlzx0jz,t1_hlzw0t1,I immediately thought of Krampus lol,t3_r1n26i
hlzwx9a,t1_hlzw0t1,No I really don't think so. I assumed Krampus but just didn't say so. I truly enjoyed the story exactly as it is.,t3_r1n26i
