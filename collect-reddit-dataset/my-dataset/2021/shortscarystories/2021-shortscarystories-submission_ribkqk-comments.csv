hoxqljh,t1_how1zf2,"Thanks, patty.",t3_ribkqk
howyaa3,t1_howjvv9,"Good one if it's a joke.

However, very good interpretation into today's world on Sophie's choice. I would have been more off if you chose another name. But it's great. And much more justifyed than in the movie.",t3_ribkqk

hp38r4s,t1_hp0ece6,"Thanks, Eliza.  It's almost funny, but I keep proving this axiom as I write: the mind sees what it expects to see.  I obviously read that paragraph multiple times . . .",t3_ribkqk
hp3899m,t1_hp0mj3f,Unfortunately . . . no.  I'd tried once before to do a themed series and the mods shut me down.  Not allowed on this subreddit.,t3_ribkqk
