hkkb6pj,t3_qtkne1,"I have so many questions about this one:

-Why are no masks allowed at the store? Especially if the cashier is wearing one?

-How did the doll get into the cashier’s mailbox?

-How did the guy even know where the cashier lived?",t3_qtkne1
hkkawwf,t3_qtkne1,Is this some kind of joke?,t3_qtkne1
hkkbjz4,t1_hkkb6pj,"And thank you for asking your questions and I’ll address them one at a time.

1) The creepy guy was wearing a painted Halloween mask and the cashier was wearing a medical mask. 

2) Most likely he just lifted up the mail slot of the cashiers front door and forcefully jammed it in there.

3) I was going to explore that if I wrote a new paragraph or a new chapter but right off the top of my head he probably followed him home one day.",t3_qtkne1
