hm4hytr,t3_r2f4ip,"Just wow.... This story really got to me.  The ending took me a minute to figure out what ""them"" you were referring to.  Great story,  though.",t3_r2f4ip
hm4cv0r,t3_r2f4ip,"Hey guys, this is the first story I've ever written so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to point out anything from grammatical errors (since English is not my mother tongue) to how I could improve my storytelling skills. Thank you.",t3_r2f4ip
hm50y2p,t3_r2f4ip,"Oh my. 
I swear the last sentence is one of the greatest ones I've heard in a long time. 
Amazing!!",t3_r2f4ip
hm5uvr7,t3_r2f4ip,"There’s two interpretations of hope in the box as well- since Pandora closes the box and keeps hope inside, it either means that she is saving hope or that she is preventing it from escaping out into the world.",t3_r2f4ip
hm5zpdr,t3_r2f4ip,"WOW. Just wow! 

Your story is great as-is, but I will share my thoughts/considerations. This is a story that I liked so much that I wanted more. You could build up the story and characters more to *really* draw in the reader which would make them more invested in the characters. Maybe explore the mother's pain a bit more (maybe not, it might signal where the story is going),  or sprinkle in some optimism from the girl (maybe that her father will come back or just general optimism). The ending of this story pulled the rug out from under me,  some additional development might make my heart sink through the floor. 

Or, leave it exactly the same because it was awesome!",t3_r2f4ip

hm9dvqs,t3_r2f4ip,great story! I had to buy coins to give you!,t3_r2f4ip
hm4r1hm,t3_r2f4ip,Ugh. I hate this. In a good way.,t3_r2f4ip
hm5ww0r,t3_r2f4ip,Hi OP... I need help. I don't understand the last sentence ><,t3_r2f4ip
hm8fz4k,t3_r2f4ip,Best story I’ve read in this sub. Bravo. Hits with a thoughtful dread I didn’t see coming.,t3_r2f4ip
hmfxmc5,t3_r2f4ip,Just wow. I need to re-read this one. Thanks for publishing.,t3_r2f4ip
hn14myk,t3_r2f4ip,"This story is so well put and natural, it looks like the writer has gone through a lot of this, is it?",t3_r2f4ip
hm5uqvt,t3_r2f4ip,"This is good but it reads very ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" haha",t3_r2f4ip
hm4mfix,t1_hm4hytr,"Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it.

Is there any ways I can clarify this idea better or should I leave it like that for the readers to think?",t3_r2f4ip
hm6841e,t1_hm4cv0r,What the- your *first* story? Wow.,t3_r2f4ip
hm8fuac,t1_hm4cv0r,This is an amazing story. Well done and I hope you keep sharing your stories with us.,t3_r2f4ip
hm52ul7,t1_hm50y2p,Thanks. Your reply made my day :),t3_r2f4ip
hm6ctg0,t1_hm5uvr7,"I never understood why she kept it in the box. If all the other monsters escaped, then holding hope inside wouldn't GIVE us hope. It would keep it from us, right?",t3_r2f4ip
hm75471,t1_hm5zpdr,"This is exactly what I was looking for.

I had a feeling that it lacks something but I was not sure what it is or how to fix it. You just spelled it all out for me. I will try to incorporate these tips in my next stories. Thank you so much!",t3_r2f4ip
hm4mmnj,t1_hm4malf,Definitely not her mom.,t3_r2f4ip
hm763z3,t1_hm73w4w,"You hope?

jk thank you for the encouraging words :)",t3_r2f4ip
hmcb0lt,t1_hm9dvqs,"That's great to hear. Thanks for the award, kind stranger.",t3_r2f4ip
hm63j9o,t1_hm5ww0r,"Had the mother simply resigned herself to her husband never coming back, she would have lived. As it is, her hope that he might do kept the wound raw, too raw to survive.

Hope was in the box of all evils, she decided, because it was an evil itself.",t3_r2f4ip
hm5xs7o,t1_hm4mfix,Don't clarify.  It's well done.,t3_r2f4ip
hm4msn1,t1_hm4mfix,"The choice is yours.  If you want them to puzzle it out for themselves, leave it be.  If you want to spell it out for them,  change the last line to something like ""because it too is evil and suffering"". Just a thought.",t3_r2f4ip
hm62i2w,t1_hm4mfix,Spell it out for me please,t3_r2f4ip
hm6c4xw,t1_hm6841e,ikr this is so good,t3_r2f4ip
hm78xov,t1_hm52ul7,"So happy to hear that, it's really the truth, I was blown away :)",t3_r2f4ip
hmdct7j,t1_hm4mmnj,Love that!,t3_r2f4ip
hmdp1uv,t1_hmcb0lt,"Hope to see more stories from you. Seriously, I didn't know that one day I would spend real money on Reddit 😂",t3_r2f4ip
hm74q2r,t1_hm63j9o,"I love your last sentence. This is exactly my idea for the story.

Hope, to many people, only bring pains and griefs. It is the thing that keeps us endure the worst time of our lives with the promise that things ""could"" get better. It is nothing but another devil from that corrupted chest :)",t3_r2f4ip
hmt2835,t1_hm63j9o,Thank you for the kind explanation. Brilliant execution OP ❤,t3_r2f4ip
hm69iw0,t1_hm5xs7o,"Agreed.  I like to come away from a story with that uneasy feeling that I'm missing something. 

I enjoy puzzles. I think spelling it out loses the *wow* factor of that last sentence.",t3_r2f4ip
hm6gnmn,t1_hm62i2w,Hope is evil,t3_r2f4ip
