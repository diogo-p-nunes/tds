ho96tic,t3_rept1p,"I liked it.  I especially like your dark humour - they hollered and wailed, but they were also practical so then they killed and ate them and were impressed at the flavour.  That gave me a chuckle.  Good story.",t3_rept1p
ho94nv8,t3_rept1p,"Okay this story is SO gnarly. I fucking love it!!!! I also love Animal Crossing so this was very interesting to me to read your explanation comment. Excellent story, 10/10",t3_rept1p

**Inspired by: Animal Crossing**

When I first got Animal Crossing for my Nintendo Switch--my very first game on my Switch-- I thought it was the most boring game ever. There was no plot, and you do the same things every day. But I gradually fell in love with the game. It's relaxing, and being on my island makes me think about walking in windy parks and sandy beaches with my family.

**How It Inspired The Story**

I've always found it weird that you are the only human in a town/island full of animals. Tom Nook and the other characters are very accepting of the fact, but what if they're not because you're an outcast--or even worse, very hostile? Then I saw a fan theory a few years ago that the animals in Animal Crossing are once humans, but after working on cursed land they were placed under a curse so they are animals forever.
