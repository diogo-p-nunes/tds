hlu7dhi,t1_hlskj0m,There's no need to be rude,t3_r0im8r
hlsl19p,t1_hlskj0m,"Trying to grasp what these soldier must have seen and endured truly terrifies me :D

But everyone is different I think",t3_r0im8r
hm9qxx7,t1_hm9of4n,Oh ok,t3_r0im8r
hludpvq,t1_hlu7dhi,"If someone.posts it, they need to be prepared for comments,.good or bad. The story is terrible.",t3_r0im8r
hluf5c6,t1_hludpvq,"Do be constructive, not rude",t3_r0im8r
hlvu422,t1_hludpvq,"It's absolutely fine, that you find it terrible and tell me that! I am actually glad you did!

The ""problem"" is the method of delivery, not the content. Responding to a stranger with sarcasm is just not polite and discourages people from interacting with you or the community. Because why should someone engage, if the community is just not a polite place to navigate and feels toxic?

Commenting ""IMHO I think it's terrible and I don't like it"" would be totally fine and delivers your message and opinion.

And of course is my first story terrible and it's fine to point this out. Would be great if you had provided some constructive criticism, but you don't have to.

But you actively choose to be rude, why? Telling me it's terrible is not rude, but how you did it is.

You do you, but always think about how you would feel, if someone reacted this way. Do you want people to treat you like this?  
And again it's not about you finding the story terrible, that's fine :D

This is not about me, this is about having a great place sharing stories and discussing it in a constructive and fair atmosphere. This also mean criticizing stories and telling the author, that it's not good. Nobody can improve their self, when no one points out the bad stuff. But in a polite and constructive manner!",t3_r0im8r
hlz7yiz,t1_hlvu422,"Again, be prepared for anything if you post in public.

I don't care about your feelings nor am I interested in your response. It's a crappy story, revisit your technique.",t3_r0im8r
hm0einn,t1_hlz7yiz,"I am, I've navigated the internet long enough.
This has never been about my feelings nor about myself.
Just reflect and think a bit about it, this behavior won't bring you far in life.

I have a saying, someone who is happy in life doesn't mistreat others.",t3_r0im8r
