hnoffpj,t1_hno7wj5,"Crows are extremely intelligent and learn quickly. If fed regularly by someone they will return, often bringing more, and learn to trade little things they find for food. This story is sort of plausible. I doubt they would understand to take the toe to the cops, but it’s nice to imagine.",t3_rb35tx

hnpijsn,t1_hnoffpj,"I think these smart urban crows would be quite aware of what cops are and where to find them :) :) Cops are so distinctive after all. 

But I was debating, as I was writing, whether they should take the toe just to anybody outside the house, or specifically cops. I chose the latter for a neater ending (which was still confusing for some <sigh>  )",t3_rb35tx
