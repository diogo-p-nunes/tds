hkvkogb,t3_qtp4pg,"u/Economy_Candidate299 and u/SimbaTheSavage8, you guys are both awesome authors! 

I performed one of Simba's stories a while back, Ep 5. I love when I can see and hear it in my head the first time I read it. If I ever hit it big, I would love to make mini-movies out of everyone's stories, with actors, etc.",t3_qtp4pg

PLEASE ASK FOR MY PERMISSION TO USE MY STORIES. THIEVERY HURTS.

After a few adventures in my other other imaginary world, I returned to writing horror. For now.

Here it is.

Also, I would like to thank u/SimbaTheSavage8 for helpful feedback on this story, and for teaching me on how to use bold and italics for Reddit. You have my thanks.
