I love it!

But you've got the timeline of insemination and a positive pregnancy test wrong.
It's a minor detail, but it took my mind out of the story.

After insemination, you'll usually be able to test positive by the first day of the next cycle (the day the next period would start).
Day 6 after insemination is when the egg would implant in the uterus lining, so the level of HCG is WAY too low to give a positive test.
You CAN test by day 8, 9 or 10, BUT you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment, since the hormones you take for the insemination is the same as the hormones you test for in a pregnancy test, so you'll likely get a false positive.
And usually you'll get a early scan of the baby by week 6-8, since insemination means there is a bigger risk of ectopic pregnancy.

Anyway - great creepy story, but they would never make it 28 weeks without knowing.",t3_rgwg2y

honi5fm,t1_honcw3y,Sorry. Typo. Fixed.,t3_rgwg2y
hoqp8ip,t1_hop9qbo,"here's the thing - it's not a baby. maybe a parasite?

and it wasn't a doctor who inseminated, either.

so yeah, it's wrong, but the woman was misinformed by ""Atlas"". so i guess it still fits in with the story?",t3_rgwg2y
honou90,t1_hon7z20,"As a different take from the other response, I read it as it being something other than a baby like some kind of parasite.",t3_rgwg2y

honivy1,t1_honi5fm,Same typo in the last line and the third to last line.,t3_rgwg2y
hooopwr,t1_honou90,I think so too.  An alien or something!,t3_rgwg2y
hondlsd,t1_honcue5,I understood the typical hysterical pregnancy. What I don't get is what's supposed to be scary about it.,t3_rgwg2y
hone0ks,t1_hondlsd,"Probably the fact that the ""mama"" still felt the baby kicking. Plus, the whole situation in itself: being scammed by a fake  ""doctor"", growing a baby bump even though you're not pregnant...",t3_rgwg2y
hoqdspb,t1_hondlsd,"I’d think the idea of planning for your baby, the room, the supplies, etc, and waking up one day to just find that it’s all fake is TERRIFYING.",t3_rgwg2y
