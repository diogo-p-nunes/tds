hnpe4nc,t3_rbosg6,"*This is part of the Video Game Collection, an anthology of stories based on video games that I love. Inspired by u/hyperobscura’s album of the year collection!*

**Inspired by: Pokémon Mystery Dungeon franchise**

You can’t spell a list of my favourite video games without PMD. I fell in love with Red Rescue Team, the first one in the series, and all the one after that, and for good reason too. PMD has everything I want in a video game: an emotional story that makes you feel like you’re cutting onions, cute, well-rounded characters, and best of all, a jaw-dropping, amazing soundtrack. Seriously. I have favourites from every game, from Rescue all the way to Super, and I used to love cuddling up in the car, listening to music with my 3DS in my hand.

In other words, PMD is awesome. Highly recommended if you have a Switch or DS.

As for how PMD inspired this story, there’s a lot of realistic elements that make PMD, PMD. For one, (minor spoilers if you don’t know what PMD is about) >!the player always wakes up in the beginning with no memory of his time in the human world!< ,and that is terrifying enough on its own. Then PMD is a dungeon-crawler, meaning mazes, and in mazes you can get easily lost, especially with the pressure of somebody behind you. There’s a lot of things that can happen when you’re alone, especially when you don’t know where you’re going.

hnt48eq,t1_hns9342,"i don't know which one to start with though. obviously the gba ones but they're probably pretty expensive, maybe i could cop a ds one, i don't know yet",t3_rbosg6
hnt6gna,t1_hnt48eq,"Blue Rescue Team is similar to Red Rescue Team, and is on the DS.👍

But to start, I recommend Explorers of Sky. It’s the second in the series and is the best-rated, the story is the best, and there’s a lot of content for you to explore.
