hlrppx1,t3_r0e6c6,"Okay. Full disclosure, I wrote an AITA here a while back. But I am happy to poke fun at myself in a story. This topic just seemed ripe for satire. Happy Tuesday!",t3_r0e6c6
hluuw8t,t3_r0e6c6,I am so embarrassed that I’m struggling yo understand the last bit here. What is the horror? I enjoyed the writing though!,t3_r0e6c6
hlv6dax,t3_r0e6c6,Haha. Love that title. Story was gold too.,t3_r0e6c6
hlru3pb,t1_hlrppx1,This is fucking brilliant. 🔥,t3_r0e6c6
hlrzzwj,t1_hlrppx1,So did this really happen?,t3_r0e6c6
hlv2730,t1_hluuw8t,"Oh, you’re good 😊. There are two stories here. 

The under story about this sub is cautionary “horror” about delving too deep into gimmick tropes like the AITA fake out story. The surface story is about losing everyone you know, all of them being transformed into the same lifeless thing, even in your memories. 

(I’m not anti-gimmick or trope as long as they have a spin that makes them fun, but there’s lots lately. Taking a break reinforces the impact 🤷)",t3_r0e6c6
hls1xee,t1_hlrzzwj,"Of course. All my stories are true. And I did consult a Ouija Board about my standing with the dead of my tales. When I asked if I was the asshole, the planchette went to YES like sooo quickly. Now it’s fused to the board. $19.99 down the drain. SMH",t3_r0e6c6
hls29e2,t1_hls1xee,I can relate. I think the dead of my stories hate me too. Especially since a lot of people die in them.,t3_r0e6c6
