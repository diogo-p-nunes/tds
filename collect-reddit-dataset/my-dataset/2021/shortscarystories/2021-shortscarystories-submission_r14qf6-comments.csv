hlwvuln,t3_r14qf6,Does this mean that Sarah is dead already and so can’t hurt/kill you when you look into her eyes? And replace her with what? Another dead person with green eyes?,t3_r14qf6
hlyv2x2,t3_r14qf6,"fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
I did not see that coming.",t3_r14qf6
hlweqvk,t3_r14qf6,Sounds like you need to go to the doctors,t3_r14qf6
hm05xrg,t3_r14qf6,I though I was on r/introvert before the hol up,t3_r14qf6
hm12ww1,t3_r14qf6,"What's up with you? You are probably a creature, not a basket case. 

I named mine Sarah, too.",t3_r14qf6
hm2icop,t3_r14qf6,"Me a person who never looks people in the eye, hahaha",t3_r14qf6
hlww5r5,t1_hlwvuln,Correct! Sarah needs to be replaced with another Sarah to keep the relationship going. The eyes color doesn't matter as long as they are not deadly.,t3_r14qf6
hm59yej,t1_hm2icop,Same. It’s common for people with Asperger’s to avoid eye contact. My other half has long since learned that just because I’m not looking at her doesn’t mean I’m not listening to her.,t3_r14qf6
hlwx5xb,t1_hlww5r5,Good to know!,t3_r14qf6
hly2s0k,t1_hlwx5xb,Alternatively you could probably get someone to taxidermy the body so it stops decomposing (:,t3_r14qf6
hly40jw,t1_hly2s0k,"Good advice, but it's kinda hard to ask someone to taxidermize a corpse without getting arrested :(",t3_r14qf6
hlyokmf,t1_hly40jw,You can learn how to DIY taxidermy.,t3_r14qf6
hm0bbzy,t1_hly40jw,"How about a life-like mannequin? Might be expensive but you dont have to replace since it wont decompose?

Also are you stealing corpses or making them as corpses?",t3_r14qf6
hm0dd3w,t1_hm0bbzy,"A traumatized person myself, I always try to help others in trouble. 

I usually help women to escape from their abusive families and relationships, and allow them to happily live with me for eternity.",t3_r14qf6
