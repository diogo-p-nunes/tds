hoo136z,t3_rh4299,"You read correctly. This one has a happy ending. A first for me.

If, like the Grinch, you prefer unhappy endings then head over to r/scarabium where there is plenty of depressing content to gorge on.

Plus I've written some longer, traditional Ghost Stories for Christmas for everyone to enjoy.

All the best!",t3_rh4299
