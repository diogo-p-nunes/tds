hm0na6m,t3_r07j5p,I think this would be more shocking if the title didn't explain it beforehand. Great story.,t3_r07j5p
hmdwh6z,t3_r07j5p,"I just can't understand any situation where you don't immediately know you've grabbed the wrong thing. There typically a different length, different shape, and even then it would be instantly noticeable trying to jam a razor in your mouth. I like the shock factor of the store but it seems too silly to take seriously.",t3_r07j5p

hmi35c4,t1_hmhi3gd,That just makes me think there is something wrong with you lol. Not that it is something that can easily happen. How anyone could even manage I have no idea. Sounds like a miserable mistake to somehow make.,t3_r07j5p

hmn13aa,t1_hmmz4kb,Buy a [night light]( https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01LQX0BXA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apan_glt_i_P2F51HTSVHVHQWTYRP3S). You can't just assume the reader is too dumb to question the situation. Take the constructive criticism and continue to get better. Don't insult people.,t3_r07j5p
hmopnx0,t1_hmn13aa,[deleted],t3_r07j5p
hmphkvl,t1_hmopnx0,Take your own words of wisdom to heart here and move on. You're making mountains out of molehills now. This conversation has lasted longer than your story. I've already told you that the believability is too far of a stretch making the story seem a bit silly to me. You couldn't handle that criticism and got defensive. Relax and move on. Sorry not being simply praised has shook you so much.,t3_r07j5p
