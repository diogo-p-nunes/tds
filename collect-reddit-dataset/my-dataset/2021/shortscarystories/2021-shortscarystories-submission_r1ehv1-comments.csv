hm9gvia,t1_hlz2wqe,"I gotta know....is this a shot against embracing diversity? Cause gotta be honest, that's why this stood out so much. If I read it wrong or took the wrong message away I deeply apologize.",t3_r1ehv1
hm9i0jf,t1_hm9gvia,"No need to apologize. “Death of the Author”-once a piece is out, it’s out, it doesn’t matter what the intentions of the author are.

But for what it’s worth, no, I am not against diversity! This piece is a satire about what ppl like Brian think diversity does, and how workplaces approach diversity.",t3_r1ehv1
hm9s2jl,t1_hm9i0jf,"I agree with u/MyOCDisMildAtBest the story sounds like your against Diversity, and if you have to explain that your not, then the story doesn't work.",t3_r1ehv1
