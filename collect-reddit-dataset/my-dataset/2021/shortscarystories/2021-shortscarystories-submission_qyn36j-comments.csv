hlij3lf,t3_qyn36j,"Glad you're both okay. I'm sure I'm not the only one wondering this: Were any others injured? Was the driver cited or ticketed?

I hate to say this, but getting rear-ended while stopped in traffic is a lawyer's wet-dream. My sister in law collected nearly $250K when it happened to her. Her physical injuries were minor, but the trauma and shock left her unwilling to drive for about a year. 

Hope you both get proper and fair compensation. 

I'm not a lawyer, but sometimes I wish I were!",t3_qyn36j
hlh3lly,t3_qyn36j,"I am thankful that you are okay, Mr. Gravy. Please send my well-wishes to your wife.",t3_qyn36j
hliyakh,t3_qyn36j,"Glad everyone is good, HG! Iâ€™ve seen cars hit by trains that look as bad. Sheesh. Of course, Iâ€™d write your car crash with you getting pursued by some eldritch insurance adjuster afterward and you and Mrs. Gravy descending into madness. Iâ€™m glad your true story is more wholesome! ðŸ«€",t3_qyn36j
hli49kx,t3_qyn36j,"I'm very glad and so thankful you and Mrs. Gravy are still here, and I'm looking forward to reading some terrible turkey tales!",t3_qyn36j
hlp6ebr,t3_qyn36j,Glad you're both ok stay safe my lovelies x,t3_qyn36j
hm3o7mk,t3_qyn36j,"Fucking hell man, glad yâ€™all are okay! Iâ€™ve had the same thing happen, itâ€™s really scary.",t3_qyn36j
hlrsrnl,t3_qyn36j,"Glad you're safe, Grav.",t3_qyn36j
hlju68m,t1_hlij3lf,"I believe the other driver was ticketed. She ended up being pinned upside in her car for a while. It was actually pretty scary to see that. She ended up being okay though. We will be seeing what we can do with regards to insurance and suing if necessary.

My wife is deathly afraid of flying but we took a plane home because now sheâ€™s terrified to drive.",t3_qyn36j
hljtn97,t1_hlh3lly,Thanks!,t3_qyn36j
hlk5wu6,t1_hliyakh,"Haha, you better believe Iâ€™ve gotten some story ideas from this whole debacle. Itâ€™s definitely something to think about.",t3_qyn36j
hlk5ztr,t1_hli49kx,Thanks! Me too. Wanna get back to fictional horror rather than real life misery.,t3_qyn36j
hm5ziu8,t1_hlp6ebr,Thanks!,t3_qyn36j
hm5zh0i,t1_hm3o7mk,It certainly is!,t3_qyn36j
hlk8al7,t1_hlju68m,"Wow. Sorry you had to go through that. I'm assuming you don't have kids, or if so, they weren't in the car. Because I cannot imagine anyone in the back seat would have survived. You really are very fortunate.",t3_qyn36j
hlk6kyp,t1_hlk5wu6,"Good. When the Fates fail to clip your mortal thread, grab a frayed strand and spin a yarn. ðŸ˜™",t3_qyn36j
hlo8ge9,t1_hlk5wu6,"I wish you and Mrs Gravy have a full recovery. I am glad you are still with us!
I hope you didn't have to seal any dark deal ðŸ¤«",t3_qyn36j
hlldn4p,t1_hlk8al7,"Nope, no kids here. Thereâ€™s a picture of the backseat showing how it basically caved in on the driver side. If anyone was in the backseat, Iâ€™m 99% sure they would have died. We had a buddy meeting us down there who could have easily agreed to driven with us. Either myself or him would have sat in the back so itâ€™s real lucky he decided to fly.",t3_qyn36j
hlovo1k,t1_hlldn4p,"Wow. Totally dodged a bullet, so to speak.",t3_qyn36j
