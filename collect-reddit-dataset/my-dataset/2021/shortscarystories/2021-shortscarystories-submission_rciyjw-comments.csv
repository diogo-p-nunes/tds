hnuyi1g,t3_rciyjw,"Well, well...and I just happen to be reading a sci-fi book right now.

If this story doesn't have you giving a terror-filled glance at the sky, then something is wrong with your survival instincts!!
This is my secret fear; that something incomprehensible will come and enslave us all..

Thank you, for giving my brain more nightmare fodder...I can always count on your help!!

(Beautifully crafted story, my dear friend...love it!!!)",t3_rciyjw

**HYPER’S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#7:** Dvne - Etemen Ænka

**Genre:** Progressive Sludge/Stoner Metal

About one minute into my first listen-through of this album, I made myself a promise; if this holds up all the way through, it’s going right on my top 10.

And lo and behold; here we are.

In my humble opinion, Dvne out-Mastodons Mastodon on this epic conceptual journey across time and space. It is heavy, melodic, expertly paced, and incredibly nuanced. From the invigorating intro of Enûma Eliš to the mesmerizing, almost threatening outro of Satuya, I never once felt bored, which, given the albums length of one hour and seven minutes, is really something.

As for how the album inspired the story, I wanted to stick to the Sci-Fi feel, but not to such an extent that I felt like I borrowed too much from the album itself. The result is sort of an ancient technology / invasion-hybrid, with some pretty grim “dark humanity” elements scattered throughout.

**Favorite Track:** If you want a single song to reel you in, I find that Omega Severer does a great job of representing many of the musical elements you’ll find in the album.

**Album Rating:** Sì-XIV",t3_rciyjw

This line really stole the entire cake for me. Beautiful visuals!",t3_rciyjw

hnvfw6o,t3_rciyjw,Love this! Great work as always Hyper :),t3_rciyjw
hnyaipq,t3_rciyjw,"Still amazed that you can manage to terrify me on a consistent basis with story that only take me a few mins to read. That is true talent, much easier to have an entire book to scare folks than somehow fitting the amount of unease and terror into a hand ful of paragraphs. You have a life long fan here. Was also pretty pumped to hear one of your stories on the No Sleep Podcast, not gonna lie I may have produced a fan girl squeal that would put a pre teen girl to shame when David said your name.",t3_rciyjw

hnz1fd7,t3_rciyjw,"Yes oh yes this I enjoyed! Bravo my friend, I shall ponder upon this for a while.  I’ve been on an old sci-fi horror movie kick the last couple of days (no clue why started rewatching the Alien vs Predator offerings and carried on from there to the Arrival; no clue where it will end) and this fits into that kick quite nicely",t3_rciyjw
