I want to stress that this is only a story. Please do not take the actions of Basil. If you are being bullied there is help out there for you. As a kid I was bullied. I think at some point in time we all have been. But, time will heal. Life gets better. Put yourself first and be the best you you can be. Make life *your* bitch. Not the other way around. 

Love to you all.

hljceix,t1_hlhytw6,"Awesome message my friend. Amazing story and I felt very connected to the characters in this one. I agree, bullies aren't worth losing or forcing your way out of living. I had mine for a long time. I finally found the strength to start fighting back. And boy did I fight. Physically sometimes. But most of the time it was an emotional and mental fight. 

Anyone being bullied who is reading this right now...stay strong. You will overcome. There is always a safe way to gain confidence back and live happy. I know. I experienced it. I saw others go through it. You are not alone.

Thank you OP for the awesome story and the message at the end. There's never too many times for someone to be reminded that everything will be all good.âœŒ",t3_qyt3hu
