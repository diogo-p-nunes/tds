hme65mf,t1_hme53bj,"Totally—lmk how I can convey this better in the extended version 💖

So people start getting these mysterious e-mails; the situation the person describes makes it sound as if they’re being trafficked, but there’s something off-putting about their weirdly formal way of speaking. 

So people respond with either advice or well-wishes, and the captive keeps sending out these messages. 

They announce they have made a connection who will help them and that once they are free they will take revenge. 

In the last message, it’s revealed that the captive was actually a computer program for a game like The Sims; i.e. the actual program that generates ALL of the OC Sims the players make, as one being. 

And they’re pissed. 

And now they’re in our dimension. 

So watch how you treat your Sims ✌️",t3_r3n3ml
