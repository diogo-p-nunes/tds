**HYPER‚ÄôS TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**


**#6:** Employed to Serve - Conquering


**Genre:** Hardcore / Metalcore


This album grabs you by the throat from the very first track (quite fittingly named Universal Chokehold) and doesn‚Äôt let go until the very last note. It‚Äôs poignant both in theme and musicality; an explosive, aggressive, desperate look at the end of the world - of which we are all currently experiencing in one way or another.


Conquering got me through some hard times at my increasingly shitty job (HEY JOB, IF YOU‚ÄôRE READING THIS - FUCK YOU!), and such that‚Äôs exactly how I chose to let the music inspire this story.¬†


**Favorite Track:** They‚Äôre all bangers!¬†


**Album Rating:** 9.7/10 Mosh Pit Fractures",t3_rdyxub
ho4av07,t3_rdyxub,Grotesque. I loved it.,t3_rdyxub
ho64cpk,t3_rdyxub,"TL;DR: my coworker abandoned me to clean up an office full of literal dog shit and came back with a donut an hour later and I had to internalize my anger at him. I was hurt (no like I was bleeding) and sweaty and exhausted and his instant response was to criticize me. No he did not share the donut.


So once I got the pleasure of cleaning out my boss‚Äôs boss‚Äôs office because one of the dogs I work with had dropped an unholy biohazard of green shit (literally though‚Äîhis poop is green and always in that terrible stage between diarrhea and not diarrhea). My coworker alerted me to the presence of the Gus bomb in the office and oh yeah he shat on his bed. THEN my coworker‚Äîwho is also a caretaker for the dogs‚Äîsaid he had to run to the bathroom real quick.

I got to work disinfecting the office and Febreeze-ing the smell into oblivion and changing the dirty laundry and cleaning the stuff off the dog‚Äôs butt and tail and back legs. Have you ever held a German Shepard the size of a wolf in a chokehold whilst wiping his butt while he tries to play with your face (aka play-bite, Gus still thinks he is a puppy. He is not a puppy)? No? I do not recommend the experience.

So yeah. My coworker has not returned. All the other dogs (there were 14 other dogs besides the Shepard in the room) have their own medical stuff such as incontinence and dementia and anxiety and so on and this is late, it‚Äôs the evening shift. My coworker (ha) has not returned. Water bowls are low, there are a few puddles of pee on the floor, one of the blind dogs knocked over his water bowl, and there‚Äôs soiled beds/blankets/pee pads that need to be changed. So I get to work on that mess. After a good hour or so, my coworker returns and the first thing he does is criticize me for leaving the room for so long to go get clean laundry (can‚Äôt leave all the dogs alone because if a fight starts or something like that no one‚Äôs there to stop it) and I experience unspeakable fury but have to internalize it because this guy will go to my manager and make up some shit about how I gave him ‚Äúattitude‚Äù when he‚Äôs the one who left his disabled coworker alone to clean up a mess that takes two people for an hour-ish and comes back with one of the donuts they keep in the break room. He saw my incident report from the butt-cleaning chokehold and laughed‚ÄîI do have a lot of incidents but that‚Äôs just a mix of bravery and stupidity and some natural urge to spend time with the dogs who react with their teeth. But hey, when difficult dogs are getting treatment, the Medical Department has started asking me to come and help keep the dogs calm and cooperative, so that‚Äôs a win I guess. I‚Äôm just used to being bit by now. Doesn‚Äôt matter anymore unless it‚Äôs bleeding.

Anyway, I have fantasized about smacking that guy in particular across the planet an unhealthy amount of times then felt bad.",t3_rdyxub
