hl20he2,t3_qw4aw3,Loved it.     A refreshing change .,t3_qw4aw3
hl2f7w5,t3_qw4aw3,"Ah this is fucking great! I love the poem, and the rhyming wasn‚Äôt cheesy at all, it was well chosen. Awesome!",t3_qw4aw3
hl3apo5,t3_qw4aw3,Great work!!! The form of a poem further accentuates the dark setting imo,t3_qw4aw3
hl3odvy,t3_qw4aw3,Great stuff,t3_qw4aw3
hl4itk1,t3_qw4aw3,"This. Is. BEAUTIFUL! AND HEAVILY UNDERRATED. UGHH, I JUST GAVE AWAY MY FREE AWARDD",t3_qw4aw3
hl4bhnb,t3_qw4aw3,Lovely poem. I'd 100% like to see more,t3_qw4aw3
hl4iqkh,t3_qw4aw3,I adore this! I want to use it in my game this weekend!,t3_qw4aw3
hl4pcpu,t3_qw4aw3,"I loved this!! I wish I was better at making comics because this would flow so well with drawings/art, I think",t3_qw4aw3
hl8h0os,t3_qw4aw3,Stunning work!,t3_qw4aw3
hl0hfgw,t1_hl0ewv6,"Are they taboo here? I usually don't go for poetry so much, but hot diggity dog, this was smoking hot stuff! And the ending... You reign supreme.",t3_qw4aw3
hl366c0,t1_hl0ewv6,"I don't know if it's important enough to you to edit your post, but you can force a single newline (carriage return) on Reddit by typing two spaces at the end of the line, before pressing enter.

It seems that the rule used to be two or more, but because of reasons it now requires exactly two.",t3_qw4aw3
hl13p1w,t1_hl12x4b,"A town sacrifices a child once per year in autumn. The narrators child is the last one left. He prays and a voice warns him that it might be a trick‚Äîthe Pastor is eating the child sacrifices. Narrator kills the Pastor. It wasn‚Äôt him. It was the son. The last couplet implies that silence (some otherworldly, possibly demonic force) has won.",t3_qw4aw3
hl1tna4,t1_hl1pxbg,Thanks! Glad to breed a brain worm.,t3_qw4aw3
hl1wy1o,t1_hl1v839,Thanks lady!,t3_qw4aw3
hl2y9o8,t1_hl2l7xs,And so it begins üòÅ,t3_qw4aw3
hl2q8tz,t1_hl2q5ee,effing beautiful,t3_qw4aw3
hl2ym4u,t1_hl2xykn,"I had that instinct too!  Unfortunately the meter doesn‚Äôt vary, so the bars get repetitive kinda quickly. ü§∑",t3_qw4aw3

hl6i23j,t1_hl4itk1,I just appreciate the read!,t3_qw4aw3
hl5ddjj,t1_hl4iqkh,5e? 3.5?,t3_qw4aw3
hl0hysz,t1_hl0hfgw,"Maybe not taboo. They tend to be poorly received, which I get. It‚Äôs a sub for stories and a rhyme scheme pulls you out of the narrative. But! I love it. And thanks gran! üòä",t3_qw4aw3
hl36lhi,t1_hl366c0,"Looking weird on a browser? I never know these things (I always post on the iOS app)

Edit: looks fine in Chrome",t3_qw4aw3
hl13vwn,t1_hl13p1w,Ah I see. Well yea I completely missed it but ai enjoyed reading it lmao. I liked the rhythm(? Is that what you call it?) And would love more,t3_qw4aw3
hl1vgqe,t1_hl13p1w,"""The silence ticks around my son,

His fear a trick, for he has won""

Gah, now you have me thinking in rhyme! Well done",t3_qw4aw3
hl8n46s,t1_hl13p1w,"Is it implied that the voice the narrator heard belonged to his son (since, when the son speaks for the second time, for the narrator he has ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs own voice inside‚Äô)? And what is the ‚ÄòHoly Ghost‚Äô:

>	You slay on Sunday, sup the host // On daughters, sons, and Holy Ghost.",t3_qw4aw3
hl1xgbh,t1_hl1wy1o,"And I agree. Prose tends to do better than poetry, and is easier to do. But poems are still fun. Plus my friend helps with mine too.",t3_qw4aw3

hl5pol4,t1_hl5ddjj,"Exalted 3E. I also run a heist game in DnD 5E. 

Edit: Exalted 3E, DnD 5 E, it's our VtM game that's the other 5E. We game a lot in my house.",t3_qw4aw3
hl0jbpa,t1_hl0hysz,"No offence meant to anyone, but I'd rather read something like this than yet another story masquerading as a tale from another subreddit.

It's so much better when people try and do something different.",t3_qw4aw3
hl0nezc,t1_hl0hysz,"But a good narrative can also rhyme, as you just proved. Clever gentleman! ‚ù§",t3_qw4aw3
hl1zkml,t1_hl0hysz,"Hmmm, poems are hard to do well imo, maybe thats part of the reason why many are poorly received. From my memory (which may be biased) many of the ones I read here really didn't seem that great to me.

I have to compliment you on this poem here though, I really love the rythm and pacing!",t3_qw4aw3
hl4v8w2,t1_hl0hysz,"Well, I, for one, was inspired! I decided to [write my own poem](https://reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/qwt1i6/a_tale_from_a_ruined_town/), though it was too long to post on ShortScaryStories by just a little bit. Thank you for the great story, and for the inspiration! Keep it up!",t3_qw4aw3
hl3bdnm,t1_hl36lhi,It looks fine on Boost but not on the actual Reddit android app. There's no carriage return between each line.,t3_qw4aw3

hl1wu95,t1_hl1vgqe,Now give it a melody and your life‚Äôs a musical,t3_qw4aw3
hl8zyrv,t1_hl8n46s,"First question, yes. When narrator prayed and heard from ‚ÄúGod‚Äù it was his son manipulating him. 

Second question, it‚Äôs pastor prentice (the spirit of a holy man) but also a reference to the holy trinity, substituting daughter for father. 

In the end, the town has sacrificed all its children and its spiritual leader, complete some sort of ritual for the benefit of whatever is inhabiting the son.",t3_qw4aw3
hl36y7g,t1_hl2zbzi,Thanks! üòä,t3_qw4aw3
hl5rbg9,t1_hl5pol4,"Nice! Sometimes DM myself. I had tried to propose horror elements for another user a while back. Some of my faves:

* A group of children playing jacks with phylacteries. 
* A bag of holding on the ground with thousands of ants crawling in and out. 
* A man with a sack facing a corner whispering ‚Äúit has to be replaced‚Äù over and over in thieves cant. Disturbing him in any way causes him to fall over. He‚Äôs dead, gaping hole in his chest. His sack is full of hearts. 
* An adult dragon with its head smashed in and no other apparent injuries. The only thing around is a small wooden mallet and tiny bloody footprints leading away.",t3_qw4aw3
hl0phvj,t1_hl0jbpa,"Yeah. But the fake outs play. And it feels good to get golds and go over 1k. I get it. So long as the readers keep showing love, the sub switch stories will stay. Adulation is a drug. I got plenty for dozens of family abuse stories and I kept writing and loving it.",t3_qw4aw3
hl270eb,t1_hl1zkml,This one might be a departure for me in that it has a plot. It‚Äôs a story not a poetic treatment of a horror concept. IDK,t3_qw4aw3
hl5emi1,t1_hl4v8w2,Very nice! Got kind of a horror western vibe.,t3_qw4aw3
hl3bnp9,t1_hl3bdnm,"Ah, it's just the official Android app? I didn't realise.",t3_qw4aw3

hl5sxjg,t1_hl5rbg9,"Those sound fucking awesome! You're steering my game down a different alley...

My Exalted game went far away from your usual setting in Creation, and, as The Wild Hunt was about to kill them all before they exalted, they were snatched away, along with a giant, city-sized snake that had just erupted from a sealed place. They woke up on a space ship called Ark 27, a conservation ship transporting a bunch of unique creatures to their new home on a different planet. The humans who were caught up in snagging the snake were kept alive to be food for the last leg of the trip.

The planet was already overpopulated with humans so the ship destroyed 99% of them and turned the creatures loose to remake the world how they need it. The ship released viruses, spores, etc. This enables the world to have whatever I need to tell an interesting story. One city was hit with spores that was the corpsys breed, that took over the bodies of people, causing them the climb to the top of the city buildings and spread the spores. That was very horrifying to them to discover.

You have some seriously fantastic ideas! I would love to use them, if you would allow it. Not making any money or putting them on YouTube or anything. Just private use, but I would still prefer to ask permission.",t3_qw4aw3
hl0ukb3,t1_hl0phvj,"I know what you mean but chasing those big upvotes is a one-way trip to frustration road. A thousand votes one day, seven the next.

Opening my own subreddit was the best thing. I like putting things on there for everyone to enjoy (if that's the right word!) Four votes, four-hundred votes, I'm not that fussed as I had a good time writing them. It's my own crazy little world.

I skip all the sub switch and AITA stories now. I'd rather read something like this.",t3_qw4aw3
hl6zgxd,t1_hl270eb,"Si, I love the ballad style.",t3_qw4aw3
hl5ex4l,t1_hl5emi1,That‚Äôs the idea!,t3_qw4aw3
hl61plq,t1_hl5sxjg,Do it! I‚Äôm always for good homebrew shenanigans. Like monsters that give 1d4 exhaustion that you can get back with hit dice or a force that takes an attunement slot or hit dice as currency in a town where vitality is a commodity. Prime fuckery,t3_qw4aw3
hl64ti1,t1_hl5sxjg,"Ooh, or (and this basically an arc, but) There‚Äôs a company that handles most of the quests in a region. They use the proceeds to support an orphanage. 

There‚Äôs another company that sells cheap healing potions that don‚Äôt always work. They‚Äôre moving into potions that almost act like scrolls. 

There‚Äôs a group of gnolls/goblins/w/e that are always attacking a group of towns but they have a code not to kill children. 

One person finances all three. 

Parents die, kids go to orphanage. Kids go in, healing potions come out. Bye bye kids. Some kids would have been magically gifted. Spell potions come out. Adventurers pass through. There‚Äôs a lot of quests to try and fight gnolls/goblins/w/e. There‚Äôs a company that‚Äôs selling cheap heals for a dangerous profession. 

Just thought of that. There might be holes, but evil AF for a low level operation.",t3_qw4aw3
hl0vt2j,t1_hl0ukb3,"Well thanks! I wrote a few stories under an alt a while back, sort of testing celebrity. That week DecorativeGentleman had an all day top post twice my alt had just a handful of upvotes. Four stories in total I think, written in two days. Same quality, ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù authors. Since then, I decided to slow down. A notable name crowds the feed. Same as a host of AITAs. Moderation is key.",t3_qw4aw3
hl6bcwv,t1_hl61plq,Thank you!,t3_qw4aw3
hl6bke5,t1_hl64ti1,"I think you just came up with my main villain. Love that!

I'll take notes and keep you posted on how they go.",t3_qw4aw3

hl6ebjp,t1_hl6bke5,"Throw in some ‚ÄúI grew up in a peaceful village. A boring place really that boasted little more than an inn with a watering hole for passersby and a few farmsteads. We sat out the machinations of powerful men and watched the crops grow. And then the *heroes* came. That‚Äôs what they called themselves. A fighter and a few mages. They had gold to spend and thought that bought them our admiration. Were it just the fighter we could have stood a chance with pitchforks and clubs, but the mages brought down fire and killing light. I sat by‚Äîa child‚Äîand watched my village burn. The blood of men my father had called friends did little to feed the crops. But it fed a flicker inside of me. I would protect the little places from so called heroes by giving magic to the wheelwrights and farm hands. I just needed to find out how. And then I met an Alchemist. He had been discarded by the Academy for dangerous ideas just as I had been discarded by my childhood. He taught. I listened. And now I am this close to making our dream a reality.‚Äù And boom! You‚Äôve got a dynamic villain",t3_qw4aw3
