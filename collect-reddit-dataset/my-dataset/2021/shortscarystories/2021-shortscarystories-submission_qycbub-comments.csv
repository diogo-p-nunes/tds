hlf2ge0,t3_qycbub,"Really creepy and well written. The only detail that I found over-the-top is anyone jumping four feet into the air, particularly after an exhausting day of cleaning and breathing dusty attic air. I love your work!",t3_qycbub
hlf3sio,t3_qycbub,I found the nosleep version better. Even the hyperbole felt more natural coming a bit later than in the shorter version. Details like the similarity of the dollhouse inhabitants to the characters is a bit more subtly addressed. Just a matter of personal preference.,t3_qycbub
hlfr9j8,t3_qycbub,"That was awesomely creepy! Well done. 
Love it!",t3_qycbub
hlf2qdn,t1_hlf2ge0,"Haha yeah thats a hyperbole, to make it seem cartoonish. Oh I wrote a longer version and put it on r/nosleep, couldn't quite decide. Do let me know which you think is better.",t3_qycbub
hlf4ba1,t1_hlf3sio,"Yeah the 500 word limit kills the subtlesness a lot of times. I also liked the longer version better for the flow but I love this sub ðŸ§¡

Thank you for taking time to read and provide your insight, appreciate it!",t3_qycbub
