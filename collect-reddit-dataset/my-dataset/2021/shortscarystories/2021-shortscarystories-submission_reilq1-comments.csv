ho7z8yi,t3_reilq1,Horrific and disgusting. Great story :),t3_reilq1
ho7vv43,t3_reilq1,This is horrifying and why I donâ€™t trust religion,t3_reilq1
ho7wbjo,t1_ho7vv43,"I mean, most religion is definitely not like this.",t3_reilq1
ho94log,t1_ho7vv43,Im atheist but bruh,t3_reilq1
houxg75,t1_ho7wbjo,Some are though. Therein lies the horror.,t3_reilq1
hov2m4p,t1_houxg75,"That a part of a large phenomenon can be harmful? Yeah, sure, it's not good, but it's not scary. There's no shock, no twist, no build up, no sense of inevitability, nothing that makes something scary other than the chance of harm itself.",t3_reilq1
hovh1lj,t1_hov2m4p,"Which is all well and good, except we can't decide what is and isn't horrifying for other people only ourselves.",t3_reilq1
hovh7m4,t1_hovh1lj,"All I'm saying is I don't see why you're scared of religion, and an opinion needs reasoning. I just don't know what that is.",t3_reilq1
hovu4e2,t1_hovh7m4,"It isn't so much that I'm scared of it.  And it's not religion itself but the depraved acts people commit under the guise of religion that disgust me. That's what is horrifying to me. That people can commit heinous acts and believe that some invisible being wanted them to do that to others. Nah, bro. Hard pass on that.",t3_reilq1
hovutki,t1_hovu4e2,"And anyone would agree. It's just that wording is a little important. ""I'm scared of religion"" is different than ""I'm scared of murderous lunatics.""",t3_reilq1
hp2ff36,t1_hovutki,I never said I was scared. Simply that I don't trust it.,t3_reilq1
hp2fk5y,t1_hp2ff36,"Okay fine. ""I don't trust religion"" is still different from ""I don't trust possible extremists.""",t3_reilq1
