**HYPERâ€™S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#4:** King Woman - Celestial Blues

**Genre:** Sludge / Doom Metal

*Kris Esfandiari* aka *King Woman* delivers what is for me probably the best Sludge/Doom Metal album of the year. *Celestial Blues* is raw, emotional, and a true kick in the face, while not ever sacrificing the melodic doom pushing the album ever onwards toward the edge.

My story is inspired by the literal meaning of the album title, but also the sense of underlying desperation that is ever present in the music itself.

**Favorite Track:** Coil

**Album Rating:** 10/10",t3_rgzn3c

hoonty8,t3_rgzn3c,The first thing that came to mind was parasyte. The 2nd was a mixture of awe and confusion.  I feel like embalmed brains probably taste pretty bad. Oh well long pork probably tastes bad either way,t3_rgzn3c
