hnkuqs3,t3_rawbdd,i would love to hear any opinions about my story,t3_rawbdd
hnldycs,t3_rawbdd,"I liked how descriptive you were with the surroundings. You did a pretty good job of setting the scene of where you were and what you were doing there. Maybe you could build on the suspense a little.bit like the part you got hit on the head. You could preface that with you stopping to look at something, you hear some kind of noise from the darkness, etc. But the story overall is creepy and leaving the ending where it is SO I get to imagine what is going to happen to you is really scary. I like endings like that. You wrote a really solid story. I enjoyed it! Keep writing. I'd love to see what other ideas you have!",t3_rawbdd
hnp324x,t3_rawbdd,This story had just enough creepiness to hold my attention. Leaving the reader dangling at the end also let readers' sick minds fill in the blanks.,t3_rawbdd
