hpab13g,t3_rkjb7w,"Most of my stories are prompted by a snatch of conversation I heard somewhere, or a real scene I saw., or maybe a terrible feeling I suppressed, which then bubbled out here. This one is different- my boyfriend suggested the writing prompt ""Dead flowers"" after I complained about writer's block- I have no real-world connection to it. ✍️🖊🖊

Do you think it makes a difference? How?
