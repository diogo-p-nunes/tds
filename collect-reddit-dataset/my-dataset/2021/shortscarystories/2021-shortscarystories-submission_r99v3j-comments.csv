hnazlf5,t3_r99v3j,Reminds me of an author called Richard Laymon.  Some really strong descriptions and characterisation my dear friend :),t3_r99v3j
hnbvskb,t3_r99v3j,Why did I thought of a kelpie as soon as I read people dissappear misteriously?? Like I know they are mainly Scottish (celtic) water demons that generally appear as horses... But they can also appear as pretty ladies or just human in general so they can lure you to the water and drown you and eat your body.,t3_r99v3j
hnazxi0,t1_hnazlf5,Hodge! Pleasant and polite as always. I'm surprised I haven't seen your writing on this sub as well!,t3_r99v3j
hnbb0xu,t1_hnazlf5,Fantastic that laymon gets a reddit mention....remember reading the beast house novels with his perverted inbred monsters with big dicks. Strangely seems to stay in the mind does that!!,t3_r99v3j
hnb2736,t1_hnazxi0,Always welcome,t3_r99v3j
hnbb2sl,t1_hnbb0xu,He was certainly unique lol,t3_r99v3j
