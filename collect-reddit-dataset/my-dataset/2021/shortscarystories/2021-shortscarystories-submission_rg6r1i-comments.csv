hoi6y1w,t3_rg6r1i,"Thank you for reading. This story is meant to evoke a very specific feeling of calm eerieness, the kind of feeling you may get when you see a derelict farmhouse on an overcast day, or when you're outside on Midwestern October night and a breeze inexplicably gives you a strange, creeped out feeling. Hopefully the story accomplished what I set out to evoke. This is a repost from a few days ago, an automod removed the post for something wrong with the title.",t3_rg6r1i
