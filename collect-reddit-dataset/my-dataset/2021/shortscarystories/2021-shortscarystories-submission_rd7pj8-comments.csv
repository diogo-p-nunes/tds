hnzaym8,t3_rd7pj8,"it’s your local disappointment here! when peeling potatoes, my mother would tell me to take out the sprouts. she said they contain cyanide, which they don’t - instead, they have solanine and chaconine, which are also toxic. anyways, i apologise for my awful attempts at alliteration.

hope you enjoyed!",t3_rd7pj8

hnzpdt3,t1_hnzaym8,"Yeah, on a similar note, don’t buy potatoes with sprouts on them or have green stuff—they’re as good as rotten.

Other than that, great story! I love the direction you took with this!",t3_rd7pj8
ho1zfkr,t1_ho1wker,"i do apologise. regrettably, some humans are selfish enough that they put their pets’ lives at risk for the temporary thrill of things.

also, there’s a animal hospital which [gives chocolate kisses to dogs due to be euthanised](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vets-special-jar-goodbye-kiss-25100954.amp). whether or not this makes you feel better, it’s interesting!",t3_rd7pj8
