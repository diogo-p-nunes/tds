hnndhfm,t3_rb9u9t,"Honestly, this story is awesome! Keep up the good work, mate!",t3_rb9u9t
hnnhuzz,t3_rb9u9t,"Deeply disturbing , well written . I like your concept.",t3_rb9u9t
hnnjwqq,t3_rb9u9t,"I love a good twist where supernatural forces either switch sides, or it turns out they (the devil, demons, hell, etc) are more afraid of us than we are of them, or there is some other unexpected outcome.  I used to read /r/WritingPrompts on a regular basis, and stuff like that became a cliche to the point I think the mods started banning prompts like that (I may be wrong).  Anyway just wanted to say great job, and I love these kinds of stories!",t3_rb9u9t
hnoga03,t3_rb9u9t,"This is the best version of ""Jesus wept"" I've ever heard!",t3_rb9u9t
hnoumxx,t3_rb9u9t,"I don’t think another line will ever hit quite as hard as “the day humanity met God, he himself was crying.” I love the whole story but wow that last line was spectacular!",t3_rb9u9t
hno1lk3,t3_rb9u9t,This is a damned amazing concept!,t3_rb9u9t
hno03pt,t3_rb9u9t,"Love the concept , well done.",t3_rb9u9t
hnoktlm,t3_rb9u9t,"Holy crap this story sent chills down my spine, I love it!",t3_rb9u9t

hnov0cc,t3_rb9u9t,How can he be God if he is powerless,t3_rb9u9t
hnp21y7,t3_rb9u9t,Great read!,t3_rb9u9t
hnp2vm6,t3_rb9u9t,This is incredible,t3_rb9u9t

hnphpgo,t3_rb9u9t,Oooh v good!,t3_rb9u9t
hnpkyq3,t3_rb9u9t,Well written and deeply disturbing! Love the final line!,t3_rb9u9t
hnqapf1,t3_rb9u9t,"This reminds me a bit of hellbound series, it's so well written.",t3_rb9u9t
hnqcahl,t3_rb9u9t,"This was really good, and I can imagine, even more frightening if you are a believer. Personally, I’m an atheist, but if you truly believe god to be the omnipotent, all knowing, god who is in charge of your life and fate, then the thought of him turning out to be a scared mortal must be terrifying!",t3_rb9u9t
hnqivhe,t3_rb9u9t,"Holy fuck, I have read so many posts in this sub but, damn this hits different. 
Loved it, keep up the work!",t3_rb9u9t

hnqhg59,t3_rb9u9t,i kinda dont understand,t3_rb9u9t
hora2os,t3_rb9u9t,Kinda reminds me of the concept of the traveler on Destiny,t3_rb9u9t
hnnxb3t,t3_rb9u9t,"Good premise, but humanity has already met God. A few times, actually. Most recently ~2000 years ago",t3_rb9u9t
hnov4qd,t1_hnndhfm,"I will surely try to, thank you. I'm so happy you enjoyed it.",t3_rb9u9t
hnouod5,t1_hnnhuzz,Thank you! I appreciate the feedback.,t3_rb9u9t
hno1udc,t1_hnnjwqq,"I used to read some and even create my own writing prompts on the sub and write stories for them, until I made a huge mistake that led to me getting a permanent ban.",t3_rb9u9t
hnovte5,t1_hnoumxx,"Thank you! Your feedback means a lot to me.

That would truly be a scary thing to witness, don't you think?",t3_rb9u9t
hnouzur,t1_hno1lk3,Thank you!,t3_rb9u9t
hnout3o,t1_hnoktlm,"I'm glad the story did its job, thank you for your kind words.",t3_rb9u9t

hnu0r5u,t1_hnpaxl3,Loved it!,t3_rb9u9t
hnrc6oq,t1_hnqapf1,"Thank you.
I haven't watch hellbound, but the description I read looks pretty interesting.",t3_rb9u9t
hnrbu4u,t1_hnq1bwe,"Thank you!
I've been writing for about four years. I think I was 16 or 17 when I started writing  poems, but I've only just recently started with writing these type of short stories.",t3_rb9u9t
hnoxeey,t1_hnnxb3t,All right cool it church boy.,t3_rb9u9t
hnop7h0,t1_hnnxb3t,source?,t3_rb9u9t
hnnzzcp,t1_hnnxb3t,"As of right now, 2021 years ago",t3_rb9u9t
hnoj2q0,t1_hno1udc,How did you mess that up That bad LMAO,t3_rb9u9t
hnozfdl,t1_hnoxeey,https://youtu.be/c5K0znZXIo4,t3_rb9u9t
hnozgki,t1_hnop7h0,"Hundreds, if not thousands of witnesses

Here's a more indirect proof: https://youtu.be/c5K0znZXIo4",t3_rb9u9t
hnocw0c,t1_hnnzzcp,"Well, He was born - as all the evidence in scripture best tells us - on September 11th, 3 B.C.

Yes, it's ironic that Christ was born BC, but the calculations of ""BC"" and ""AD"" were done a looooong time ago. 

Multiple major celestial events that closely match those talked about as marking the coming of the Messiah occured all on the same night on 9/11/-3

hnpo0l7,t1_hnoj2q0,I have an overly wild imagination that goes to places I don't want it to. I accidentally plagiarized in a story response to a prompt too many references to Saiki Kusuo.,t3_rb9u9t
hnp7z6v,t1_hnozgki,you posted some youtube video with 8.5k views and less than 500 likes as indirect proof?,t3_rb9u9t
hnonhka,t1_hnocw0c,lol,t3_rb9u9t
hnqa95k,t1_hnpo0l7,Damn thats unfortunate. Accidental plagiarism is scary and lethal,t3_rb9u9t
hnqb3g2,t1_hnp7z6v,"Did you listen to it?

That guy is pretty much turning the US into an Orthodox Christian country by himself. You should listen to him and actually think about his statements.",t3_rb9u9t
hnql5zu,t1_hnqb3g2,"america is becoming less religious actually over the past decade. and i read the comments you posted on this thread, im good...",t3_rb9u9t
hnrhfwh,t1_hnql5zu,"You'll be surprised in 20 years.

No joke: that video is fantastic, and destroys atheism instantly. How do I know? I was an atheist 2 years ago.",t3_rb9u9t
hnri64n,t1_hnrhfwh,"if we get even more religious in the next 20 years, then we are all fucked. and does it also ""destroy"" the fact earth is millions of years old?",t3_rb9u9t
hns9luw,t1_hnri64n,"Oh, you think ""the age of the earth"" contradicts Christianity. That's a crazy-Protestant thing.

We could talk more, but it's pointless if you don't watch the vid. God bless you!",t3_rb9u9t
hnsymc9,t1_hns9luw,i believe a plethora of things contradicts christianity. and some random youtube video that virtually nobody has seen or liked is not going to make me believe....also i would be more inclined to care what you say if you werent subbed to crowder and thedonald...,t3_rb9u9t
hntff6p,t1_hnsymc9,"How can you believe things that contradict Christianity if you don't even know what a body is?

You're so scared of one little video. 

Christos Anesti.",t3_rb9u9t
hntfurm,t1_hntff6p,lmao i am scared of a video because i wont watch it? lmao that is the exact logic i would expect from a guy subbed to crowder and thedonald....sad. has it ever occurred to you that perhaps you are just gullible?,t3_rb9u9t
hntufjx,t1_hntfurm,Okay. Good bye,t3_rb9u9t
hntujy2,t1_hntufjx,goodbye is one word...,t3_rb9u9t
hnujj49,t1_hntujy2,Arrogance is ugly on you. You should change your clothing!,t3_rb9u9t
hnukb5b,t1_hnujj49,"lmao the guy who claims to know humanity has met god is calling me arrogant? it is not exactly flattering on you...you should idolize more intelligent people. also, from a different comment of yours, vaccine mandates have been in place in america since 1904. did you cry about the mandated vaccines you had to have to attend school or just this one? the irony of someone like you claiming others follow a false religion, well it is quite palpable...",t3_rb9u9t
hnutgvz,t1_hnukb5b,"OK, good bye",t3_rb9u9t
hnutrps,t1_hnutgvz,"lmao at least you are smart enough to not try to argue this time. and again, goodbye is a single word. enjoy your false religion...",t3_rb9u9t

hnv484b,t1_hnuu3lk,"It's funny you turned a discussion about God into Covid. It's also disgusting that every time I say bye, you insult me.

Good bye!",t3_rb9u9t
hnv4fz4,t1_hnv484b,"lmao it is funny you completely ignored the question. lmao and how is trying to help you insulting you? i am telling you goodbye is one word, which you still cannot get right...it is disgusting how blinded you are",t3_rb9u9t
ho2lcnx,t1_hnv484b,"you seem precisely as gullible, hypocritical, and butthurt as any r/LouderWithCrowder user.....sad. goodbye, snowflake",t3_rb9u9t
