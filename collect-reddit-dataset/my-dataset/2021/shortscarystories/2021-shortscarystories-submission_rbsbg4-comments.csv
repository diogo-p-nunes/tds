hnqfkh4,t3_rbsbg4,Nice creepy story.  There‚Äôs something evil about a nice Christmas horror story.  Good ending too - well done.,t3_rbsbg4
hnq54mh,t3_rbsbg4,THIS IS AWESOME,t3_rbsbg4

hnpxzop,t3_rbsbg4,"I'm sorry, Deco, but I don't get this one :(",t3_rbsbg4
hnswdmj,t3_rbsbg4,The idea of a nefarious stranger pretending to be Santa is super scary and original. Looooved it!,t3_rbsbg4
hnr6g7n,t3_rbsbg4,"Fuuuuck. Poor Kiddo. Jeebus, this shit kinda hit me right in the feels. I can‚Äôt even begin to bring myself anywhere fuckin‚Äô close to even considering WtF ‚ÄòSanta‚Äôs Elves‚Äô has done to such naive innocence. Fucking makes me Sick to my  Fuckin‚Äô Core. 
Superbly Well Written, (Obviously) OP, for GatDamn sure. OP has the ability to cause a very visceral+physical reaction within a Neanderthal such as myself.",t3_rbsbg4
hnrtkll,t3_rbsbg4,"This is easily the worst thing I've ever read on this sub, making it one of the best thankfully fiction stories I've ever read. I can't describe how it made me feel.",t3_rbsbg4
hnskad5,t3_rbsbg4,This was terrible! I‚Äôm going to have nightmares. Love this Christmas story!!!!,t3_rbsbg4
hntcxfa,t3_rbsbg4,"This ending....completely unexpected; and now I'm left with more fear and anxiety than honestly expected...all from *one.last.paragraph.*

great read OP!",t3_rbsbg4
hnuksk3,t3_rbsbg4,"Bruh
That was easily one of the best scary stories I've read. The sub checks out. That was definitely scary",t3_rbsbg4
hntaz8f,t3_rbsbg4,"i loved this one!! i didnt expect the ending at all, good work!",t3_rbsbg4
hntmlmo,t3_rbsbg4,this is amazing omfg,t3_rbsbg4
hntmyti,t3_rbsbg4,Ooh this was great I could see it as it happened. Spooky! At first o thought it was the mom until the lights under the house and then the letter to his mom. Good job üëèüèΩ,t3_rbsbg4
hnu0m9n,t3_rbsbg4,Ho-Ho-Holy shit. That was awesome. Painted a creepy picture in my head.,t3_rbsbg4

hnr5hed,t1_hnqwnyk,"Dream of sugar plums and all the hidden things that gnaw at them from the inside, friend. Thanks!",t3_rbsbg4
hnpy7ol,t1_hnpxzop,"Santa isn‚Äôt Santa, but he is living under the house. (Cars made of sticks, actual turtles, rat poison, blood, bones, and an abduction.  Santa‚Äôs gifts)",t3_rbsbg4
hnt27pd,t1_hnswdmj,Glad you enjoyed it ‚ò∫Ô∏è,t3_rbsbg4
hnr79hb,t1_hnr6g7n,"I just wrote an outline so you could fill in the nasty bits. And as a fellow part-Neanderthal, thanks for reading, man.",t3_rbsbg4
hnrdg0x,t1_hnr6g7n,"HellYeah, Brother Caveman.",t3_rbsbg4
hnru1qm,t1_hnrtkll,‚ÄúBlech‚Äù is easy and nondescript. Thanks for the high praise Deku.,t3_rbsbg4
hnsmb63,t1_hnskad5,Always a nice thing to hear üò¥,t3_rbsbg4
hnuoeto,t1_hnuksk3,I agree with this guy. This was a really good ride of a story! Thank you!,t3_rbsbg4
hnslf91,t1_hnr5hed,"That struck a very unsettling nerve. I have faded pink/violet hair and made a joke about it being suitable for Christmas because I was channelling my inner ""sugar plum fairy."" I have also been diagnosed with a few different mental health disorders which definitely feel as though they gnaw at my brain when I don't have them properly managed...

r/onesentencehorror for me.",t3_rbsbg4
hnqavob,t1_hnpy7ol,At first I thought I was the mother but did not expect it to be so random and therefore freakishly horrific! Great job,t3_rbsbg4
hnpyecc,t1_hnpy7ol,"Oh, I get it now! Thanks! :)",t3_rbsbg4
hnqbc0d,t1_hnpy7ol,What about the glow under the door? Your explanation scared the crap out of me now lol,t3_rbsbg4
hnuv7ko,t1_hnpy7ol,Yeeees!!! That's what I thought.,t3_rbsbg4
hnrxif2,t1_hnr79hb,"This story was soooo good. Ngl until I read one of your comments explaining everything, I really thought the ‚ÄúNorth Pole Snow‚Äù was cocaine and the dad overdosed. I like the way you went with it a lot more lol
Edit-sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to respond to this comment, I was trying to reply to the whole post itself",t3_rbsbg4
hnsmnla,t1_hnslf91,"Well, the hair sounds dope!",t3_rbsbg4
hnqbe3a,t1_hnqavob,Yeah‚Ä¶Santa didn‚Äôt get rid of dad because he was mean. He got rid of dad to get rid of dad.,t3_rbsbg4
hnqbjao,t1_hnqbc0d,Cracks in the floor and someone toiling by flashlight‚Ä¶,t3_rbsbg4
hnrzcz3,t1_hnrxif2,lol. No worries. And cocaine works. Any white powder with an LD50 in a few ounces does I suppose. Rat poison just seemed like something a drifter might find in a crawl space/cellar. And thanks!,t3_rbsbg4
hnqocfb,t1_hnqbjao,Ooh thank you,t3_rbsbg4
hnty5p1,t1_hnqbjao,I imagined a dark force of some kind lol like poltergeist or demon,t3_rbsbg4
