hlnpo8e,t3_qzm5hv,Have you heard of [real-life vampires](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/life-among-the-vampires/413446/)? This doesn't seem too far from it.,t3_qzm5hv
hlno4ns,t3_qzm5hv,Whaaaaat.,t3_qzm5hv
hlpyt5d,t3_qzm5hv,The part about her adding her menstrual blood to his food was the true horror story,t3_qzm5hv
hlncxw7,t3_qzm5hv,"**Totally unreadable!**

The red juice from a rare steak isn't blood: the red colour comes from myoglobin, which is in muscles, not hemoglobin, which is in blood.

(Boy I guess heads will roll for this one.)",t3_qzm5hv
hlq2k2r,t3_qzm5hv,"The part where Hannah puts _cups_ of blood collected from her period into the food really took me out of the story. A quick Google search tells me that most women will lose less than 16 teaspoons of blood (80ml) during her period, and that‚Äôs with heavy bleeding. A cup of liquid is 236.59ml. I know this is a work of fiction but it‚Äôs too big of a disparity. Maybe if it was changed to teaspoons of blood.",t3_qzm5hv

hlpxhdw,t3_qzm5hv,I was like four paragraphs in before I realized what sub this was posted on and that it wasn‚Äôt real. God help me,t3_qzm5hv
hlozba7,t1_hlnpo8e,I wanna be a donor ngl,t3_qzm5hv
hlpb39w,t1_hlnpo8e,"Something tells me that there‚Äôs some kind of deficiency that they have, that drinking blood helps fill the void of.",t3_qzm5hv
hlpzc7r,t1_hlpyt5d,Honestly gagged at the thought of it. Nothing like uterus blood in your food,t3_qzm5hv

hlyv5zo,t1_hlq2k2r,I think (and hope) they meant a menstrual cup instead of a measuring cup. Like a moon cup or diva cup,t3_qzm5hv

hlsf7vq,t1_hlpb39w,Probably iron,t3_qzm5hv
hlpzp2h,t1_hlpzc7r,"I know, horrifying thought. And to think, some people eat the placenta after giving birth - I almost threw up when the midwife held it up after I had given birth. Sooo creepy, and of course my evil mind provided me with the thought ‚Äùomg that‚Äôs so disgusting - and there are people who EAT THAT SHIT?! EWWW‚Äù",t3_qzm5hv
hlw6xl4,t1_hlpzc7r,"There was a young vampire named Mabel
