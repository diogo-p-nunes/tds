hm575cu,t3_r2duu3,"Aw man, I didn't think a scary story would make me cry, but damn.

Good job.

hm4kz1o,t3_r2duu3,"I felt this, thank you friend.",t3_r2duu3
hm4lem6,t3_r2duu3,"This is a beautiful story. My nephew had a moment similar to this. Luckily the pills he took wouldn't have necessarily k!ll‚Ç¨d him, but he was shaken and terrified that he actually tried.",t3_r2duu3

hm541lj,t3_r2duu3,"FUCK . this was me in 2019 when i ate the lead id been removing from my pencils . id planned it and collected lead of like 6 pencils, then broke it so i could swallow em like pills with water. i ate like 3/4th before realising i didnt really wanna die .",t3_r2duu3
hm4iozd,t3_r2duu3,"Not suitable for this sub. Why do you think ""i attempted suicide but now im doing a lot better and life is good"" is a scary story?",t3_r2duu3
hm5ty9t,t1_hm4a6me,"Does anyone have a copy of the post? Mods removed it for not being scary, even though plenty of comments clearly supported it.",t3_r2duu3
hm48rg3,t1_hm47iab,Much love!‚ù§Ô∏è,t3_r2duu3
hm4kstj,t1_hm4iozd,why do you think it isn't?,t3_r2duu3
hm4w4d5,t1_hm4iozd,"Fear is subjective, but as someone who's experienced the fear of nearly killing myself, it's horrifying.

The panic comes in realising ""no, I don't want to die"" and knowing you might have to because of what you've done. There's panic in having to tell people what you did, what would they think of you? What if it really is the end because of your stupid actions?

Suicide is scary. Especially if you realise you don't want to. Because I have.",t3_r2duu3
hm8ikdi,t1_hm5ty9t,"op [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/r30s9w/youre_getting_better/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) it to another sub, it‚Äôs a great story, just not a good fit here is all, more appropriate for the other sub they posted on",t3_r2duu3
hm4llgw,t1_hm4kstj,"because its not fucking scary, duh. a story about recovering from a suicide attempt isn't scary. ""wooaah he said he's gotten better since he tried to kill himself thats so scary shiver me timbers""",t3_r2duu3
hm5la0a,t1_hm4w4d5,"I've never been suicidal, but I have friends who have survived suicide attempts.  (And one acquaintance who didn't.)  Thank you for your perspective.  And I'm glad you're still alive.",t3_r2duu3
hm4o7mx,t1_hm4llgw,"I'd say it's plenty scary, honestly, knowing that everything could've just ended overnight and all that jazz. for anyone that's either been through it or had someone close to them go through it, it's definitely scary.",t3_r2duu3
hm5m1qv,t1_hm5la0a,"I often talk about my experience so others can realise how scary it is. I'm not anymore, but I still have scars on my arms and my neck from where I've attempted. It's horrifying to go through, others don't tend to realise what's going on until you confront them.

Thank you, I'm happy I'm still here as well. There would be so much I would've missed if I wasn't.",t3_r2duu3
hm4oz9w,t1_hm4o7mx,"scary to the person who wrote this not the reader. am i supposed to be sweating out of how scary ""i cut my wrist and it hurt and my parents called an ambulance and now im feeling better"" is? there's a difference between ""woah dude thats scary"" and actually feeling terrified after reading something. if you think a story about recovering from a suicide attempt is a literal horror story then i have no words for ya",t3_r2duu3
hm523vk,t1_hm4oz9w,"If you think the recovery is supposed to be the scary bit then I have no words for ya. We get it, you have no imagination. You can't see the world through anyone else's eyes and that makes you bitter and critical. Scroll on, dickhead, it's not that hard.",t3_r2duu3
hm4pop1,t1_hm4oz9w,"scary is subjective. I don't find insect, doll, mannequin, home invasion, whatever stories scary, but I'm not going to tell someone that does that they're hopeless, because that's not fair.",t3_r2duu3
