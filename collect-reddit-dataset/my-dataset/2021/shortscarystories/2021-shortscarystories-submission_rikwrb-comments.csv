**HYPERâ€™S TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#3:** Ellende - Triebe

**Genre:** Post-Black / Black Metal

Ellendeâ€™s *Triebe*, while technically an EP (shhh, donâ€™t tell anyone), still feels in many ways like a full album, so Iâ€™m gonna treat it as such. A somber and mournful journey told through atmospheric post-black / black metal, *Triebe* got me through some really rough patches this year, and such it remains close to my heart. 

Thereâ€™s really not much else to say. Go give it a listen in the dark.

**Favorite Track:** Weltennacht

**Album Rating:** 10/10",t3_rikwrb

hp0whp0,t3_rikwrb,"This was masterful, the misdirection was so subtle and so perfect. The ending gave me such a jolt I had to immediately go back and reread. You're a truly talented writer!",t3_rikwrb
hp2g6zx,t3_rikwrb,Ahhhh damn!  What a fantastical and joyous trip thru twisty land!  ðŸ’œ  Awesome Hyper!!,t3_rikwrb
hp8ccq5,t3_rikwrb,"I just carry a lot of bandaids with me

Cause see if you put the bandaids on fast enough and have enough for all the wounds then the blood stops leaking and youâ€™ll be invincible ha

Iâ€™ve seen my fair share of zombie apocalypses (donâ€™t ask itâ€™s a long story) and bandaids are key.",t3_rikwrb

hozo3zu,t1_hoxmpql,Ooooh a post-BM recommendation??? I am interested,t3_rikwrb
hp6ez64,t1_hp0whp0,? Can you explain? What was the twist,t3_rikwrb
hp6z9hs,t1_hp6ez64,"I spent the whole story thinking the instinct the narrator was suppressing was violence - that they were perhaps a werewolf or something. That the violence directed at the narrator's father and brother were the narrator's own thoughts of wanting to attack.

In actuality, those violent acts really happened. The narrator witnessed them. The instinct being suppressed was the one to cry out in horror and grief as the zombies kill and devour their loved ones.",t3_rikwrb
