hogqk3d,t3_rfxjkv,"*Inspired by u/hyperobscura‚Äôs album of the year collection, I am creating my own anthology of stories based on my favourite video games! Enjoy!*

**Inspired by: Haunt the House**

Haunt the House is probably the most obscure game on this list, but it is another Flash game that I grew up playing and loved. You control a ghost and your goal is to possess objects and scare all 30 people out of the house. It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs fun, and the music remains one of my favourite to this day.

**How it Inspired the Story**

Telling a story from a ghost‚Äôs perspective isn‚Äôt easy, but eventually I settled on something simple: a benevolent ghost who tries to protect the next person from falling under her same fate.
