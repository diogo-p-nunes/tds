hl1zz3e,t1_hl1zgbm,"By committing suicide, he has trapped his soul so that he can only view those in their final moments before they too, commit suicide. Many people don't consider this when they kill themselves because they are very stressed out and depressed, but their deaths often spiral out and affect others. Sometimes, by one commiting suicide, it leads to chain suicides. I personally wish that therapy were more readily available for people struggling, but I am well aware that it isn't. I thought that this in it's own way could be eye opening.",t3_qw4cw7

hl36dtw,t1_hl1zz3e,"I'm glad you explained but this is something that needs to be talked about more. My mom died 7 years ago. After her death, my abusive ex husband took that chance to take control and isolate me and my five children. My mom was my best friend and despite knowing I had my kids, I just wanted to be with her. I was sexually assaulted almost daily. I wanted to die so desperately and attempted twice.  I felt like my depression caused me to be useless and my kids would be better off without me. Until one day, I had an epiphany. My mom died of lung cancer. She fought for 18 months in so much pain...and she did it for me, my kids, my siblings and their kids, and my dad...not for herself. I realized how badly it hurt to lose her and she didn't have a choice but to go.  If I had succeeded in my attempt, not only would my kids have to live with that pain but also the pain of wondering why they weren't important enough for me to choose to stay. (Not to mention being stuck with him.) I still struggle with those thoughts often...and now, they as teenagers have severe mental health problems due to this and my ex (who is now completely out of the picture). I feel so much guilt for putting them through it. And guilt for clinging to my oldest because she was the only one ""old enough"" to be my support system. They've told me so many times that they forgive me...some even say there's nothing to forgive, I was being hurt too.  But the fact that my lack of action and my attempts to escape caused them such mental anguish even to this day haunts me and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive myself. We've only been out for 2 years so I need to give myself time, but...I really don't know if the guilt will ever go away.

On the flip side, they are all with me (except the oldest who just turned 18 and has a different father). We live with my dad currently but mentally I am doing so much better. I spend much of my time knowing I can't fix the past but trying to show them things can get better and doing my best to make it up to them. I was always there for them emotionally but because of the chaos, they were forced to grow up too fast. They got out of it all, despite their father being a sociopath, as completely empathetic and compassionate, wonderful humans. The reasons behind it suck, but empathy is a pretty rare thing these days and I like to think that despite all my failures, at least my love for them kept that compassionate side to them.

I always hated when someone said suicide was selfish, but as a survivor...I can now say with certainty it is. All you're doing is passing on the pain.  Sometimes it can feel unfair that you have to live a life you hate just so others don't hurt, but if there are others to be hurt, that means people love you and there is hope.",t3_qw4cw7
hlad7nj,t1_hl1zz3e,"Ah I see now! That truly is sad. My father actually committed suicide, so i completely understand their death doesnâ€™t just affect them. Itâ€™s like your whole world changes, and thereâ€™s just this empty hole in your heart forever. Thank you for explaining, reading this and now knowing the context makes it even more powerful. I love it <3",t3_qw4cw7
hl0hlab,t1_hl0hcr5,Thank you! This took a bit of time to write and I had to rewrite so many times.,t3_qw4cw7
hl44gfg,t1_hl36dtw,"I am actually sorry if this reminded you of past trauma. I didn't have the best childhood situation ( something I do not wish to discuss publicly), but I had that kind of a low point in my life, too.  I had to do ( and am still doing) therapy, and I learned to attach more value to the impact I have on others. Not everyone else is as fortunate. 

Many struggle and don't receive proper care and are often left with their struggles on their own. It has been ignored and made fun of to a point that many people are often ignored when admitting their struggles, even though one of the best things you can have is support.  

In some ways, I want to try to raise awareness and get people to care about these things more. Losing a loved one on it's own is incredibly painful, but losing a loved one to suicide leaves you with not only pain, but many painful questions. 

I feel that we should try to spread a better message about these things. Realizing that someone cares and the impact you've had makes a difference in many ways. I do sincerely appreciate you for being brave enough to tell me about your life, as many refuse to speak about these things.

I honestly feel that this is something that should really be talked about more frequently. If a meaningful message can come across, then hopefully we could help others and even change lives.",t3_qw4cw7
hl0i73o,t1_hl0hlab,"There's a site I just got invited to a few weeks ago called Uncookd, when you post your stuff there it gets automatically copywrited. I get some great feedback there too. It's linked on my profile if you want a look.

Not a sales pitch or anything lol, I'm just plugging it to anyone I think might be interested.",t3_qw4cw7
hlfmmr9,t1_hl44gfg,"Don't apologize at all. I actually found out the next day after commenting was the 5 year anniversary of my last attempt. I wrote a goodbye on Facebook memories that day and the only unkind comment was from my sister who felt the need to tell everyone I'd been making piss poor decisions, despite not even attempting to be any kind of support system before I felt the need to make those decisions. And then the same day, I get a call from my son's therapist telling me he said he'd made a plan to commit suicide...but the therapist didn't want me to talk to him about it.  But fuck that, I did anyway. I told him I made a conscious decision that I won't give up on them and I expect the same from them. (I try not to minimize when people say things like that but he only said it because he was being grounded for the first time ever because of his grades. The worst part is...we don't want anything other than passing, which is a 65 and he had MONTHS to fix it but just chose not to. So as much as I didn't want to, I doubted the seriousness.). Thanks for sharing your experience as well",t3_qw4cw7
