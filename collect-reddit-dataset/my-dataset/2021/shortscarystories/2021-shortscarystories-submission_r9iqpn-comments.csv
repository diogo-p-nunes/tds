If you haven‚Äôt already, I‚Äôd love it if you pop on over and check it out! All you need to do is drop me a comment with your favorite album(s) of 2021, and you‚Äôre in the running for some cool prizes.

**HYPER‚ÄôS TOP 10 ALBUMS OF THE YEAR**

**#9:** LLNN - Unmaker

**Genre:** Post-Metal

From Norway to Denmark, from Black Metal to Post-Metal, from Misotheist to LLNN, it is time to sacrifice your eardrums to the brutality that is UNMAKER.

I came upon this album very recently, and it ended up knocking Converge out of my top 10, which, let‚Äôs face it, is an achievement in and of itself (if you‚Äôve listened to *Bloodmoon I*, you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about).

Post-Metal, or indeed anything *Post*, is my jive. The genre(s) have fuelled so many of my stories, and it‚Äôs the kind of music that allows you to gently drift away, or, in the case of *Unmaker*, not so gently.

Sure, there are breaks, but more than anything else, *Unmaker* is an unrelenting assault on all senses, and it is the kind of music I can see myself enjoying the Apocalypse to. From the ultra heavy fist-punches of *Imperial*, to the almost mesmerizing outro of *Resurrection*, *Unmaker* never quite lets you go, and when it is all done, when you are once again free, you‚Äôll be wanting to have your senses assaulted all over again.

As for how the album inspired the story, there‚Äôs something lurking underneath the obvious brutality of the music, a hint or a feeling of something dark and odious, unholy maybe, and once I‚Äôd tapped into that idea, I imagined this very vivid scene of a dinner table set in a tunnel. And who doesn‚Äôt like some casual cannibalism on a Sunday?

I know I do!

**Favorite Track:** I‚Äôve always believed that Post-Anything albums should be experienced as a singular entity, so there are no favorites here. Or rather, they‚Äôre all my favorite track(s).

**Album Rating:** 97% Post-Apocalyptic Brutality",t3_r9iqpn
