2) how long are the shifts?

hltu7o8,t1_hltu6j2,">Queen of England

Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc?

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

hltmsjb,t1_hltlauv,"The worst is that the same people are posting, spewing their trash stories, making series that never end, just repeating the same points, twists and tropes over and over. 

And some newcomers see that and think ""I've met my people"" and decide they should also make some non-sensical stories üò≠ and the comments are somehow always positive !",t3_r0cz05

hluz3yj,t1_hltmsjb,I'm glad they got their own sub. I was tired of seeing them on here all the time. Way too repetitive,t3_r0cz05
hltn0bv,t1_hltmsjb,"It actually wasn't like this a few months ago. There are some actually good stories on there, but they are scarce and far between.",t3_r0cz05
hltpz4q,t1_hltn0bv,"Actually it started to become like that a while ago. That's when I decided to stop digging through the trash because it wasn't worth it anymore. I assume most good writers did because it wasn't rewarding, and if some stayed, good luck finding their stories. 

I hadn't been there in a few. Now that I'm taking a peek though, it's worse. Tenfold !

I don't know how you'd even begin to fix this. Upvotes should do it because ""No, stop, you can't post anymore"" would be harsh as hell. But fuck, literally half the stories are (real quotes) ""Do not look out the window at night. If you do, it would be best for you to just k1ll yourself. Trust me, it‚Äôs much less painful than what happens if it sees you."" 

And some are ""You will always be in my radar. I know your action no matter what you do. Please be careful hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.""

 Or

 ""2.1 if you see a man who wear white suit Walk up to him and tell him you'll get some water if you take me out of this place then you'll realize that he's brought out wherever it is, it's the outside world when you see it, so spit the blood in a bottle or a bowl and put it on while yelling that your water has arrived""

And they're always as upvoted with positive comments as someone who's making an effort",t3_r0cz05
