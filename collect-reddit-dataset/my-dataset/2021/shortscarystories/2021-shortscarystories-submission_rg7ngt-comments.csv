hoicbrw,t3_rg7ngt,"Western horror influenced by the Amigara Fault by Junji Ito, Colonial resource exploitation of Africa, greed and the [Ashanti Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire).  

Fun tidbit: after the Ashanti defeated the British Empire twice in the Anglo-Ashanti Wars, British General, Sir Charles MacCarthy’s skull was kept and  turned into a gold-rimmed drinking cup. If that isn’t the badass, metal-as-fuck fact of the week, I don’t know what is. 

Happy Tuesday. More tomorrow.",t3_rg7ngt
hoiew0o,t3_rg7ngt,Fantastic read. Retribution tales Rock!,t3_rg7ngt
hok3cca,t3_rg7ngt,"Write a book, man! This is awesome!",t3_rg7ngt
hok5wj0,t3_rg7ngt,Easily the most unique writer on here my friend! 👏,t3_rg7ngt
hokcnli,t3_rg7ngt,"Oooh, this is one my new favorites! I really like the way it’s written - it sounds very Western to me. “Wide as a drunkard’s aim” is a particularly nice turn of phrase. 

And any reference to that cursed Junji Ito book is inevitably going to be horrifying.",t3_rg7ngt
hoik3ag,t3_rg7ngt,Love reading these!,t3_rg7ngt
hok9mwf,t3_rg7ngt,Loved this! So atmospheric and well written.,t3_rg7ngt
hoidbin,t1_hoicbrw,"That is fun. So is the read.

Happy Tuesday back at ya!",t3_rg7ngt
hojgqsd,t1_hoicbrw,Oh god Amigara Fault gave me chills but I couldn’t stop reading it. And that is indeed badass. The Council of Llamas has decreed it so.,t3_rg7ngt
hoiqtv8,t1_hoiew0o,More ore less 😅,t3_rg7ngt
hol7jge,t1_hok3cca,I have the patience for a novella. Maybe. But thanks! 😄,t3_rg7ngt
hol8seg,t1_hok5wj0,"Aww thanks, pal! But I take all my ideas from a dead man’s dreams. His name was Lewis, an eccentric hatmaker who swilled Mercury like mana. He died quite insane, syphilitic too, as most hatters are (with all the whooring). He only wrote one thing in life—an epitaph for the headstone of a man he didn’t know. It said “Here lies a man who only tells truths”.  Strange, right?  Well that’s Lewis for you. 🙃",t3_rg7ngt
hol92rq,t1_hokcnli,"I bow to the masters of the craft and Ito has such a way with insanity. Glad you liked my folksy word-cobbling, Eliza! (and Peggy!)",t3_rg7ngt
hoiqz5t,t1_hoik3ag,"Much appreciated, OC!",t3_rg7ngt
hol9v94,t1_hok9mwf,Thanks NC! I had been working on a gritty post apocalyptic dust wanderer story at the same time. “Few Whitecaps still patrolled the old checkpoints along the Middlemarch—the barren stretch of bone-ash that ran between the townships and the haven cities of the west.”  That kind of thing. I might finish it over on shortscifi.,t3_rg7ngt
hoiqeir,t1_hoidbin,Thanks simba!,t3_rg7ngt
