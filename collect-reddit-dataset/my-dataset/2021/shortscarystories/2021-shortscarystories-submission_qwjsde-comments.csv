I've read a couple like this, one about a girl stabbing you and saying, ""Don't Open the Door"" and then you awakening and promptly opening the door, there's the ""thing in mommy's skin will wake up"" one, there's a two sentence horror story done the same way. I love all of them, and yours is now at the top of the list.",t3_qwjsde
