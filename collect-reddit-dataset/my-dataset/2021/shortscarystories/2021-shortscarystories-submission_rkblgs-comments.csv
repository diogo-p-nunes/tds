hp98bal,t3_rkblgs,I was half expecting the subject of his job to be the night shift worker and the end made me chuckle. I enjoy this type of narrative where what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is turned on its head. Nicely done!,t3_rkblgs
hp9l42y,t3_rkblgs,"I always love the characters in your universe. Each one has their own little quirks and personality. There are so many I really don't know how you keep all of them straight. Have you named the universe yet? You may have and I've forgotten so would you kindly remind me please? If not then you do you.

What I would like to see in your world is so.e turmoil and something very evil come along and tear someone up. Even though that would be terribly sadüò•

Great work yet again. Thanks for another wonderful installment in the Crazy Clod Universe!!!",t3_rkblgs
hp9knjv,t3_rkblgs,"The real horror here is how you purposely wrote,  ""business partner, not the gross kind.""",t3_rkblgs
hp8y40v,t3_rkblgs,I don‚Äôt get it,t3_rkblgs
hpa6wyp,t3_rkblgs,Really enjoyed. Loved the character. Rare to see ND explained so eloquently. So intriguing‚Ä¶ so now just wanna hear more about their job.,t3_rkblgs
hp8rpmy,t3_rkblgs,Yep.,t3_rkblgs
hpbe4zf,t3_rkblgs,But what was the scary part of this short story?,t3_rkblgs
hp8r7rv,t3_rkblgs,"Thanks for reading! If you like stories about Seattle coffee, gifted children, and relatively normal jobs, there are plenty of those at r/RandomClodWrites!",t3_rkblgs
hpb9mpf,t3_rkblgs,"While it isn't scary for me, it is super interesting!
I would love to read a novel about this if you ever write one!",t3_rkblgs
hpbjj9m,t3_rkblgs,This should be a novel. Or a series of them. I love this character.,t3_rkblgs
hpa1da6,t3_rkblgs,I love this!,t3_rkblgs
hp9568e,t3_rkblgs,"A little Frank Milleresque, wouldn't you agree?
I'm not saying it wasn't great, because it was.",t3_rkblgs
hpbp1q9,t3_rkblgs,"If that was a serious question, the story itself clarified it with the next few parts. No need to make it sound like you are shaming such acts between people. If the partner had been male it would also have made it sound homophobic. These are just things to consider when you are writing from the point of view of a character, it doesn't always come off as the character and not the writer.",t3_rkblgs
hp993hq,t1_hp98bal,"Thanks a lot! My normal is often others' strange, so it's fun to draw on that.",t3_rkblgs
hp9zqnm,t1_hp9l42y,Thanks so much! There is no name yet but I will gladly accept 'Crazy Clod Universe' till I can think of something better. Thanks again friend!,t3_rkblgs
hp9mg2j,t1_hp9knjv,I took it to mean the main character isn't into sexual relationships. Maybe part of the being awkward and anxious persona.,t3_rkblgs
hp9zrbp,t1_hp9knjv,How else was I to clarify?,t3_rkblgs
hp902ij,t1_hp8y40v,"Mundane problems apply even to those with far-from-mundane jobs. In this case, our especially anxious main character had his name purposefully spelled wrong by an incomprehensible barista. Funnily enough, he didn't notice until after his job for the night, which was far more normal to him than going to a different place for tea. Any questions?",t3_rkblgs
hpa77tm,t1_hpa6wyp,Many thanks! More on this business soon enough!,t3_rkblgs
hp8sco9,t1_hp8rpmy,Yep.,t3_rkblgs
hpbsyxm,t1_hpbe4zf,"The scary part to an outsider would be his job, the scary part to the protagonist is a change to the routine.",t3_rkblgs
hpbt2j5,t1_hpb9mpf,Thanks!,t3_rkblgs
hpbt885,t1_hpbjj9m,Thank you! I'll think about that. ;),t3_rkblgs
hpa78e4,t1_hpa1da6,Thanks!,t3_rkblgs
hp96ks6,t1_hp9568e,Thanks!,t3_rkblgs
hpbu8r4,t1_hpbp1q9,"That was not a serious question, I apologize if you didn't like it. But to me that quote felt like a very in-character thing to say, and since this character is also the narrator it felt like it made sense for him to clarify, as that's what he does. Again, sorry if you were offended/distracted by that sentence.",t3_rkblgs
hpa01l9,t1_hp9mg2j,yes,t3_rkblgs
hpa7a6x,t1_hpa77tm,Yayyy!!!,t3_rkblgs
hp9sbli,t1_hp8sco9,Mm-hm.,t3_rkblgs
hpc5lqi,t1_hpbsyxm,Is the subject a zombie or a ghost?,t3_rkblgs
hpbxfps,t1_hpbu8r4,"I did enjoy your story overall. With the clarification from you it's better knowing it's the character and not just writer interjection.
And I've been reading the others you have written as well, very enjoyable.",t3_rkblgs
hpc70sm,t1_hpc5lqi,Was going for ghost,t3_rkblgs
hpc37bl,t1_hpbxfps,Thank you very much.,t3_rkblgs
