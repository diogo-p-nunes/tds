I love it. I'd award you but I can't afford reddit coins and I gave my free award away already.",t3_qur9gr
hktj9mo,t3_qur9gr,"Man, now I want to hear about the dinner with Jerry.

Great work. So refreshing to see someone treat zombies closer to how they would be in real life--the idea of decay and all making them less of a threat. Love it.",t3_qur9gr
hksh5oi,t3_qur9gr,Woah loved it,t3_qur9gr
hkw9zjp,t3_qur9gr,Would you be able to just cave their skulls in with your feet?,t3_qur9gr
hksesv0,t1_hkrtlxh,"oooooh very interesting story and setting! i'm not good at getting words out but i think that the setup and the way the story's told is great! it'd be interesting to learn more about the post--zombie outbreak world, as well.",t3_qur9gr
hle4fp9,t1_hkrtlxh,"I'm a fan who's crazy about zombies too, can't wait for you to write more about them!  
This one was just perfect!",t3_qur9gr
hl804lt,t1_hkw9zjp,"Probably, but it's a risk. Theoretically you could just cave in the skull of a drugged rattlesnake with your foot too, but it becomes harder if there are a dozen of them.  

Also, do you really want to get your foot in that?",t3_qur9gr
hlctqpj,t1_hkw9zjp,"I was thinking maybe trying to break a leg of one the zombies(stomping till the leg breaks), take the bone and sharpen It, then, essentially stabbing each one through the head killing them. 

But then I imagine the serial killer would see this happening (source: modern day movies/series. all killers have cams set up shiddd even Joe and Love had a baby monitor watching their victimsðŸ˜‚) and then just have the walls move inward faster than originally planned still dooming her. Womp womp",t3_qur9gr
