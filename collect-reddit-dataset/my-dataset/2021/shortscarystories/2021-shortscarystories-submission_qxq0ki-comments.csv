hlc6j40,t3_qxq0ki,"This is such a beautifully powerful and heart wrenching story. And, if I may, the way you've wrote this makes me believe it is a true story. You guys have such a hard job and I appreciate all that you do to take care of us.",t3_qxq0ki
hlbruke,t3_qxq0ki,I am very sad now. Though it is a true terror to know someone at risk for something like that to happen. If you were the kind of person that obsessed over that stuff. I don't. But I fucking love reading stories about it!!! Well done!,t3_qxq0ki
hld2bew,t3_qxq0ki,As a nurse can concur. Shower deaths. Patients blowing a gasket on the toilet. Patient strangle themsleves climbing over cot side. Well meaning relatives feeding them non permitted food.,t3_qxq0ki
hlbrga5,t3_qxq0ki,This is sad:(,t3_qxq0ki
hld9lb9,t3_qxq0ki,"Great work, really well written",t3_qxq0ki
hld816x,t3_qxq0ki,"I have worked in the medical field for over eight years in multiple positions now and I have a few questions. First off, let me be clear in saying that I'm not trying to be a Karen or hate on the story. The fact that it's based on true events makes my questions even more serious. 

First question: What kind of place do you work where patients can share rooms with each other? does this take place a while back when things like that were more probable? or is it more modern? cause I've never heard of shared rooms in an actual hospital nowadays. 

Second question: If the patient was an elderly person, that means that they have a higher risk of falling...most of the time that is... was there not frequent rounding or any notification at all that the patient was going to take a shower and that maybe somebody should keep an eye on the situation?

and final question: how the heck was the water so hot it melted through to bone? places should have regulators that keep the water from going above a specific temperature, and even if it could go that high, why would a patient be allowed to even control their own showers instead of staff doing it for them? 

&#x200B;

These may have been your exaggerations to produce a better story but if not, then these questions pose a valid concern among the healthcare community that need to be looked at because depending upon how true this is really, it's sad to think that the real horror is medical neglect and poor design.

&#x200B;

As far as the story goes, good job. very well written.",t3_qxq0ki
hlhql7e,t3_qxq0ki,Scary and made me cry and I canâ€™t help bawling how this is based on real events ðŸ˜­,t3_qxq0ki
hlc72us,t1_hlc6j40,"Thank you so much for your comment. I will make sure to pass your kind words to my friend, who is a nurse, and who inspired me to write this story.

As I replied to another comment, the story is based on real events, which, fortunately, were less dramatic, but made me think a lot.",t3_qxq0ki
hlbyw1o,t1_hlbruke,"Thank you very much. I'm glad you found the story powerful.

Sadly, it's based on real events.",t3_qxq0ki
hld4u96,t1_hld2bew,Thank you for your hard work!,t3_qxq0ki
hle2qhl,t1_hld9lb9,"Thank you very much, I appreciate your kind words!",t3_qxq0ki
hldahl2,t1_hld816x,"Iâ€™m a nurse in the UK for 10+ Years and even though Iâ€™m not op I can answer questions for places Iâ€™ve worked anyway.  We still have bays for patients which are more common than side rooms, the last ward I worked on only had 3 individual rooms and 5x 6-bed bays, much easier for monitoring the more high risk patients.  Another hospital I worked in did have 2 bedded side rooms, which I thought was odd but it was definitely a thing.  

I agree about the shower thing, while patients arenâ€™t prisoners they are still in our care.  Maybe he didnâ€™t use to bell to inform someone he was going to try and have a shower, but on nights I do once hourly rounds for the stable patients and more frequently for others, so thereâ€™s no way he should have not been spotted for 3 hours! and yes I do believe that hospitals (in the UK at least, but we donâ€™t know which country this happened in) have a maximum hot water temperature, while still hot itâ€™s definitely not hot enough to mutilate someone like that.  I suppose if this happened in a country where medical facilities were not so modern then itâ€™s possible the water wasnâ€™t regulated.  But itâ€™s a story, and I doubt the op has a medical background, just inspired by their friends story, so itâ€™s ok.  Iâ€™ve seen many things over the years which if I put in to a story people would never believe theyâ€™re true.",t3_qxq0ki
hle1lq6,t1_hld816x,"Thank you for your comment. I am not surprised by these questions as medical systems are different depending on where they are located. I will be happy to answer your questions.

1. The story is based on events that happened in a Eastern European country, where I happened to grow up. I gave several friends who decided to dedicate their lives to medicine, and they still work as hospital nurses. I'm still in touch with them, and hear lots of different stories from their practice.

Unfortunately, the quality of the medicine there is absolutely terrible. The deeper in the country you go, the worse the situation gets. I don't even want to mention the current COVID-19 situation. 

2. While in their room, patients usually have the freedom of doing anything as long as it doesn't bother anyone around, and doesn't hurt themselves. Often, especially when hospital is overloaded, hourly rounds become less effective. But again, I'm talking about the situation in the particular country.

3. Yes. It's is messed up there. Sometimes very bad.

I will be happy to answer any other questions about it. 

I really appreciate your questions, and thank you so much for the feedback! I'm glad you found the story interesting.",t3_qxq0ki
hldlivn,t1_hld816x,"I agree with a lot of your criticisms, the story felt like it was written by someone who hadn't spent much time in a hospital. That said, most of the rooms at the hospitals I've worked at have had two beds. Some had four. Having only single bed rooms is even more unrealistic to me, lol (though I have seen it at one or two hospitals).",t3_qxq0ki
hlcg9eb,t1_hlc72us,"It's heartbreaking to hear this. But sharing her story did some good, as he us now in our thoughts, no longer alone.

I'm gonna go cry my face off now.",t3_qxq0ki
hlcaakl,t1_hlbyw1o,That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that. My heart goes out to anybody who loses a loved one as I have lost myself. This really was very well written. The way you told the story made me connect with the two men. I really was saddened after I read it and it also is scary because of the implications. Good job.,t3_qxq0ki
hldbbum,t1_hldahl2,"Thanks for replying! I realize it was mostly used for the story but it's crazy to think that some of the exaggerations might be true. Thanks for all the details. I knew about bays, but I didn't know that there were some hospitals in our current time that still had 2 person rooms. That's crazy. 

I too have stories that people wouldn't believe if I told them. Thanks again for the reply! found it very helpful.",t3_qxq0ki
hle2vr4,t1_hldahl2,"Thank you for your comment, and THANK YOU for your hard work!",t3_qxq0ki
hle2pac,t1_hldlivn,"You are right, I don't have much experience of being hospitalized (phew!).

However, I have spent quite a bit of time in hospitals as I have a few friends who work there. Having several people in the same room is a very common situation there, but of course everyone there has their own bed.

As I mentioned in another comment here, the hospital described in the story is located in an Easter European country. Unfortunately, the quality of medical systems in various places often is very different, and sometimes the difference is horrifying.",t3_qxq0ki
hldmxsv,t1_hldlivn,Wow thatâ€™s weird to me. 4 person rooms? Thatâ€™s a recipe for disaster,t3_qxq0ki
hlcghsv,t1_hlcg9eb,Thank you for your comment. And take it easy!,t3_qxq0ki
hlexqp4,t1_hldmxsv,4 person rooms are the worst. Especially on maternity wards. All 4 people there with newborns. Awful.,t3_qxq0ki
