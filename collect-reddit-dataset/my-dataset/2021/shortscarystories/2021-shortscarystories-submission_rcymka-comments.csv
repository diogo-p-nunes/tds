hnzvrme,t3_rcymka,"I think it would have ended nicely on his promise to kill the person who did it. The ending is clear from there, and it would end with a stronger impact than what you currently have. I love the story, though! Perhaps adding some examples of promises he kept could help the pace as well.",t3_rcymka
ho00ybj,t3_rcymka,"Jesus H Christ, lol. Taking overprotective to a whole 'nother level there. Like someone else said, I think the ending would've been a little more impactful if it ended at 

*A few minutes later, he came out of the kitchen with a large knife. I looked at him, eyes wide. He started to walk towards me, with dead eyes.*",t3_rcymka
hnzg1xq,t3_rcymka,"Well Mr Boyfriend, if you're the kind of person who literally keeps all their promises, maybe you should not use that word so lightly, huh",t3_rcymka
hnyaq17,t3_rcymka,I really liked this! Good one!,t3_rcymka
hny7lot,t3_rcymka,"I liked it! Nobody better downvote this, I promise!!",t3_rcymka
ho26sxz,t3_rcymka,"I read ""over obsessive"" as ""over obese"" and I was confused on how it contributed to the story",t3_rcymka
ho6v7lk,t3_rcymka,promises are dangerous... very well written,t3_rcymka
hnzpi8v,t1_hnxvw41,Very well written but the ending was obvious when she mentioned self harm.,t3_rcymka
ho04fla,t1_ho00ybj,Thank you! Youâ€™re right. Noted,t3_rcymka
hobft2j,t1_ho6v7lk,Thank you! Itâ€™s my first scary story lol,t3_rcymka
hnzrukp,t1_hnzpi8v,How would I make it less obvious?,t3_rcymka
ho1xn4p,t1_ho04fla,"Personally, I donâ€™t think it needs any changes. It is so powerful in the strikingly short amount of time it took to read. Great job!",t3_rcymka
ho06tdg,t1_hnzrukp,"Not saying this is how you should have done it but you could have the boyfriend mention earlier on ""I love you so much, I'd do anything for you. If anyone every hurt you, I'd kill them."" Then end the story with her removing her tank top and him asking ""who did this?""   
*He always keeps his promises* or *He kept his promise*",t3_rcymka
ho139f4,t1_ho06tdg,I love this!,t3_rcymka
