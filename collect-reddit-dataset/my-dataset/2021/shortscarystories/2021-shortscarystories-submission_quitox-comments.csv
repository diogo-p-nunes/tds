hktatc3,t3_quitox,"Oh, I love this. The imagery, the slight twist in the middle, the pacing- very well put together.",t3_quitox
hkr6q1v,t3_quitox,Very cool story but it's weird to read these kind of stories in first person. Is the narrator telling the story from beyond?,t3_quitox
hkt2q0p,t3_quitox,Taste of his own medicine... He deserved it.,t3_quitox
