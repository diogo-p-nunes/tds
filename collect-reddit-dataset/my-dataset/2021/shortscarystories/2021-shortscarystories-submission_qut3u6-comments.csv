hks7ttx,t3_qut3u6,"Ah, SAN GUIN. Sanguine. It’s a bit on the nose but I like it",t3_qut3u6
hksyr37,t3_qut3u6,Lol lol this oughta dampen my stiletto dreams,t3_qut3u6
hkt60j6,t3_qut3u6,someone explain it lol?,t3_qut3u6
hktup0l,t3_qut3u6,nicely  done 👍..and shoes are my weakness too 😉,t3_qut3u6
hkuad3u,t3_qut3u6,Oo this was fab! So original and I really didn't see the twist soming. The SAN GUIN reference only got me at the end. I know nothing about designer brands so just assumed it was legit! Haha,t3_qut3u6
hkv90ru,t3_qut3u6,"A similar thing happened to me years back, except for the ghost, blood and prick to the finger :). I hit the discount/outlets in search of deals. I found a pair of Santoni's (high end Italian shoes) dirt cheap. I still have them 20 years later. So, yeah, similar to this, kinda.

BTW great story!",t3_qut3u6
hksnxuq,t1_hks7ttx,I thought that was pretty clever. Hooked me for sure.,t3_qut3u6
hkt9csu,t1_hks7ttx,"Yeah, I got it, too.",t3_qut3u6
hlrkviv,t1_hks7ttx,What’s Sanguine?,t3_qut3u6
hkt6vkb,t1_hkt60j6,"The shoes were dyed with the woman’s blood.  Cursed shoes, which is why they were sold so cheaply.",t3_qut3u6
hktvifn,t1_hktup0l,Thanks! Make sure you check on your shoes history *before* you put them on! 😁,t3_qut3u6
hkwcw41,t1_hkv90ru,Thank you! I'm glad your shoes weren't cursed!😆,t3_qut3u6
hlrmgmd,t1_hlrkviv,In this context the definition would be ‘blood-red’ but the word has a very close relationship with blood itself.,t3_qut3u6
hkt8h2c,t1_hkt6vkb,"yea I figured that's why they were red, but I don't get 1) how did she cut herself and 2) who's walking upstairs? the ghost?",t3_qut3u6
hkugnap,t1_hktvifn,"Did you know ""sanguin"" mean ""bloody"" in french ?  I can't believe it's a coincidence ! \^\^",t3_qut3u6
hktj5xx,t1_hkt8h2c,"""Stiletto"" describes a thin heel, but it can also be a small, thin knife. The shoes are the most frightening thing of all--a pun! 😆",t3_qut3u6
hktana4,t1_hkt8h2c,The shoes are bloodthirsty.,t3_qut3u6
hkw7voo,t1_hkugnap,That's what it means in English too - the author gave us a hint!,t3_qut3u6
hktlyou,t1_hktj5xx,I was about to say this,t3_qut3u6
