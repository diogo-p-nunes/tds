hkyfcff,t3_qvo758,Does Manny have a sister who is a substitute teacher in Sunnydale?,t3_qvo758
hkya33t,t3_qvo758,Wow.. He isn't gonna be in the sequel!,t3_qvo758
hkyhg1t,t3_qvo758,When I read the word Mantis I hoped it was headed in that direction and OP definitely delivered :),t3_qvo758
hkxwhwy,t3_qvo758,Manny is a feminist icon üí™üèª,t3_qvo758
hkxy3m8,t3_qvo758,Love the hot monster horror gore adventures. Especially when it's a dumb shit that is going nowhere in life and believes they are God's gift to the opposite sex.,t3_qvo758
hkzwp8c,t3_qvo758,Manny Santos from Degrassi is where my mind went lol. Nice story! Love a powerful woman.,t3_qvo758
hkzvanz,t3_qvo758,thats crazy,t3_qvo758
hl1mg4e,t3_qvo758,"I usually think of brain as having a more cheesecake-y texture, rather than gelatinous (-which would be more like jelly- brain is more... crumbly and soft?  

I am of course talking about sheep's brain, in case anybody was wondering- a fairly popular delicacy in some places. 

Mmm, I suddenly had a craving for fried brain sandwich, stuffed in baguettes and garnished with pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce.",t3_qvo758
hkz41ue,t3_qvo758,Good for her!,t3_qvo758
hl23yla,t3_qvo758,Damn. Is the guy ok?,t3_qvo758
hkyo8z4,t1_hkyfcff,I was thinking exactly the same üòÇüòÇ,t3_qvo758
hl8h908,t1_hkyfcff,This is exactly what I thought. Poor Xander üòÖ,t3_qvo758
hkzyqc6,t1_hkyhg1t,"So you got ahead of yourself, huh?",t3_qvo758
hkzvazt,t1_hkyhg1t,uh oh,t3_qvo758
hkzvbqv,t1_hkxwhwy,what icon?,t3_qvo758
hkz28fx,t1_hkxy3m8,I don‚Äôt really see how the guy is any of that. In fact he called Manny hot and good at sex up until his head was devoured in one swift bite. The closest to rude he was was describing him as freaky enough to bring a stranger and even then freaky in a sexual context can be taken as a compliment. Being super horny does not automatically make a fictional character arrogant or scummy.,t3_qvo758
hl0ahyn,t1_hkzwp8c,i thought of manny from diary of a wimpy kid lol,t3_qvo758
hl00hsu,t1_hkzyqc6,Ba dum tss,t3_qvo758
hl0hsnp,t1_hkzyqc6,Hahaha good one!,t3_qvo758
hkz40xj,t1_hkz28fx,"The man is bad at kissing, ignores the concept of foreplay, doesn't do anything during sex to please her, calls her a bitch (RBF), then insults her name.",t3_qvo758
hl0nw4l,t1_hl0ahyn,he would do this. fucking bucktooth bastard.,t3_qvo758
hkz51ol,t1_hkz40xj,"Fair enough. Was wondering what RBF stood for, never knew resting bitch face would get its own acronym. What doesn‚Äôt get an acronym at this point? Though I don‚Äôt think being a bad kisser and a bad lover should  be in the same category as calling someone a bitch and insulting their trans status right in front of their face. He‚Äôs super uncouth and gross, but I don‚Äôt know if being pretty much blindly horny means he thinks better of himself. If everyone wanting something that seems out of their depth (in this case some rude pervert wanting a man who became a pretty woman, or woman who identifies as a man, not super familiar with trans terms) they thought they were hot shit, we‚Äôd have way more big-headed people than we already do.",t3_qvo758

hl7bp5e,t1_hkz51ol,"You REALLY unnecessarily turned this into an lgbtq+ for/against comment. Nothing was even remotely mentioned anywhere in my comment about that. So you need to quit reaching so damn far so you can start an argument or spread negativity. Find something productive to do. 

And remember, love everyone.",t3_qvo758
hl7h1f9,t1_hl7bp5e,What did I even say about the trans community?,t3_qvo758
