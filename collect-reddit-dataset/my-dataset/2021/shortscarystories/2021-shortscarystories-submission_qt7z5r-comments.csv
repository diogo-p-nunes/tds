hkiapfz,t3_qt7z5r,"Oooohhhh! Gave me shivers! 
The twist is Well done! Love it!",t3_qt7z5r
hkict2d,t3_qt7z5r,SO GOOD!! why bloody steak and a side of pickles? :),t3_qt7z5r
hkirm73,t3_qt7z5r,"i'm sorry but i don't really get the end, can someone explain please?",t3_qt7z5r
hkj3dt5,t3_qt7z5r,"Baby proofing solves problems. Get them, install them, use them until the kid is old enough that they start complaining about the gate for the stairs.",t3_qt7z5r
hkiiqj3,t3_qt7z5r,Creeped me out! Good job.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj8551,t3_qt7z5r,Special shout out to u/solaceus for helping me whittle it down for this sub from the r/nosleep longer version. You are the best.,t3_qt7z5r
hkiwlmo,t3_qt7z5r,"I'm sobbing. Sad, joyful, and terrifying all at once.",t3_qt7z5r
hkiir2a,t3_qt7z5r,Creeped me out! Good job.,t3_qt7z5r
hkkqaqt,t3_qt7z5r,This made me crave a pickle lol,t3_qt7z5r
hkj2aa8,t3_qt7z5r,Gonna need an explanation for the ending of this one,t3_qt7z5r
hkjx4rd,t3_qt7z5r,Did Lara push the mom...?,t3_qt7z5r
hkj4kjc,t1_hkiapfz,Why Thank you! .. shivers was definitely a desired reaction.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj4uc0,t1_hkict2d,Lol it had to be outrageous... pickles is one of the recurring cravings in normal pregnancy and steak for Lara. She does love the smell of blood.,t3_qt7z5r
hkizt3g,t1_hkirm73,The daughter hugs him from behind while he's bending over the fresh corpse of his wife.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj5l5x,t1_hkj3dt5,Yes the husband must be taking it seriously now. He can still only hear her sing the lullaby the wife used to sing. Still can't see her though.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj59l2,t1_hkiwlmo,"Aww thats a very sweet compliment, I am glad it could bring out myriad of emotions.",t3_qt7z5r
hkj5e88,t1_hkj2aa8,"It wasn't psychosis, Lara is very real... though the husband still doesn't know what she is.",t3_qt7z5r
hkk23c7,t1_hkjx4rd,Not directly but  maybe she lured her.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj53ur,t1_hkj4kjc,Always a pleasure. I look forward to your creations.,t3_qt7z5r
hklfjpd,t1_hkj4uc0,"oh that's so cool!! I love this, I hope you write more in the future :)",t3_qt7z5r
hkj1i9c,t1_hkizt3g,"so is Lara a ghost girl, or... Cause I'm still confused about that part",t3_qt7z5r
hkjxl60,t1_hkj5l5x,"That’s when he learned he was the one with mental issues, and that something in his mind didn’t let his eyes see his daughter.",t3_qt7z5r
hkj5w5z,t1_hkj53ur,"And I yours, its been a while ...when can I read the next tale  :)",t3_qt7z5r
hklg2d7,t1_hklfjpd,Thank you! Also feedback on past stories is also always welcome :),t3_qt7z5r
hkj51z2,t1_hkj1i9c,She is a creature that the shaman transferred from the doll to the wifes womb. Intentionally ambiguous  on what she is.,t3_qt7z5r
hkk25hn,t1_hkjxl60,Completely possible.,t3_qt7z5r
hkj6b2n,t1_hkj5w5z, There is something in the works!,t3_qt7z5r
hkkvrv8,t1_hkj51z2,why can't her husband see her? i'm stupid sorry,t3_qt7z5r
hkj6jtj,t1_hkj6b2n,Awesome! Can't wait.,t3_qt7z5r
hkkxvz0,t1_hkkvrv8,No no you are fine... it's not entirely obvious what Lara is.. if you can give birth to ghosts then she comes close,t3_qt7z5r
hklfq6w,t1_hkkxvz0,"interesting... i'm not that good at figuring out ambiguous stories but this one was intriguing and creative well done! i think it's really good (even if i don't get some parts, but that's my fault) and you should be proud!",t3_qt7z5r
hklgcgv,t1_hklfq6w,"I am glad you enjoyed it, I love keeping things ambiguous as that leaves blanks for peoples imaginations to fill. If you have questions will  be happy to answer.",t3_qt7z5r
hklkpy4,t1_hklgcgv,"you're welcome, the only other question i can think of is:

did Lara push the wife down the stairs?",t3_qt7z5r
hkll0xk,t1_hklkpy4,Most likely accidental as Lara could run so quickly..or she may have lured the wife to death,t3_qt7z5r
