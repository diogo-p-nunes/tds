A sad, sad thing to picture in my mind as momma is ripped to shreds. And what would happen to poor little baby? I'm getting.more upset by the second. I must go calm down for a.minute. Thank you for an awesome story!!!",t3_r3r6ht

It was just heartbreaking, and this idea hit me, so I figured I would share.  Hope you enjoy!",t3_r3r6ht

hmdxlds,t1_hmc9bi6,"I knew it was based off this picture! I just saw it on my feed not too long ago. You did a great job portraying it. I knew exactly what you were going for by the first couple sentences. Sad, but great read.",t3_r3r6ht
hmcuf1a,t1_hmc9bi6,"Why did you do this to me, to us? I’m going to imagine the baby monkey hulked out, killed the leopard, and became king of all. That’s totally what happened.

Those who took these photos and didn’t help the baby - there’s a special place in hell for those monsters.",t3_r3r6ht
hmgtmdt,t1_hmc9bi6,"I knew the exact picture that inspired this piece after reading the first full paragraph, such was the impact of your writing physique.  And, far from spoiling anything, it was that much more agonizing to read.  Almost clicked away, glad I didn’t.  So very well done.",t3_r3r6ht
