hmygjcd,t3_r6pcrk,Mmmmmmm I don’t like that,t3_r6pcrk
hmyi0gr,t3_r6pcrk,"ayo just for a fact, I don't think that balls would be a good incubator for a spider. Balls naturally need to have a cooler temperature so sperms can be created. That's why they dangle",t3_r6pcrk

hmw1994,t1_hmw0ig4,"Ah, but what if I write ”see, at least it could be worse 😎”? 😜",t3_r6pcrk
hmw1zzy,t1_hmw1994,"Lol!! At least if he does try to kill you, he'll be easy to get away from. Iirc, they don't move very fast for a couple days afterwards.",t3_r6pcrk
hmw2f4d,t1_hmw1zzy,"Hah! Saving your comment to go along with it. I know he joked with me when I was moving at the speed of a sloth after birth both times, so revenge will be sweet 😎",t3_r6pcrk
hmw3geu,t1_hmw2f4d,"He should have been nicer to you! Karma will come back and bite him in the ass, er, balls I mean.😉🤣",t3_r6pcrk
hmxkdgb,t1_hmw2f4d,When my husband had his vasectomy he moaned like a baby and I kept telling him to shut up because I'd given birth 3 times naturally without any sort of pain relief.Then the day after he said my balls are black.Turns out he got hepatitis A and just had to ride out the storm.I still didn't give him an ounce of sympathy. Three minutes before the birth of my boy he was moaning saying I'm starving my stomach hurts I'm so hungry. I said you had better get out of this room now before I beat you to death.The midwife said oh goodness you're delivering.They whisked me off to another room and I barely made it on the bed before I gave birth.And guess what. HE started crying and ran out of the room. Needless to say we've been divorced for over 30 years.lol.,t3_r6pcrk
hmw3w3l,t1_hmw3geu,"To be fair, he took about all of the poopy diapers whilst I was recovering (and pretty much all the rest too), soooo I should probably be nicer 😂",t3_r6pcrk
hmw4p9f,t1_hmw3w3l,"Oh, well in that case...maybe go a little easy on the poor guy. If I remember, my ex was only down for a couple of days when he had his done. Maybe your husband will be lucky and have an easy time of it too. If not, remind him of those labor and delivery stories of yours. It's only fair that he take one for the team, so to speak. Good luck, for both of you.",t3_r6pcrk
hmw5kko,t1_hmw4p9f,"Thank you. A few plastic spiders in his pocket, and this story sent though… 😬
Definitely taking one for the team, even if it was his suggestion after I declared ”I’m NEVER going through another pregnancy again” at around 500 months pregnant with our second and last.
Hope hubby gets a quick recovery like your partner. Eeeeven if it would feel nice if he knew what it felt like to give birth. 😂",t3_r6pcrk
hmw6fvp,t1_hmw5kko,"Oh god, I can relate to the 500 months pregnant part. Those last 2 months or so seem like an eternity lol. I really wish there was some way that we could let men experience all the ""joys"" of pregnancy for just a few days (or weeks).🤣🤣",t3_r6pcrk
hmwbzzr,t1_hmw6fvp,"My second pregnancy was like those last two months from about week 7 - never felt so miserable and in pain in my life, labour with both included (though planned c-section with second thanks to hip injury from the first - do I feel like 100 years old or what, talking hip injury before I had even turned 30).
I took some comfort in sending my husband videos of guys doing the ”labour simulation challenge” (I’m an evil wife, but I did torture myself by watching birthing videos too 🙈 ”ring of fire” downright almost works as birthcontrol just watching a video of it!).  And he bribed me with sweetpotato fries during the first pregnancy - second sucked more cause I was craving just about everything I’m deathly allergic to 😂
Sooo, vasectomy ftw, after the pandemic, when one dares to do nonemergency procedures again.",t3_r6pcrk
hmwghqh,t1_hmwbzzr,"Lord, I had such cravings for French fries my whole pregnancy, it was insane. I'd get back from lunch to work, the next person would go to leave and would ask if anyone wanted anything,  I'd be like ""bring me back fries?"" And they would all be like ""didn't you just have some?"" I'd have to admit that yes, I did, but these were for the baby.🤣🤣",t3_r6pcrk
hn53suj,t1_hmwghqh,"Hah! Of COURSE the baby wants a portion too! And make it an extra large and with melted cheese on top and then a side of regular fries to wash it down with!

For the record, my hubby won many gold stars going to McDonalds at like 5 in the morning to get me mctoasts and hashbrowns (my country sadly only have McDonalds breakfast between 5-10 in the morning! 😱), and then again during the evening for sweetpotato fries, which they had sadly discontinued here just around the time I got pregnant with baby nr 2, grrrr. Instead, I wanted to bathe and stuff myself with and in apple pie - yet one taste could kill me. Sucks to be allergic to apples 😬",t3_r6pcrk
hn54jr6,t1_hn53suj,Oh the terrible irony! To have a craving for something you're allergic to! Mother Nature really is a bitch!,t3_r6pcrk
hn56aox,t1_hn54jr6,Indeed it is! The allergy was rather mild when I was a kid and then escalated from teen and up - now I can’t even drink juice with apples in it without having trouble breathing… sooo not the feeling one wants when pregnant and already miserable 😂,t3_r6pcrk
