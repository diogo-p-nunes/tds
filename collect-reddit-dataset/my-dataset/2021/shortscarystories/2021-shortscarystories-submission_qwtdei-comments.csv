hl99s1r,t1_hl91auu,I recommend getting her a wig for the time being. Sounds like she might have stress related alopecia from the accident.

hl9do4f,t1_hl98bfu,"As a woman, sometimes we prefer to be shown. It's the little things. My guy holding my hand or nuzzling into my shoulder when we're watching TV says volumes over a gift, most days.
 
Also, flowers are nice, but eventually, they die. I have a couple suggestions:
 
- I always swore couple's tattoos are a bad idea. BUT.  We went in for really simple outline designs around a topic we both love. This was a major bonding experience that made us feel even closer. If that's too much, matching piercings are an alternative.
 
- When's the last time you went anywhere, for real? Making memories is vital to keeping that spark! My mom referred to small trips for their own sake as time ""to blow the stink off"".   ;-) 
 
Edit: I don't mean that as a blueprint. It's just an example of things that work for us. It all goes back to building your own expressions. She's possibly more reserved or a bit of a homebody.",t3_qwtdei
