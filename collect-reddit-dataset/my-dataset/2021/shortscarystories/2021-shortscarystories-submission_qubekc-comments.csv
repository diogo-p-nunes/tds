hkpbmbj,t3_qubekc,That was a spectacular ending,t3_qubekc
hkp4h1f,t3_qubekc,Was not expecting that.,t3_qubekc
hkpbwqo,t3_qubekc,Awww nooo,t3_qubekc
hkq5gwl,t3_qubekc,"Thank god I had my personal gun. Sadly, I later found out this whole thing was a prank from the real killer, but I was already serving life in prison for killing my husband at that point.",t3_qubekc
hkrkd54,t3_qubekc,George Harrison????!,t3_qubekc
hkpjeoy,t3_qubekc,Fantastic ending,t3_qubekc
hkq4cic,t3_qubekc,"Ohh that was a cliffhanger. Good one OP!

Also, it's *bury the lede*",t3_qubekc
hksb0wy,t3_qubekc,"Oh this is awesome, I love that it plays on the natural, I suppose “sexist” is the correct word to use, instinct that detective = male.",t3_qubekc
hkpvikb,t3_qubekc,Well fuck.,t3_qubekc
hkpk2pa,t3_qubekc,"The kitchen is full of weapons!! Ask him if he'd like a cup of tea then smash him over the head with your heaviest pan, or stab him, or whack him repeatedly with the rolling pin!",t3_qubekc
hkq246u,t3_qubekc,"Oh shit, loved the ending!",t3_qubekc
hkr7nbz,t3_qubekc,Twisted endings are so much fun. I hope her training kicks in though..,t3_qubekc
hkqb2f2,t3_qubekc,Must be a horrible detective,t3_qubekc
hkq8z43,t3_qubekc,Nice ending. It was pretty bog standard up to that point so I wasn’t expecting such a great twist on how the police discover the killer is closer than they could’ve imagined. Well done.,t3_qubekc
hkr5qz6,t3_qubekc,"this is amazing, love the ending.",t3_qubekc
hkroccs,t3_qubekc,That is a GOOD one!,t3_qubekc
hkse73k,t3_qubekc,More please,t3_qubekc
hkqyrra,t3_qubekc,This is one of the best stories I've read on this sub!,t3_qubekc
hkt2gis,t3_qubekc,Frick,t3_qubekc
hkt5ihn,t3_qubekc,Good story. Well written. Good ending.,t3_qubekc
hkyjlzk,t3_qubekc,"Wow, great twist. Not to sound like a misogynistic pig, but I assumed the cop narrator was a male. It wasn't a conscious choice, just mental automation kicking in as most police detectives most anyone's considered have been male.
It was when her blood ran cold that I thought ""wait a minute, why is the detective freaked out?"" Then I put that together with who the final victims would be that I freaked. 
Very well done. I'm not accustomed to getting hit with a double whammy like that. I don't think I'd have reacted quite the same way without wrongly assuming the cop's gender. It served a positive purpose here. 

Was that intentional or a happy accident?",t3_qubekc
hl2ntcf,t3_qubekc,Love it,t3_qubekc
hkqjus2,t1_hkq5gwl,Holy shit lmao,t3_qubekc
hkqwdsa,t1_hkq5gwl,Nice . . .,t3_qubekc
hkrolep,t1_hkrkd54,Finally . . . I was beginning to think ol' George would go unnoticed.,t3_qubekc
hlffd1w,t1_hksb0wy,Interesting take! I assumed the detective was a woman from the beginning,t3_qubekc
hksvlrd,t1_hkpk2pa,"go with the rolling pin, its easier to pin the blame on someone else",t3_qubekc
hkropuu,t1_hkqyrra,"Thanks, P.  Kind words indeed.",t3_qubekc
hkylybe,t1_hkyjlzk,"It was intentional, though I wasn't sure how impactful it would be.  I'm glad it enhanced the story for you.",t3_qubekc
hkrp2sx,t1_hkrolep,I literally pictured George harrison murdering people lol,t3_qubekc
hksy9pa,t1_hksvlrd,"""It was the pastry your honour it was ruff.""",t3_qubekc
hkyp7n0,t1_hkylybe,"The equivalent of a navy SEAL double tap, only in literary form. I've made assumptions like that before & been verbally chastised as though I'd done it purposely which I never have. It's not something one thinks of while making sense of all the input streaming into our brains. I tend to feel a bit bad about it afterwards because I believe that, with a few exceptions, women are as capable as men, better in many cases. 

In this case, however, it served to, as you put it, enhanced the story. A positive outcome, to say the least. I love the mental dead stop that happens when a well placed reveal forces me to reevaluate a portion of what I've read. That's some great storytelling & you've knocked it out of the park with this one. 

Thanks for writing this & keep doing so.
C.C.",t3_qubekc
hksf4cg,t1_hkrp2sx,"""All things must pass,"" he says, as he murders someone with a guitar",t3_qubekc
hkt1xww,t1_hksy9pa,"""Its true, the pastry knows exactly where the dough is hidden.""",t3_qubekc
hl0sgqo,t1_hkyp7n0,"What you describe is a thing we're all guilty of from time to time . . . men and women alike.  I think it has more to do with conditioning than improper bias.

Anyway, thanks for reading.  Glad you liked the story.",t3_qubekc
