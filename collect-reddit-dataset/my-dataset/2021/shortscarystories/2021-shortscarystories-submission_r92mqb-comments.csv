I know what you like.  Ones that are in the woods and all the sudden there's complete silence.  

Edit: Forgot to add the emergency alert stay in your basement or not look out the windows.  No one ever stays in the basemt and someone always looks through the window.

It use to be actually scary where I would get chills while I was trying to fall asleep.  

Now it's the same story over and over and over.

However I have found a way to make the sub fun again.  I sort by country every month and read the most downvoted posts and use the correct inflection intended by the author.
