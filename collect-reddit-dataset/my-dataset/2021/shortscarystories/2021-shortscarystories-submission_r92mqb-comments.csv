I don't even read anymore on either sub.

The stories have devolved into cringe teenbait with really silly arcs.

It's like baby's first horror story.

I try and read one now and then, and dip halfway through.

hn9xivk,t1_hn9p29w,"What you don't like every story having either a weird list of rules to follow, human like creatures with completely black eyes or too many teeth or too wide a smile or arms and legs that are too long.

Then you must like how it's all supposed to be treated as true but they are speaking in the third person.

I know what you like.  Ones that are in the woods and all the sudden there's complete silence.  

Edit: Forgot to add the emergency alert stay in your basement or not look out the windows.  No one ever stays in the basemt and someone always looks through the window.

It use to be actually scary where I would get chills while I was trying to fall asleep.  

Now it's the same story over and over and over.

However I have found a way to make the sub fun again.  I sort by country every month and read the most downvoted posts and use the correct inflection intended by the author.  I also love reading them allowed to my husband and we discuss how this is obviously true and then make excuses for the giant mistakes in the storylines.",t3_r92mqb

There are some good stories on here still but when an AITA/sub switch story comes along and automatically monopolises the conversation (regardless of quality) I wonder if they are doing more harm than good.
