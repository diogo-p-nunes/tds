hpbqx1v,t3_rkmwti,I feel like I just watched this unfold before my eyes. Great fucking work! I can’t even find the words to say how well this was done. Imagery was top tier. Simba you mind if I share this with some spooky fans? Also let me know if you put anything on r/nosleep as well!,t3_rkmwti

hpcy36b,t3_rkmwti,Well Written. I like it,t3_rkmwti
hpdyp2m,t3_rkmwti,Do all Melanie’s suck or is it just me and this poor bastard that have had the headache of knowing one?,t3_rkmwti
hpbz3uw,t3_rkmwti,"oooooo. I like this! I don't like that he says, ""thew my life away because of a \*woman\*"" I feel like it added a layer of unnecessary chauvinism .... why not just I can't believe I threw my life away for a woman who doesn't even exist. or a woman I don't know.  Just the woman in italics gave me the ick. But that could totally just be me.... I love in the end that we're left to make our own conclusion. Did he make it out of the jail? And who was the guy he killed screaming about his wife? Was that Melanie? Dead and vengeful spirit? I hope they live-or uh die- happily ever after <3 Any great story thanks for sharing!",t3_rkmwti
