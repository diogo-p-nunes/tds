hmw99sl,t3_r6wrlg,"I am Thankful for [this person ](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/)who has written/read to keep this sub fat and happy. They are like the noble mashed potateâ€”beautiful, starchy and well liked. Whether lumpy or whipped, with or without skin, vegan or delicious, they are a treasure of our hallowed table and I am down to fork (or spoon if thatâ€™s your thing) ðŸ˜‰. Happy Wednesday. Hereâ€™s a recipe:

Flay 3 pounds russet potatoes, quarter, boil alive for 20 minutes or until flakes with fork, drain. 

Meanwhile, fry 1/2 lb bacon. Eat it, reserve grease. 

In small sauce pan heat 1 cup heavy cream to near boiling, reduce to simmer, stir in bacon grease and 3 minced cloves garlic. Simmer until fragrant. 

Grate 2 cups gruyere cheese. Grate finger. Phew! Just the nail. \#blessed

With torturous verve, mash potatoes and combine with other ingredients. Add salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle with u/Human_Gravy. Eat entire meal in front of a hated foe and a beloved cardiologist of your choosing.",t3_r6wrlg
