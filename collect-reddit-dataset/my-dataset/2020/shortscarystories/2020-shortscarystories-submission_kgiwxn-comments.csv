ggffjqv,t3_kgiwxn,Perfect Show-Don’t-Tell. A great story.,t3_kgiwxn
ggg3zw0,t3_kgiwxn,"Wow, that story went south fast!!

What's really scary is the second to last sentence.  The loyal citizens get **credit** for ratting people out?  Yikes.",t3_kgiwxn
ggf6yz5,t3_kgiwxn,"I really loved this. Very evocative, fast-paced, compelling narrative drive... could use only one thing. No need to go into any depth, obviously (& also obviously, you’ve made it clear the runners are father & daughter)... but why were they separated? Or who are her fake parents?

While MANY of the stories here leave such fundamental details out (& that’s fine), this one seems a little TOO GOOD to let it lie incomplete. 

Like a movie trailer, lol—I want the WHOLE elevator pitch for this action movie.",t3_kgiwxn
ggfqfp3,t3_kgiwxn,Fascinating world you've created here. Terrifying but fascinating.,t3_kgiwxn

gggdfv4,t3_kgiwxn,Inspired by Fahrenheit 451?,t3_kgiwxn
ggg50jk,t3_kgiwxn,You know it’s good when you want it to keep going!,t3_kgiwxn
gghh4ue,t3_kgiwxn,"It's good! I like it, but I have to admit I'm curious about the bit that wasn't explained.",t3_kgiwxn
gggaco4,t3_kgiwxn,Please make this into a longer story or a book. I love the concept! Reads like the beginning of a dystopian novel,t3_kgiwxn
gghtxjh,t3_kgiwxn,"Everyone is cool with an authoritarian and dystopian state until it's might is turned against them.

That is an utterly terrifying world you've created there. Good show! Have an upvote for the trouble and have a wonderful day!",t3_kgiwxn
gggm4k7,t3_kgiwxn,This sorta reminds me of the Fallout. Like in a strict vault.,t3_kgiwxn
gghzvve,t3_kgiwxn,an episode of black mirror in the form of a short scary story. it’s good!,t3_kgiwxn
ggfxoq2,t3_kgiwxn,I don’t get it,t3_kgiwxn
gghhy8w,t3_kgiwxn,Definitely need more!,t3_kgiwxn
ggi216q,t3_kgiwxn,I like to think it was stockholm syndrome,t3_kgiwxn
gghdfh3,t3_kgiwxn,This is great,t3_kgiwxn
ggpycsh,t3_kgiwxn,"So this is just Fahrenheit 451, but the bad ending.",t3_kgiwxn
gggtkfk,t3_kgiwxn,"Nice, dystopian  like",t3_kgiwxn
gggtn3g,t3_kgiwxn,More please!,t3_kgiwxn
gghuhqg,t3_kgiwxn,China in 2050 be like,t3_kgiwxn
ggksu2x,t3_kgiwxn,Really loved this. Definitely gave me 1984 vibes!,t3_kgiwxn
ggm6f0k,t3_kgiwxn,This is AMAZING,t3_kgiwxn
gh3pvbz,t3_kgiwxn,Strong Black Mirror vibes.,t3_kgiwxn
ggh30ic,t3_kgiwxn,I wish this was a movie - I would definitely watch it!,t3_kgiwxn
gggg278,t1_ggg3zw0,"It seems to be a competition, the way the citizens act to ""help"" the government, like they raced to get credits and stuff",t3_kgiwxn
ggi00hc,t1_ggg3zw0,Coming soon to China https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained,t3_kgiwxn
ggfmi68,t1_ggf6yz5,">Like a movie trailer, lol—I want the WHOLE elevator pitch for this action movie.

Seconded. I need a r/longscarystories for this one.",t3_kgiwxn
gghct2y,t1_ggf6yz5,1984 is the movie you're looking for.,t3_kgiwxn
gghd5da,t1_ggf6yz5,"I want it, but the story doesn’t need it.",t3_kgiwxn
ggi37fe,t1_ggf6yz5,"I love that the author left me wanting more, there was enough structure to set the tone of this dystopia with room for imagination to fill the gaps. Not knowing makes this even more sinister. You don't need to know, the narrator doesn't, you only need obey without questions.",t3_kgiwxn
ggi1lpw,t1_ggf6yz5,Reminds me of Fahrenheit 451 in a way.,t3_kgiwxn
gggdm56,t1_ggfxoq2,"Based on how he and the little girl act, does it sound like Mr Miller is a child abducter?",t3_kgiwxn
ggjzpky,t1_gghhy8w,"Agreed! I'd love to read it, if there was an entire novel about this dystopian world! Or a lot of short stories like this one.",t3_kgiwxn
gggdn0f,t1_gggdm56,No?,t3_kgiwxn
ggl1thz,t1_ggjzpky,Same! a combination of short stories from different households/ classes of families would be AMAZING,t3_kgiwxn
gggdrl2,t1_gggdn0f,"Exactly.  


That's the point- We don't know why this government specifically wants to take Miller's child, but we know they've brainwashed the populace enough with social credit and propoganda they'll ignore the evidence of their own eyes and get a man killed.",t3_kgiwxn
gggdssw,t1_gggdrl2,Oh..,t3_kgiwxn
ggh5jop,t1_gggdrl2,[deleted],t3_kgiwxn
ggh5wpv,t1_ggh5jop,"You do know this isn't an actual report of a thing that really happened?

While that might happen in real life, in the context of what this is a story about, it's pretty obvious that the message isn't that the man is a kidnapping abuser.",t3_kgiwxn
gghkbew,t1_ggh5jop,It's clear that that's not the situation in the context of the story anyone with atleast half a brain can notice that,t3_kgiwxn
