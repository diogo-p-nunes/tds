gh0weng,t1_gh0vfym,"Hi! Well, to an overthinker like yours truly, something as mundane as feeling thirsty can start a mental avalanche that leads to self-diagnose of all kinds of diseases where thirst -or dehydration- is the common denominator. Thought I'd throw that in because, damn, I sure find that nasty little habit scary ;) Hey, thanks for reading, and for your comment!",t3_kk4br1

gh0yqu6,t1_gh0weng,"Oh, that makes perfect sense in the story's context. I feel a little dumb that I didn't get it. I guess I was over thinking myself! Geez, you're good.",t3_kk4br1
gh11drc,t1_gh0yqu6,"Aw, thanks! I'm glad you liked it. I'm starting to think I might even work up the courage to write up a few more of these things I've got kicking around inside this tormented, (not so)little head of mine :) Best wishes!",t3_kk4br1
gh18sgn,t1_gh11drc,"Please do write some more to share! I love this sub, there's so much talent and I'm always impressed by all the creativity expressed. I think it's pretty cool how we can interact with the authors too, it's wonderful.

Merry Christmas!",t3_kk4br1
