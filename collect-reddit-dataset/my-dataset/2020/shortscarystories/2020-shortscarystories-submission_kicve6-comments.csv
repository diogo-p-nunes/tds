ggqef8v,t3_kicve6,Has a Masque of the Red Death (by Edgar Allen Poe) type of feel to it. Well done!,t3_kicve6
ggqfi5d,t3_kicve6,"I didn't see the sub title at first and thought it was r/TrueOffMyChest fsr lol

&#x200B;

ggqp0sl,t3_kicve6,i like this cause it still could’ve been scary even without the last bit and the twist!,t3_kicve6
ggqct4s,t3_kicve6,Damn that‘s great,t3_kicve6
ggqewlr,t3_kicve6,"Ooh, what a great story; good job!",t3_kicve6

ggr3s19,t3_kicve6,There's a guy where I work that thinks exactly like this. Absolute buffoon. Couldn't help but hear his obnoxious voice as I read this lol. Good story. Creepy,t3_kicve6
ggq43wq,t3_kicve6,Family is dead?,t3_kicve6
ggr1pqk,t3_kicve6,Knew the person was crazy when they said the country cares about climate change 😂😢rip tho,t3_kicve6
ggqh0jm,t3_kicve6,"I liked this story but it struck a little too close to home since I have a cousin who doesn’t think masks work, he also thinks seatbelts are bad.",t3_kicve6
ggql036,t3_kicve6,this would be scarier in 2019 but now it’s just real,t3_kicve6
ggqm4l0,t3_kicve6,Honest to God I read the first 2 lines and was about to jump on here and rip you apart and then I looked at where this was posted! Nice job!,t3_kicve6
ggqkhmu,t3_kicve6,Good story. I love it. In my case my sister is a virus hell she’s so damn evil that if she got COVID 19 it wouldn’t effect her no it would mutate into something far worse.,t3_kicve6
ggqwirf,t3_kicve6,I can’t wait until you all go next door and sing Christmas carols.,t3_kicve6
ggqfves,t3_kicve6,I despise how like my mother these attitudes are.,t3_kicve6
ggsb7yz,t3_kicve6,The line about “practically pouring it onto her” about the wine was genius!,t3_kicve6
ggqo5kg,t3_kicve6,There was an r/offmychest post right before this on my mobile- and I was really starting to get upset- until i reread the sub. Good story.,t3_kicve6
ggr58fs,t3_kicve6,I loved this!  How creative.  Excellent.,t3_kicve6
ggr7637,t3_kicve6,that was terrific. and terrible. congratulations!,t3_kicve6
ggrrjkx,t3_kicve6,"Hey OP, can I have your permission to make a radio drama out of this?",t3_kicve6
ggs14vf,t3_kicve6,Somehow I prefer this to the real horror: people who are actually like this BUT still alive and up and about and potentially spreading the virus. Terrific story.,t3_kicve6
ggsiz0n,t3_kicve6,This was really good!,t3_kicve6
ggsprkm,t3_kicve6,"Lmao, this was awesome!",t3_kicve6
gxl4i5u,t3_kicve6,It's a banger lads,t3_kicve6
ggqq25p,t3_kicve6,They're already dead haven't read yet,t3_kicve6

ggrgsfn,t3_kicve6,"Bruuuuuh, that fucked with my mind. Amazing!",t3_kicve6

gimw5sk,t3_kicve6,">It’s my body, my freedom, and my choice to have my family over for Christmas. 

>“You’re gonna get people sick!” So what? I’m healthy and it’s basically just the flu. 

>They’re still insisting on climate change, and it snowed just last night! 

I cringed so hard at these lines and I immediately upvoted though I would've downvoted hard if this wasn't fiction. I know this is supposed to be horror but it just felt like a tragic comedy.",t3_kicve6
gitgph2,t3_kicve6,This is chilling,t3_kicve6

ggq4hkt,t1_ggq43wq,"That was pretty apparent, but yes",t3_kicve6
ggr3m60,t1_ggr1pqk,F,t3_kicve6
ggr6z7t,t1_ggqh0jm,Listening to a lot of the anti-seatbelt rhetoric in the commercials celebrating Volvo's introduction of the three-point safety belt sounds Eerily similar today's anti-mask narratives.,t3_kicve6
ggr0pup,t1_ggqh0jm,"Okay, I can see the “reasoning” behind anti-maskers, but seatbelts?",t3_kicve6
ggr5mzl,t1_ggqh0jm,Seatbelts? Really?,t3_kicve6
ggqoi7z,t1_ggqm4l0,"Lmao thanks! I'm all about personal freedom and such but this is weird time, just wear masks and stay apart, sheesh.",t3_kicve6

ggurm2k,t1_ggur3z0,"I mean if you're gonna troll at least make an effort, this just seems pathetic idk",t3_kicve6
ggrrzt8,t1_ggro1gh,Warning warning troll alert 🚨,t3_kicve6
ggrz71a,t1_ggro1gh,">hospitalized because of the mask

LOL 

Is this the subject of the story? Because someone definitely needs a hospital. They can keep all those nasty sheep away from you inside the psych ward.",t3_kicve6
ggux2wc,t1_ggro1gh,OMG the guy from the story is here in the comments this is so exciting,t3_kicve6
ggspze7,t1_ggro1gh,"Yeah ok, fucking idiot.",t3_kicve6
ggqfvrg,t1_ggq4853,"Replying ""Yee"" instead of ""Yes"" has this comedic positivity to it, saying he asked whether or not a family was dead.",t3_kicve6

ggqkot6,t1_ggq4hkt,"Seriously though, halfway through the story it was apparent",t3_kicve6
ggr7eyx,t1_ggr6z7t,I know I’ve seen those advertisements. I mentioned that to him because I’ve read articles about that a while back and he said it was a big PR stunt by Volvo to make themselves look good by giving it away and everyone fell for it. Eventually they realized they were wrong but too far in to admit it so they went with it and everyone is brainwashed so they believe it. For the record I personally believe and know that seatbelts save lives.,t3_kicve6
ggr7kx4,t1_ggr0pup,"I know he said they do more harm then good and while they do increase the amount of injuries in car accidents since they were made, they drastically reduced the amount of deaths ever since their invention. Well that’s what we found out when we researched it together. He did the searching though, I still think he believes in it, haven’t contacted him since October.",t3_kicve6
ggr7506,t1_ggr5mzl,"I’m just as surprised, he said it offhand during dinner at his place and everyone (his family) just sighed. He’s an all A student because he’s genuinely smart and has similar interests as me. He got me into reading and video game franchises that I like a lot back then and still do today.",t3_kicve6

ggqu2qi,t1_ggqrlqh,The first ‘Yee’ didn’t get me but the second one did. Thank you.,t3_kicve6
gwxxd04,t1_ggqmdax,Hahahaha! I wish I had an award to give you!,t3_kicve6
ggs85i4,t1_ggs81nx,"I’ll check in with him after my Drs appointment tomorrow. I’m 99% sure he’s still alive because my mom is in contact with his father,her brother pretty regularly and the last time they had a long conversation was 1 week ago over the phone.

Edit:Words,spelling, and clarification.",t3_kicve6
