gfjkrqy,t3_kbqvvy,What a *fresh* idea that was nicely *fleshed* out!,t3_kbqvvy
gfkvyda,t3_kbqvvy,"Is it bad that I grinned at the ending because I had a feeling that’s what the twist would be?

That raises the question, though... is the killer a vegan or an omnivore? Because while he *is* technically eating vegetables, they’re very meaty.",t3_kbqvvy
gfkj8q8,t3_kbqvvy,This was great!,t3_kbqvvy
gflqdf2,t3_kbqvvy,"Upon reading the title, Salad Fingers came to my mind.",t3_kbqvvy
gfl0lp1,t3_kbqvvy,Brilliant.,t3_kbqvvy
gflff6h,t3_kbqvvy,Cool. You really are what you eat. I'm a potato,t3_kbqvvy
gfl7kik,t3_kbqvvy,Ok this might be one of my favorite,t3_kbqvvy
gfl9f9t,t3_kbqvvy,I love this,t3_kbqvvy
gfoou54,t3_kbqvvy,I am really entertained from reading this. Thanks!,t3_kbqvvy
gfp38ts,t3_kbqvvy,r/eatcheapandhealthy,t3_kbqvvy
gfjp1oq,t1_gfjkrqy,Thank you! I'm glad to hear it meats your expectations.,t3_kbqvvy
gfkwkpi,t1_gfkvyda,"Pat yourself on the back, for sure. Technically he's a carnivore, but he's fooled himself into believing he's vegan. This guy doesn't consider his victims meat in any way, shape, or form, but they are completely ""salad"" in his mind, since they only eat plant matter.",t3_kbqvvy
gflw30n,t1_gfkvyda,About half way through I got worried that he was eating people that have been paralyzed. I’m really glad I was wrong,t3_kbqvvy
gfkjfz2,t1_gfkj8q8,Thank you!,t3_kbqvvy
gflqike,t1_gflqdf2,"This seems familiar, but I forget what it is.",t3_kbqvvy

gfox65u,t1_gfoou54,"Glad to hear it. You're welcome, and thank you!",t3_kbqvvy
gfp3idp,t1_gfp38ts,Lol! Nicely done.,t3_kbqvvy
gfl9umr,t1_gfjp1oq,"funny pun lol, it really *kicked* me right in the gut!",t3_kbqvvy
gfkylbp,t1_gfkwkpi,Then if he thinks he’s vegan then doesn’t that make him a salad?,t3_kbqvvy
gflxy6k,t1_gflw30n,That would have been disturbing in the best way possible.,t3_kbqvvy
gflwp5r,t1_gflqike,It’s a short series by David firth. Each episode is a few minutes long but I think they progressively get longer. I’m not sure if the no link thing counts for comments too but I can dm you the link. I highly recommend watching it.,t3_kbqvvy
gflgi9o,t1_gflga87,What are you?,t3_kbqvvy
gfkyvyn,t1_gfkylbp,"Yes, he had thought he was a salad until one of his victims convinced him otherwise, as I mentioned at the end.",t3_kbqvvy
gflxqxm,t1_gflwp5r,Send it. Thanks!,t3_kbqvvy
gflysgo,t1_gflwp5r,L M A OOOOOOO!!!!!!!! The internet: it be weird out there...,t3_kbqvvy
gflgolp,t1_gflgi9o,"TBH, the last thing I ate today was a salad, so...",t3_kbqvvy
gflguff,t1_gflgolp,Did you have to convince them they were a salad?,t3_kbqvvy
gflird5,t1_gflguff,Haha...no. It was your garden-variety salad.,t3_kbqvvy
gflix2m,t1_gflird5,My favorite salad is tuna. We have a particular recipe,t3_kbqvvy
gflj1mw,t1_gflix2m,Now you have to share...,t3_kbqvvy

gfmotqn,t1_gfljda7,Is that canned sweet corn or what do I do with it?,t3_kbqvvy
gfo3i3a,t1_gfmotqn,Canned,t3_kbqvvy
