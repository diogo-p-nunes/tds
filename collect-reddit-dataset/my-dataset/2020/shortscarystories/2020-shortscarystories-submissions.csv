Me: Why? Is it because I am destroying you at air hockey 

Andrew: what no... It just I am going to college and I want to have one last picture with you before I go

Me: Fine! 

*Arrive that the photo booth* 

Andrew: Say cheese 

*He put his arm around me*

*We went out, and I grab the tickets*

Me: All right let’s see (expect him to do a funny face or giving me bunny ears). Wait why... Why aren’t you showing? Oh yay..

I tear the picture up and went back to playing air hockey alone and went back and fore to get the puck.

That’s is why I hate going to the photo booth, Because it always reminds me of taking my last picture with him and reminding me how truly alone I am."

I have failed you, mother. I have failed you, father. Your worthless son can't kill a monster like he. 

Soon, the village will grieve. Soon, the mourning bells will ring. They will ring for many days and then stop. For there will be none left to ring them. No one will be left alive. 

 The village will be empty and the bodies will never rot. 
Days will be silent and the night will echo with footsteps of the starving hordes of pale hands and what should not live. And a red river will flow across the land.

I can hear the sounds of what will come to pass. In my nightmares, I see his dreams. He stands alone in my nightmares, *my failure*. He is the root of the unrot. The night that has a face. 

The race will run scurrying into the blackness where it came. 

They will all be like him and he will be all. 

But first, the children will die. *Yes, soon, the children must die*

My heart is already cold. Tonight holds my final chance to stop the monster, but it feels so lost already. 


I could feel  it growing closer, the moment of confrontation.
My path to the village is alone tonight. They have learnt to stay in after dark

There are flickering lights in the windows, even as it grows late and it hurts the sleeping eyes. *But that is only natural for them.*

*All things are afraid of what cannot be seen. That is why they destroy the dark. But there is always a darkness that will never be illuminated. No candle can extinguish the shadow right behind you. What is always with you, is your personal darkness.*

I see the open window, by the woods. My hands shiver in the cold as I am drawn near. I know this is where it will take place. Where he will be. Where we will meet.

A great oak leads me to our meeting place. The  branches part and give way to the scene of final confrontation once more. I stare into a child's bedroom

Across me, is a dresser with child's mirror. I look into the mirror and no one stares back. The child is sleeping as we knock on the glass."

I’ve been climbing for a week. The way up to the top is rough and steep, but beautiful fields lie just beyond the top. The view of a lifetime. I just have to survive the climb. 


Switchbacks stopped occurring a few miles ago; the mountain got so steep that even added them would have defeated the purpose. I’ve been walking, stumbling, camping, and sleeping in incline for days now. 


It’s so hard. My legs are so sore, blisters cover my feet, my head is constantly pounding, but I know I can’t stop climbing. If I stop, I might lose the will to go on, I might consider those beautiful fields not worth the trip, I might not want to put in the work that precedes the good things in life. 


And so I keep climbing. I’ve slipped and tumbled a few times now, no broken bones yet, although my nose is busted up. Blood fills my boots, from the constant rubbing of blisters. Water has been low for days, I’ve been boiling ice that I scrounge around. 


I’m not sure why I’m still climbing. I know it’s only been about a week but it feels closer to a month. I haven’t seen another hiker in days, they all must have considered this path too dangerous this time of year. I wanted an adventure, but now I’m not so sure. 


I’ve started seeing things, too. Formless shapes in the distance, yelling at me to wake up when I lie down to rest, telling me I have to keep going. 


Despite the encouragement, they terrify me. They all sound familiar, but I can’t place them. I feel I’ve seen their faces also, but I can’t make them out, like they’ve been censored on a television or something. I‘m afraid if I stop, the things will catch up to me. 


And so I keep climbing. Despite how tired I am; despite how much I hurt and ache. 


I need to see what happens when I get to the top......




“How long has he been out, doctor?” Priscilla asked, worry filling her face. 

“A few days. He had a rough fall from the mountain, he should never have been out climbing this late in the season.” The doctor said, in a tone that was both pitiful and scornful. “He has differing levels of action. Sometimes his blood pressure and pulse speed up, sometimes they slow down. It’s like he still thinks he’s hiking.” 


Priscilla stared at her fathers battered body, tubes coming out all around him to keep him functioning, and began to cry. She wondered what her father was going through; what it’d be like to be comatose, unaware of the world around you, but still physically alive. 


She worried he was in pain or scared, but the doctor dismissed her fears. Even he didn’t know what comatose people think about, if they think at all."
knzokz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/knzokz/tictactoe/,Tic-Tac-Toe,239,10,1609454360.0,"Chess is a drawn game.

Believe it or not, if two perfect chess players faced each other, without making a single mistake throughout the entire game...

They'd draw. Every single time. They'd be locked in a battle endlessly, trying to find out who the better of the two was.

That's why tic-tac-toe is the kindergarten counterpart of chess. it's drawn. The only difference between the two when it comes to ordinary people is that one's a marathon, and the other's a sprint.

Funny how the one with less moves is the marathon.

It's something that I learned early on. Most people who I went up against would try to outplay me, psyching me out with a move that might confuse me temporarily, but would screw them over in the long run.

Putting the x in some spot other than the middle? Never seen that before!

Some would go a step further when that didn't work and we're 30 games in without a victor. with words that tried to cut into me. But that was their fatal error...

With all of their trash-talking, they'd make a mistake, and I would take the win.

This is where they'd shut up, and painstakingly analyze every single move that we'd both make. 

That's their second mistake.. It's tic-tac-toe, not chess. Putting too much thought into what you do will make you miss a simple little column or row, especially when we're 10 or 20 games in, you're bound to slip up eventually when you play like that..

2-0. They're panicking now, and really stepping up the inspection game. But they forget about the little clock in the corner, ticking away their move time. And it rings the bell, signalling their final loss.

The sweat beads down their head as realization dawns on them, that it's over. They plead to me, but I don't know what that would do, I'm in the same predicament. But the fear in their eyes is clearer than their sloppiness.

The guards haul them away, through their screams and hollers. They beg them to not do this, but they knew what they were getting into. ""A game of tic-tac-toe? This'll be some easy money!"" Must have brushed over the less savoury parts of the contract.

As I hear the gun fire in the next room, and the sound of the blood and guts splatter against the walls, I think to myself...

""Winning these games is as easy as tic-tac-toe."""

She was frilly and blue in her spotty swimsuit, and she wailed in uncomprehending dismay.

I doubled down. *You want to cry?*

I kicked sand in her eyes.

I raced on past, and flung a woman’s scarf into her face. Wooly fuzzy felted tassels, splayed in disarray. She gasped in surprise, her friend laughed. I made haste.

&#x200B;

Ladies hold their skirts down when I'm around. They laugh at my antics, if I time it right. I've made you laugh before I bet!

&#x200B;

Oh, but I have a temper. A hideous temper. Catch me in the wrong place, the wrong time, and I’ll wipe you out.

I wail at night. I wail to keep you awake, to scare you, to warn you.

Stay indoors. Burrow underground, I’m coming for you. Don’t come out till I’ve passed.

You watch me closely, you study me. You predict me, but I’m not entirely predictable.

I sleep a lot too.

&#x200B;

You need me. Your international industries, your thrill-seeking maniacs, your unconscious and hard-wired urge to explore afar, across the sea.

I am in service to you.

We make music, you and I, when you’re not even around to hear it. You give me the voice-box to sing, wooden and clanking on your porch.

I even have a conscience, too. I tried to save a life today. But for all my awesome, eye-blinding, land-whipping power, I failed.

I’ve failed before, and I’ll fail again.

I’ve met him before, this man. I’ve watched him climb from his car, firm in intention, but he always retreats to the bosom of the city. He always changes his mind, just at the right time.

&#x200B;

But not today.

&#x200B;

I know his name. He knows I’m watching.

He found it tranquil here, on this precipice of the sea-cliff, but for all the wrong reasons. He stood on the grassy edge. Like me, he feels exhausted sometimes.

Too many times.

I roared at him.

*Go back!* I thunder. *Go back, go back, go back!*

I shoved him in full force towards the hills, but he stood steadfast. He closed his eyes.

&#x200B;

He was at peace.

&#x200B;

He opened his arms to me, his futile last frontier, and stepped into the void.

He slipped from my grasp.

Gravity’s eternal, dumb, unconscious grip yanked him to the Earth’s core.

The sea rocks broke his fall.

&#x200B;

*The seabirds all dipped down on my arms*

*Wailing aloud at his mangled form.*

*I am the wind.*

*Heed my tale,*

*For I summon the seas to the sky when I mourn.*"

Thank you so so much! Your stories however dark they may have been one of the few things that kept me going this awful year. Your creativity and imagination that churned out wonderful thrillers daily kept me engrossed and made me await the next day for a new batch of gore ridden, horrific posts that always gave me the chills. The Conjuring? The Nun? Derivative works whose only redeeming factor was the jump scares, the sound, and the visuals. But none could hold a candle to the goosebump-inducing pleasure your stories have given me.

But enough of me rambling on. I will cut to the chase. As a token of gratitude, I have sent you all gifts. Do open them up with your family. They are of several varieties. Some of you will receive the most hilarious gags which will certainly make you laugh till your jaws ache (and hopefully not fall off). Some of you will get some of my most exquisite handcrafted ornaments which will surely put a smile on your face....for eternity. Some of you may receive a rare pet from my adventures. Just ensure that they are well fed with human flesh. They have odd tastes, alien looks, and abilities but are truly the most loyal companions to whoever provides them the meat.  Lucky ones will get a golden flashlight (lamps are so outdated) that grants a wish to whomever you shine it at. Just word it very, very carefully.

But all in all, enjoy these humble presents with family and friends, and hope you have a wonderful 2021!"

I moved this morning for an excursion on the countryside around a little town in Germany, where I am located now ‘cause of COVID restrictions.

I decided to exit a bit from the path and move to the forest to have a leak. A small bright point attires my attention after the... well, you understand.

The light was a reflection made by a piece of iron exposed from a concrete wall. Really old concrete.

It was a old bunker. Not some
Nazi stuff, but from the Soviet period.

I was thrilled. A tour in a place like that would have been the perfect way to end this shitty year! The door was rusty and fell when I tried to open it.

The main corridor was dark and I walk though it, well intended to reach the lowest point. I reached a stair and I went down.

One floor.

Two.

Three.

The lowest was the seventh and I was thrilled, ‘cause I start from the fifth to hear a strange humming and to be able to see ‘cause of a feeble red light.

I was breathless when I saw the end.

A red gate covered of figures, big enough to allow a bus to pass was in front of me. A skeleton in a uniform was in front of it.

«Pestilence did his work» said a deep voice from the portal. «Now is time of Famine»

Well, 2020 was shitty enough. I removed the skeleton and now I am with my shoulder against this portal. 

I hope my sacrifice will keep it closed.

And I hope 2021 will be better for you all."

My wife didn't see the humour but my kids had a good laugh about it. When I closed the door my youngest child pressed the door bell. As she pressed the door bell someone on the outside (a stranger) opened the door even though it was fully locked. We were all shocked. 


""Hello can I help you?"" This person asked us 


""Why did you ring the door bell?"" The stranger asked us but we gave no answer as we were all shocked


""I don't like pranksters so stop ringing the door bell!"" The stranger shouted at us


I then put more door bells inside my bedroom door and did the same for my children's bedroom doors but on the inside. When I pressed the door bell inside my bedroom door, that same stranger would open the door as if it was his house and he shouted at me saying ""you again stop pressing the door bell!"" And my kids were also pressing the door bell which I built inside their bedrooms. I will be honest my kids were enjoying it a bit too much.


They would constantly press the door bell inside their bedroom doors and the stranger who opens the door was getting more angrier each time and started threatening us. Whenever this stranger closed the door, he would be no where to be seen when I went out to look for him. I made like a necklace doorbell and my eldest child wore it around her neck. When my youngest child pressed the door bell around my eldest child's neck, that same stranger opened up her chest like it was a door. 


""Right that's it I've had it!"" The stranger shouted and he then grabbed my youngest child and took her with him as he closed my eldest child's chest. I couldn't believe what I had witnessed. I have been trying to ring every door bell which I fixed on the insides of every door in my house, this stranger isn't answering anymore. 


My eldest daughter then shouted that she could feel her younger sister banging against her chest inside her own body. I could feel it as well and a little scream. What have I done. "

""Lightning crisscrossed the sky, illuminating the town centre where the boy was tied to an old wooden post. The wolves circled the terrified teen as The Skeleton King approached him, relishing the ritual that was to come. The zombie crowd started to chant, as the skeleton king slowly raised his hand, which was just yellowed putrid bones, and placed it over the boy's chest, ready to pull his still-beating heart right out from behind his ribcage...""

The child giggled, breaking the storyteller’s focus. 

""Really?” He asked, thrown by the girl's laughter. “That's meant to be terrifying, you know.”

The child giggled even louder.

“Hush, hush, little one… you’re too loud!”

It was too late. The bedroom door opened, and the child’s annoyed mother looked in at the girl. “What did I tell you about playing with your torch to make shadows after bedtime?” The child meekly apologised, but the woman was unfazed. “If it happens one more time, I'm taking that away. Now - go to sleep!”

The door closed. There was a deathly silence in the room, finally broken by the storyteller. ""You do need to get enough sleep, little one. You have school in the morning”. 

""There are so many rules!” the child whispered petulantly. “It’s boring!”

The storyteller sighed. “You're going to discover that life's not always fair..."" 

The child became sullen. “I don’t like her.”

The storyteller tried to dissuade the child, but she was insistent. He gazed down at the precocious child on the bed, knowing she had made up her mind. Still, he had to be sure. 

“Do you want me to make her and your Daddy go away?” He hoped that saying it aloud would make the child reconsider. ""Are you sure you want them... dead?""

The child didn’t hesitate. ""Yes""

“That means a new mummy and daddy,” the storyteller clarified. 

""Uh-huh""

The storyteller sighed. “OK. I'll do it in the morning when you're in school. I will be quick; they won’t suffer, I promise.""

""Thank you.""

The child’s smile melted the storyteller’s heart, but he still had to point out what might not have been obvious to the child. “My little angel, this will be the third time in two years... someone might be suspicious. Promise me you'll try harder this time to fit in?”"

Up ahead, against the side of the store was a dumpster, with a shoulder-height wall wrapped around the space. On the other side of the wall, Officer Conrad had been told, was a squatter. According to the store’s manager, the homeless loiterer refused to leave the area, even after their unarmed security officer informed the vagrant that weekend that they were officially trespassed from the property.

Conrad stepped out, took one breath, and nearly fell back into the driver’s seat. They’d warned him that a powerful smell was coming from behind the dumpster, but he brushed it off. “That’s what you get for not listening to Dispatch,” Conrad told himself, shaking his head.

This smell, however, was *powerful*. The air was sour, curdled and rotten. It reminded Conrad of when his little sister hid an egg inside an empty jewelry box one Easter, a box that held in the festering miasma until it was discovered by Conrad… in *May.* This smell, though, he could taste in the back of his throat, and whatever was behind the dumpster put his sister’s time bomb to shame.

Conrad pulled his face mask up, thought about it, and retrieved a second mask from his console. *Two filters are better than one,* he considered, taking a step towards the wall that surrounded the dumpster.

As he approached the corner, the smell began to sting Conrad’s eyes. “Portland Police Bureau,” he called out, resting one hand on the handle of his service weapon.

Rounding the corner, Conrad was relieved to see no one in sight, just a blanket covering a shopping cart. It had rained the night before- not exactly a rare occurrence in Portland- and the blanket was soaked. “Guess they couldn’t afford a tarp,” he joked to himself*.*

Despite his strong dislike for the idea, Conrad knew that he had to report what was rotting in the cart. However, that didn’t mean he had to touch the damn thing. Removing a collapsible baton from his belt and swinging the empty air before him to expand it, Conrad pushed the tip of it underneath an edge of the blanket. Gently, he pulled the blanket up and to the side, then dry heaved.

If it wasn’t for what was resting atop the trash bag, Officer Conrad could have assumed that the shopping cart had been used to transport food that had spoiled. However, the object mere inches from the end of his baton made it clear what he’d been smelling since exiting the cruiser.

A severed hand, palm up, pointed towards him with one extended, shriveled finger. The skin was a blotchy reddish-black. An eyeball had been left in the palm of the rotting hand, and after days of neglect, it had begun to decay as well. Like a deflating basketball, the eye had begun to collapse within itself, but somehow, Conrad could have sworn that it was staring up at him."

In the close-knit community, she seemed to be the only sceptic. She drove this road countless times throughout her life.

Through summers when the sun exploded through the trees in rays of love and warmth. Through autumns when the swaying pines peppered the pavement with wooden needles and bonfire red leaves. Through winters when snow lay silently on the overhead branches and ice rested perilously on the bends and corners, glistening. But never during a full moon. Never a night like tonight.

She knew the road. She trusted herself. Now her son waits for her at the lounge window. His grandmother watches on from the corner couch, smiling and knitting in the warmth, proud of the family she has raised. 

But the car lays capsized. The hazard lights flash, the horn in constant blare. A massacre of bones and blood, of glass and hair. Of iron and wine.

Recently I've been having - let's call them - _odd_ thoughts. It's like I'm in a void, and everywhere is a possibility that could happen in the future.

Usually, it's good. Like getting good grades, meeting new friends and stuff.

Then, there's the bad ones. The ones where I commit suicide, or have a mental breakdown and kill everyone I see.

It's a facinating place here, you know. Most of the time though, these thoughts don't come true. Most of the time, they remain mere fantasies.

Sometimes though, they do come true. It's never anything big, just numbers or somebody saying something.

But it got me thinking; what would happen if the bad thoughts actually happened? Would I really go all the way through, or would I manage to stop myself?

It's a confusing thing to consider, and sometimes I just put it aside to think another time. But the more I think, and the more I consider, it seems increasingly likely that I would go through with it.

So comes the final question: _how_ exactly would one of those scenarios occur? Would it be a bad day, where I'm pushed past my limits? Would it be a tragedy, where my brain is damaged beyond repair?

I hope I never find out, for all our sakes. All I know for now, is that if anything ever happens to me...

If I were my brain - which I suppose, technically, I am? - I’d want to forget about it too.

It’s one of those old tube TV’s. Strange thing is, I can’t remember ever owning a TV, let alone that massive ancient relic. Weird how the mind works, isn’t it? I can remember vividly where I put that paper clip three weeks ago, but that bulky-ass monstrosity? No dice.

I’ll peel myself from the bedsheets painfully, beckoned forth by the alluring discordancy of his crackling voice.

I pause for a second or two when I notice his blurry peepers staring directly into mine.

“Hiya there Suzie,” he says, tipping an imaginary hat nonchalantly. “Nice to have you back!”

I crawl to the couch and lie down on it awkwardly, not even slightly alarmed by the grinning stranger flickering in and out of the phantom TV - nor the fact that he seems to be addressing me directly. 

“Suzie, Suzie, Suzie,” he murmurs, shaking his head in disappointment. “What should we do with you?”

“I, uh, I don’t know,” I answer shamefully.

“You’re addicted, aren’t you?” he asks.

A weak nod. “Yes.”

“So who will it be today?”

White screaming noise fills my ears as blood and violence and death fills the screen. Faces torn to unrecognizable shreds. Bodies ripped to pieces. Internal organs rapidly turning to corpse juice in shiny oversized blenders.

“Her,” I say, pointing to the tormented face on the upper right of the flickering screen. “I choose her.”

“Ah, sweet Samantha,” the man chuckles. “Your highschool bully.”

I close one eye - the other now a forever exposed tissue lump. “I’ve made my choice,” I say.

“Of course you have, Suzie,” the man grins. “There’s just a matter of payment.”

The TV morphs and twists erratically, the unmistakable echo of saws and scalpels and rusty knives carving into flesh and sinew and bone reverberating through the room.

“Nose,” I say.

“Aaaaand?” 

“And finger.”

“Marvellous,” the man sings. “Just sit tight, and we’ll have our representative over shortly.”

The TV turns off, and I am left sobbing alone in the darkness, every little noise like blunt needles scraping exposed nerves.

A minute or two now, and they’ll be here, knives and scalpels and saws at the ready. They will ask me one more time if I’m willing to go through with it. My answer is always the same.

“Yes.”

Just a body part or two. I can live without them, for a while anyway. But not forever.

“Is it worth the pain?” they’ll ask.

“Yes,” I will murmur. “It is worth it.”

An amazing flood of the dopamine and serotonin, just feeling all of the bad thoughts go away as the good ones rush in to take their place. Haha!

""Honey! It's time for supper, dear!""

Elizabeth ran down the stairs and sat at the table. Her mum put down a bowl of hot soup for her while she took a call.

It was delicious. Elizabeth asked what her mum's famous recipe was, and she would always answer: ""It's a secret.""

But Elizabeth grew more and more curious with each passing day. 

The next morning, a knock on her door woke her up. It was her mum.

""Elizabeth, dear, I'm going to leave for the day. Now, since you've been really good this week, I'm not going to call for a babysitter. Does that sound good to you?""

She was ecstatic. Running around the room whilst her mum closed her bedroom door with a smile.

 Once she left the house, she grabbed a tub of ice cream and other various treats, and sat onto the sofa.

She was about to turn on the TV when she smelt something. A fowl smell. She looked around the house to see where it came from. Probably the neighbor's dog again.

But it was far, far worse. She went onto the basement, where she felt nauseous. She found her babysitter, but she was as pale as a ghost.

Blood pooled under the chair she was strapped in. She was terrified. Someone closed the door behind her. She turned around to face her mum. At first, she was relieved. 

She thought she would take her away from this place. Her mum grabbed her head, and hit it against the wall. Elizabeth tried oh so hard to get away, but it was futile.

She died. At least, she was right. She would take Elizabeth away. So that's what her mum did. She knelt down, and cried."

Inching its way over decayed leaves and dead branches until it dug deep into the black soil. It crawled through the loose, rich earth for some time until finding the mother load.

Rancid, rotting flesh enticed the creature to crawl to it. A mouth ringed with thousands of tiny, jagged teeth hooked into the eyes of the corps. The worm sank into the jelly of the eye, slurping up every decaying morsel. Nature requested this being to return to the earth.

As the worm ate the precious jelly, a flash of memory passed through its simple mind. It remembered hatching, crawling into the soil, consuming and defecating, returning debris to the rich soil. Before that, there was only darkness. The darkness grew deeper and warmer. Then cold, hard light.

Before he was born to crawl, he walked. He had arms and legs and stood upright. He was in a distant land. They sold children on the street here; they were his to consume. Part of his collection. He was the monster that returned them to the earth; no one cared to look for them. Consuming youth and returning it to the earth, the children were his to slaughter.

Holding a child’s cold dead hand, admiring his work, his collection. Startled by shouting in a foreign tongue, and the door swinging open. The light hurt his eyes.   Gunfire roared through the darkness—blood, and bits of flesh scattering against the earth and the soil. Coldness and ringing faded away to silence and black.

The next memory was breaking through a thin shell into the warm earth. No limbs, no sight, only smell towards the delicious rot of its former host."

Thinking about one thing or another as I walk, a chill goes down my spine, ‘Someone is watching me.’ I think. I quickly turn and see nothing, so I shake it off as my imagination. A small amount of time passes by and I get that uncomfortable feeling again, so I turn around and there’s nothing. This goes on for a few hours or so until I decide that I should turn around and go back to my car.   


I turn around and I realize, the trail is no longer there.  


I have no idea where I am or how I got here.   


That’s when the panic set in, I had nothing to defend myself with or any food besides the few protein bars and the water bottle had in my backpack. ‘Oh god I am so screwed’ I thought to myself, continuing to flip my shit. After that, I just started running in the opposite direction of the way I was walking earlier.  


It’s getting darker by the minute and there’s still no sign of the trail or any other people. That’s when I get the feeling again, I slowly look all around me and there’s no sign of anything. Then I get a thought, one that is not my own, ‘Look up.’ It says. As if being controlled by some supernatural force, I slowly turn my face skywards.

kni76t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kni76t/the_thoth/,The Thoth,114,10,1609386552.0,"Here is a small collection of monsters you should keep in mind. You know, in case of danger. 

*The Grillowader*

You'll find this creature in swampy areas. The smell alone should alert you to its position. If that is not enough, look for the tuffs of black hair protruding from the dirty water. When you find one, do not get within grabbing distance. It's arms act like roots that can burrow into the bottoms of your feet. They usually stay where it's moist but if there is fog, you need to run. They always scream. When it does, you must scream back louder. Do not approach if you have a weak voice. 

*Brindlewips*

These monstrosities build their nest within the walls of brick buildings. They are often confused with tooth fairies because of the way they stockpile any teeth they can get ahold of. Their metallic razor fingers and wings are perfect for prying molars and incisors. Brindlewips are said to prefer babies due to the softness of the gums. They attack at night and are reported to leave most victims alive. 

*Montotor*

Others refer to them as ""Top Hat Men"" but I feel this name lacks a certain element. Montotor's are the reason children are afraid of the dark. They drink fear from their victims before the real feast starts. These beings move with a startling crawling motion that is only worsened by the sound of its bones rubbing against its dry paper skin. If you think something is watching you, it is almost always a Montotor. Light is its only weakness.

*Apa Apa*

I was a little hesitant to add this one to my list but a warning couldn't hurt. Apa Apa are a breed of human like creatures that blend into normal society. They often take the positions of a higher ups at powerful companies. Make no mistake, these are just as dangerous as any of the others. That man who just jumped off the top story of the nearby office? These are the things's that put those ideas into the heads of normal men and women. 

*The Thoth*

Back in Egypt, they were worshipped as the inventor of writing. In a way that is true, but writing was just another way to infect the minds of the readers. The Thoth will often present a story of warnings to plant itself into the mind. Once the information is absorbed, The Thoth will appear. Many victims report extreme paranoia before inevitable death. When hieroglyphics went out of style, The Thoth were left with no way to travel. That is until our current age. With modern translation technology, The Thoth can travel easier than ever."

For a minute I was disoriented without an inkling of where I was, then it all came rushing back to me.

I was in the Amazon jungle in Peru on a shamanic Ayahuasca journey, trying to see if this magical brew could assuage the suppressed childhood abandonment trauma and abuse I suffered in the many orphanages I grew up in.

I had spent three days and nights without food or water, just the medicine, and my thoughts. Hours earlier I had ingested an Amazonian psychedelic to give me an insight into my soul. Was it working?

I wondered what caused the pain in my palms and in my fingers, As my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the moonlight, I raised my palms and noticed it was layered with tiny bumps like pinpricks. Could I be reacting to the brew or was I bitten by some jungle insect? I applied a bug salve and went back to sleep.

On my flight back to the States, my palms kept itching despite the copious application of salves and antibug sprays. On landing in America after the 8-hour redeye flight, I noticed that one of the bumps on my palm had burst open and to my shock, whatever was in it had eaten cleanly right through the flesh of my palm to the other side!

Raising my palm to the sunlight, I could see a pinhole of light shining through.

What the hell was happening to me?

Was I still hallucinating on the forest floor in Peru or was this actually happening?

I rushed home in an airport taxi, dropped my luggage, and headed straight to the shower.

As the water from the shower hit my body I knew I had just made a huge mistake.

Whatever was in those bumps suddenly came alive. The itch returned with a murderous fury. As I scrubbed my palms, tiny specks of flesh fell off onto the slippery floor of my bathroom.

My palms were slowly being filled with tiny holes, turning them into sieves.

As I touched other parts of my body, bumps immediately appeared and burst out leaving clear-through holes in their wake.

My throat started to itch too, I instinctively made to scratch the skin on it, and immediately a fine spray of blood burst out and sprayed all over the glass walls.

Screams gurgled weakly out of my pinhole riddled throat as I hit the bathroom floor and watched thick red blood coalesce with specks of my skin go down the drain just as life slowly left my body."

She was from a good family whose minor successes in business and local politics were unimaginable to mine. After graduating from high school, nobody saw, and her parents stopped inviting people over. Excuses were made, and people talked.

“Her mother died first, and the wake was her first public appearance in years. The wake was held at home, and in the corner of the parlor she sat. Her father or one the braver members of her extended family must have tried to comb the knots out of her hair, because the comb was still tangled in her grease-slick hair. She was dressed in mourner’s black, but she smiled and wore the comb like a trophy, gloating like a spider over a silk-wrapped fly. My grandmother was one of the few who came close enough to smell her. At her father’s wake, she was curled up in the same corner with the same arachnid poise. She wasn’t at church for either parent’s funeral mass.

“The cats accumulated slowly. The curtains were always drawn, but the cats sat on the windowsills and cast shadows. After a few years, there was a cat in every window. By the time that I was a kid, they were constantly fighting for window space. Animal control gets called every once in a while, but they always say that she’s caring for her pets humanely.”

“I used to see her all the time when she was running errands. I’d always say hi and wave. I wonder if she knows that I’m related to my grandmother, because she always smiles back. Her teeth are like buttercup petals. She must smoke at least a pack a day. She wears these ridiculous fur coats from the Great Depression, and the patches that still have fur are tinted yellow from cigarette smoke. She must just sit in that house and exhale all over herself.”

“We don’t even know if she’s dead, and you’ve already composed the first part of her ghost story. That’s messed up.”

“Some say that on windy nights like this, you can still hear the comb rock back and forth in her hair.” We both laugh. We’re in the cruiser on the way to check up on her. A neighbor who hasn’t seen her for a few days thinks that she’s dead. We pull up and knock. She doesn’t answer the door, but it’s unlocked. The whole house smells like a hospital bed soaked in fever sweat. There’s dust and hair everywhere. We split up. I want to get a good look at the parlor.

“These aren’t cats,” my partner calls from another room. I turn the parlor lights on, and I see her in the corner. She’s hunched forward with her hair in front of her face, and she’s running her toenails through it like a scratching dog. The torn hair piles up. The hair gets up and walks to me, unsteady as a newborn lamb."

I had never seen one before, and I was very excited to see all the performers and animals that would be there.

I decided that I wanted popcorn and a drink, so my dad handed me a 5$ bill. I excitedly ran towards the stands. After getting my popcorn and soda, I heard a whisper.

“Psttt!”

I turned my head to find the source of the noise.

“Psttt!”

A gloved hand appeared from behind a curtain. It curled its finger trying to draw me closer. I thought it was a mechanical hand that was part of an attraction or something, so I went towards it.

As I did, I felt a gloved hand cover my mouth. I was pulled into a backstage area where it was only me and the person pulling me.

When I finally got sat down, I was tied to a chair. The clown who had dragged stood in front of me admiring his work. I could still see his beard, and he only had on his clown pants. He had a crazed look in his eyes.

“You wanna see a real circus, kid?” he asked.

I shook my head, but the clown didn’t seem to care. He grabbed a cup full of a strange liquid and squeezed my cheeks to force my mouth open. He poured it down my throat, and suddenly I felt dizzy.

My sense of time seemed to slow down, and everything around me started to distort.

The next thing I remember, I was in a dark place on a conveyor belt. All around me were neon colored clowns that seemed to tower over me. I looked to the end of the belt and saw that there was a giant colorful hammer. Each time it slammed down, the whole world seemed to shake.

I tried to escape, but no matter how much I kicked or squirmed I couldn’t undo the ropes. One of the clowns pulled a lever, and the conveyor belt started carrying me towards the hammer. 

I screamed which caused all the clowns to look down on me and laugh. Their laughs sounded like telephone noises and loud rings, and it overwhelmed all my senses. Tears streamed down their neon colored faces as they pointed at me and mocked me.

My feet began to get dangerously close to the hammer. Each quake got stronger. I felt myself grow cold as I approached like my body was trying to shut itself down as much as possible before I was crushed.

The hammer slammed down at the base of my shoes. I was pulled under and saw the huge face of the hammer looming over me. Just as it was about to slam down, I snapped out of it. I awoke to find the clown from before being held back by other performers. A knife was at his feet.

That was the last circus I ever went to."

How long could they really look for his body before they called the search off?  Law enforcement had covered the same ground three weeks ago when it was first discovered that Richard was gone. It seemed like he had disappeared forever. 

Richard caressed her face. His fingers gliding over her cheek, tucking loose hair behind her ear. His hands didn’t feel the same. The warmth was gone. How she yearned for the past. When they had been closer, excited newlyweds just starting their lives together. Every day felt like an adventure then. Not anymore. 

“Breaking news. Sources say that law enforcement have found remains this morning. It is still unknown at this time if the body belongs to Richard Bryant. We will update you as soon as we receive more information.”

Richard stroked her arms, cupping her elbows with the palm of his hand. His touch used to bring her chills, hairs standing on end. She filled with electricity when he embraced her. How the whole world would stop when he held her. This wasn’t the same. It’s been too long, she thought. It would never be like it was. 

“The remains have been identified. Richard Bryant, the man who law enforcement say has been missing for over three weeks, has been found. We will have more information as the story unfolds.”

Richard’s hands were large and strong. A working man’s hands, She ran her fingers over the calluses on his palms. A carpenter by trade, he worked hard to give them whatever they needed. She remembered when they first saw this house, and they fell in love with it immediately. Quietly tucked away in the woods, where she would sip coffee and watch from the window as Richard walked to the shed every morning to gather his tools for work. 

The telephone rings. Richard has been found, they said. They would like to bring her in for another line of questioning. Foul play was suspected, as the corpse had been dismembered. They will be right over.

She remembered how easily Richard’s saw went through bone. How she delicately removed the bones from the skin. How his hands fit hers like a glove. How there was still warmth in his hands as she slid them on. How the memories came back as she caressed her face with his hands. The warmth was long gone now. His hands, their love, this world had grown cold. It was all over."
kn8knw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kn8knw/morningstar_community_church/,Morningstar Community Church,17,1,1609355544.0,"Welcome to Morningstar Community Church! We are pleased to announce that you have been chosen to be one of our interns this summer! Follow each rule on this list or you will be terminated accordingly. 

1. As ministers of the Lord, sin does not apply to us. However, if you see a member of the congregation fall short of His glory, remove whatever body part of theirs that caused them to sin. 

2. We are very active in the community, and we ask that you take part in the events as well. One such activity, is a drug abuse outreach. The more minds we can numb, the more minds we can control. 

3. You are only to interact with other interns during our once a week staff meeting. Stay away from them at all other times. They have their own sets of rules, and you just might be a part of them.

4. Your family will tell you that what you are doing is “evil” and “immoral” but you know the truth. They are wrong. We are your family now. You will be expected to deal with any unbelievers. 

5. Sometimes you will enter the sanctuary and see featureless beings seated in the rows. If they are facing away from you, then they have forgiven you, but they will not forget. Death by your hand is a better option if you enter the sanctuary and they are turned towards you. There’s a storage room next to the sanctuary. Hopefully there’s something in there for you to use.

6. Be in the green room 15 minutes before each service time so that we can dedicate the message with prayer. We don’t pray to God. Praying to God is just for the congregation. 

7. Don’t let anyone play the worship music backwards. The congregation hasn’t been the same since that last happened. 

8. The pastor brings in the communion elements every third Sunday at 6am before the first service. You must be there to help the pastor prepare. The anesthesia will wear off soon, and we can’t let neighbors hear their screaming as you’re cutting into them. We know they taste good, but don’t take more than necessary for communion.

9. The Lord tells our pastor who will be next month’s gift for communion. Do not protest him if it ends up being somebody you know. 

10. When entering the pastor’s office, knock six times in quick succession. That will let him know you are staff and not one of them from above. 

11. Always lock the doors behind you when you leave for the night. Things here have a habit of making their way into peoples’ homes. We will know if you left the door unlocked because whatever followed you home will be wearing your skin the next morning. 

12. If you do well, the internship will turn into a permanent position. A vow to the Lord is a lifelong commitment. Don’t you dare ever look for other employment."

Unfortunately, most people forget that time is an abstract concept, and has no direct bearing on events. 


Three weeks ago, a giant crack ran down the moon. We sent scientists up to research it, but they couldn’t find any particular reason for it, so they sent me out to investigate theories on Earth. 


I go to travel on the company dime, so I spared no expense. I went to several different countries, met with several isolated tribes, and reviewed prophecies and other weird predictions. 


I’m aware this was a last resort style of research, but if you have a better idea, I’d love to hear it. 


Only one group had any documentation of the Moon “hatching” in the future. This tribe was a subsection of Christinity, that split off sometime around 165 BC, and claimed to have intimate knowledge of the events to follow.  


The tribe called themselves the Sealers. They explained to me that the Old and New Testament sound different for a reason, that the thing we called God in both parts of the bible was actually two different beings.


The thing called God in the old testament is an old thing, ruling by fear and brimstone, looking for lifeforms across the galaxy to worship him. He got to Earth and subdued humans to his will, for a long time. 


Eventually, through unknown means, the Sealers lived up to their name, and sealed the Old God in a “large prison made of Earth,” which was launched into the sky, cursing the old God to orbit the planet he cannot control forever. 


The Sealers brought forth a new God, a more merciful being that genuinely loved humanity. This is why the God in the New Testament seems so much kinder than the God in the Old Testament, because they’re two completely different beings. The Old God ruled with fire and obedience, the New God offered with forgiveness and mercy.


The Sealers also claimed that this isn’t a permanent solution, they’d been communicating with the New God to prepare for the inevitable battle between the two, which will determine the future of humanity. If the Old God wins, we return to a world of punishment and fear. If the New God wins, life continues as normal, as we’ve come to expect, not fair, but much more merciful. 


Even the Sealers do not know how much time we have. Researchers on the moon had noticed massive spikes in radiation, to the point where a few had become sick. 


We lost contact with them three days ago. 


I’m sitting around a campfire, waiting with the Sealers. We watch the moon open up, a giant hand of darkness and fire emerging from inside it. 


The Old God is back for us, and all humanity can do is pray. "

‘Never!’ I repeated, and it was true.

Never, never, never.

Horace is coming to house-sit today.

He’s a local ‘friend’ of Joy, but he’s no friend of mine.

I don’t trust him.

He reminds me of greasy suede.

He mutters obscenities when Joy’s not listening, and stares at her treasured gold ornaments. Family heirlooms.

He covets them.

I watch him.

Joy is, very surprisingly, quite a wealthy woman. Not many people know it.

But Horace knows it.

He arrives at midday. 

‘Say hello to Horace!’ Joy smiles.

We regard each other.

‘Horace.’

‘Daisy.’ He tips his hat to me, and Joy laughs.

‘Be good, Daisy,’ she grins. ‘Let me know if he says anything, won’t you!”

‘Be good,’ I reply back.

With a cheerful wave, and a clink of keys in the hallway, she’s off.

Four uneventful hours have passed - each ignoring the other - but we both know Joy is due back soon.

The warm Texas sun is setting. Peculiar shadows skitter outside.

Horace looks at me. 

‘I’m Joy’s only real friend, Daisy,’ he whispers nastily.  His eyes, much like his teeth, are yellow and ancient. ‘I’m the only one in her will. Jealous?’

‘Jealous?’ I enquire.

‘That’s right, you are.’

He kneels in front of me. ‘But, you know, she’s an old woman now. An old, senile woman, who has a lot - shall we say - a lot to offer.’

He sweeps his gaze gleefully around the room.

‘An I’m not a patient man, Daisy.’ His voice hardens. ‘I get sick of waiting.’

My heart starts thrumming, but I bite my tongue.

‘Times are tight, so to speak,’ he continues, ‘and that inheritance money - well, that’s about 20 thousand right there, what with them gold statues.

He looks at me.

'Joy never locks her doors at night.’

I know what he’s about to say.

*Say it,* I urged silently. *Say it out loud.*

He grins.

‘I’m going to murder Joy!’ He whispers. ‘I’m going to murder Joy, and who knows what the fuck will happen to you then! You’re sure as hell not living with me!’

*Murder. Joy. Murder. Joy.*

He stands up then, and ambles towards the door.

‘Oh. And one more thing.’

He turns back.

My blood freezes.

‘Sleep well tonight, Daisy,

Two hours later, the clock ticks on in the brassy silence, and I lie in wait.

I’ve been practicing.

‘Murder Joy!' I repeat to the empty sitting room. ‘Murder Joy! Murder Joy!'

Then, a light floods the porch outside. I hear her key in the lock.

I ruffle my feathers in a nervous flush, and strain on my perch.

I always talk to Joy when people have visited.

""I've finally found you,"" she whispered to him in between his short gasps for air. They were huddled together face to face in a small alleyway, surrounded by putrid decaying brick, horse manure and the monotonous sound of raindrops connecting with mud. 

She had searched the streets for this man over the course of several months, to no avail. After she had read the grisly details of his crimes in the paper, his disturbing post-coitus rambling had suddenly made sense. His knees crumbled as they both dropped to the sludge.

""Do you remember me? You bastard spawn of Satan,"" she whispered into his dying ear, lying on top of his shaking wet body. ""You once told me all about how much you liked to *gut,* things."" The knife still lodged in his stomach twisted, and he sucked in as much air as he could. The rain was washing out his insides which had begun to spill out. Somehow, that final breath would not leave him. 

He just stared at her, trying to recall her face... Then, she could see in his eyes that the memory of their nights together had returned to him. ""Whore,"" he coughed with blood and eyes wide as the night. 

""Oh yes, and I want you to look deep into these eyes, the eyes that you have seen go dark far too many times, and know that you will never hurt us again. Look deep, and show me fear."" The woman yanked the knife out of the man's stomach and with the brute force of a hammer, plunged it blindly into his face. Again. And again...

The piercing sound of a police whistle cut through the air like an icicle crashing into steel. ""Oy! What do ya think you're doin' there?!"" Two policemen came running toward the brutal scene of the woman still hammering. ""My, *God* in heaven... Don't you move!"" The taller, paler policeman pulled her off the man and wrestled the knife away. She was screaming and kicking with the black rain and soft moonlight echoing from her bloody nightgown.

""Let go of me you dense animals! That's Jack the fuckin' Ripper!"""
kn5zqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kn5zqs/calvin_and_the_cave/,Calvin and the Cave,1340,60,1609347736.0,"The sign was covered in algae, faded by time and saltwater, but the image was still clear. A grim reaper holding a scythe, one bony hand raised to warn off would-be divers. Behind the sign was a slim steel gate covering a hole the size of a kiddie pool. It was the only entrance to Violet Drop, a mass of underwater tunnels and caves resting like a tumor off Maryland’s eastern shore.

Calvin floated over to the gate. There was a lot of silt in the water; it danced slowly across the beam of his flashlight as he fixed it on the heavy padlock. His hand shook, but only a little, as he pressed the key into the hole and turned it. A recreational diver, Calvin’s OWD certification wasn’t enough to convince the dive shop to grant him access to Violet Drop. So he’d swiped the key while the cashier was distracted filling up tanks.

Calvin was dying and touching the bottom of Violet was the last item on his bucket list. He’d be damned if a lack of experience would prevent him from feeling that deep, cold water. With a quick kick of his fins, Calvin slipped into the cave entrance.

Any light from the surface was dead and buried within 20-feet down the tunnel. Calvin swam slowly, one hand sweeping his light back-and-forth, the other brushing against the porous rock of the cave wall. Violet Drop was 85-percent charted. Calvin wanted to go through that other 15-percent that was too deep and narrow to explore. Too risky for anyone but a dying man.

The passages became tighter as they curved down, a series of stone knots that Calvin navigated as best he could from the memory of a map. At several points, he had to peel off his oxygen tank and push it forward before squeezing through slim openings in the cave. Once he made it to the uncharted portion of Violet Drop, Calvin felt his mouth ache from the grin.

He wasn’t swimming anymore, the passages were too narrow. Calvin crawled and squirmed, fighting for every inch. Finally, he saw an opening. He was nearly at the bottom. Lunging forward, Calvin tried to extend his arm only to find his shoulders wedged. Panicking, Calvin tried to back up but couldn’t budge.

He was stuck.

Nearly an hour passed before Calvin saw the first crab. It was pale and appeared as soft as a marshmallow. The crustacean was nearly as big as a cat. Two uncomfortably human eyes extended from its shell on twitching stalks. Instead of claws, the creature had tiny hands with delicate fingers. It regarded Calvin curiously. Then the crab split nearly in half along a seam in its shell.

Calvin stared down into row after row of small, perfect, human teeth. The creature *hissed*. More hissing came from deeper in the tunnel. Then the *click click click* of hundreds of boney legs headed toward the trapped diver."

Ready?

*Four hundred metres.*

[Bump. Muffled: ""dead zone… no surveillance…""]

*Please state your name.*

[Truck slows]

Dr. Irving Haskell.

*You have approximately ten minutes, Dr. Haskell.*

About my compensation—

*As discussed. Ten million dollars and safe passage to Beijing in exchange for your knowledge.*

Where do I start?

*The beginning.*

It started in Peru in 2003.

*You were involved from the beginning?*

Yes, I'd been involved in the initial planning since the 1990s, and I took over as overseer in 2001.

*Why Peru?*

Lack of government interference. Away from Chinese spies.

*Why didn't it start earlier?*

The tech wasn't there. We lacked the ability.

*Ability to do what?*

Brain transplants.

*Tell me about the site in Peru.*

It was an orphanage joined to a hospital for the mentally deficient.

*Children?*

Partly.

*What did you hope to accomplish?*

We were afraid we were falling behind in science—in intelligence, and we hoped to close the gap by accelerating the education of a select few... superspecimen.

*Explain the process.*

It was based on the Russian doping programs and Chinese sports camps, but instead of isolating gifted children and specializing them in gymnastics, we wanted to specialize them in mathematics, physics, chemistry.

*You mentioned brain transplants.*

Yes, that was the breakthrough. Because even the most gifted mind takes time to learn. We invented a bypass. By extracting one child's brain and implanting it successively in what we called learners—

*Did the children die?*

The donors, yes. Unfortunately.

*What were the learners?*

People. Mental deficients whose heads we'd hollowed out and whose bodies we'd re-engineered into biological learning machines. One for each subject, and the donor brains completed the cycle, transplanted into each learner in turn.

[Sigh]

I'll never forget the learning chamber, those docile bodies sitting and learning the same thing over and over. Barely resting, barely eating...

*Then?*

The brains were rehomed.

*Into superspecimen?*

Yes, children the same age as those from whom we'd harvested the brains. You can appreciate the elegance. Learning untangled from time. Education in the blink of an eye.

*Did it work?*

Oh, yes.

*How did you choose between donors and superspecimen?*

At random.

*But one died and the other survived.*

That's a matter of perspective. The donor's body died, but its brain actually thrived in the superspeciman's body.

*Did you know their names?*

Always.

[Truck engine cuts]

What's the—

*Mateo Garcia. Angel Rodriguez. Hugo Echeveria. Alvaro Fonseca. Pablo Jimenez.*

[Breathing]

*Javier Lopez. Manuel Perez. Rodrigo Morales. I can go on.*

Those were all learners.

[Breathing]

Who… are you?

*I am all of them. Or they are me.*

Impossible.

*I didn't just learn the foundations of science, Dr. Haskell. I learned my-selves. I became twenty-seven of them. Imagine what it feels like to be twenty-seven people's desire for revenge.*

You're mad. The learners were eliminated when the program was shut down—

*It was never shut down.*

In 2017.

*You were removed as overseer.*

I...

*Until next time, Doctor.*

Santa has come and gone. He's eaten all the cookies and drank all the milk. He's almost completely dead from a sugar overload. We've fought in the trenches of the electronic aisle, we've spilled blood in the children's section, and we've racked up credit card bills so high, the numbers get fuzzy after a while, and you cannot quite understand them for some reason. 

We've reached the end of 2020 and unfortunately, the world doesn't reset. The start of 2021 is going to continue to be miserable, but we've got renewed hope that shit will un-hit the fan soon.

He figures he must have been drinking last night because his head was pounding so hard, he could almost hear it. He gets out of the bottom bunk of a bunkbed, dragging his feet toward the bathroom to his left. He trips over something and while turning to see what is was, he sees his wife in the corner to the right.

are you crying? mark asks his wife. she does not answer.  He walks toward her, asking if she was alright. she does answer and mark becomes suddenly enraged at her silence and yells,

 why arent you answering me? 

his wife turns, the sight of her makes him wince for some reason, his wife says

you know why im not answering you!

no i dont, mark replies.

im mad at what you did, the wife says, and i dont want to talk to you.

what did I do? the pounding grows louder, omg what did i drink last night?

he starts to back up but his wife grabs him by the face, then says,

its not the drink baby, dont back up.

why not? and what is it? mark questions.

His wife answers, because you cant take it.

cant take what?

she kisses him, then says goodbye, and walks to the door.

mark yells, where you going , you leaving me?

she touches the door knob and the door flies open as police rush in, holding mark at gun point, he no longer sees his wife.

Mark screams, what are you doing in here, and what did yall do with my wife, babe?

mark calls but gets no answer, the cops look at him in a very peculiar way and mark begins to feel uneasy. He backs up, studdering, 

wh-wh-why yall in here man? he takes one final step backwards and falls over.

He screams, realizing what he tripped over was the body of his wife. The police, at a lost for words puts handscuffs around marks wrists as he still screams

Their daughter had been missing for some time. From what I gather there had been an accident and they hadn’t been able to reach her since. I hated seeing them like this so I knew I had to be the one to track her down. After they left I told Margaret my assistant about the case. She seemed encouraging then she went to get me a fruit cup, she likes to take care of me.


Oct 19- Not many leads on the case, the missing girl didn’t seem to have any enemies or any reason to leave. I’ve looked through her social media and everyone is just wishing her well. One girl stood out to me; Amanda. I’ve asked her to come see me.


Oct 21- Amanda has paid me a visit, she seemed awkward but probably anxious to see her friend again. No new information to report, Amanda is not a suspect. Everything seems to lead to a dead end.


Oct 24- The girl could not have gone missing on her own. Her car was destroyed during the accident. She had no known friends or family out of the area. Her accounts haven’t been touched. Her sister spent the day telling me all about the girl’s history.


Oct 28- The Robinsons come every couple of days looking for an update, I didn’t want to disappoint them but they seem happy to hear what I had to say. They only had good things to say about Amanda.


Oct 29- I fear the case may be in jeopardy. I may have gotten too close to the truth. Every time I want to go to investigate something Margaret will give me an excuse why I can’t. She is either protecting me or trying to stop me finding out what happened to the girl. Maybe she’s involved? She is always writing something in that notebook of hers.


Oct 30- This case is causing me a lot of stress, Margaret has been giving me medication for headaches. What if she’s drugging me? I need to get to the bottom of this.


Nov 5- It’s been few days. Margaret has kept her distance she can tell I’m suspicious, she’ll only come in to give me my meals.


Nov 10- I have found a clue to crack this case wide open. While Margaret was distracted I had a chance to sneak her notebook. I couldn’t believe what I was reading. She knows a lot more than she’s letting on. In her notes she has written about the missing girl a lot. She must know where she is and I’m going to make her show me. This poor girl. Margaret has written that she has become ‘paranoid’ and ‘delusional’ and that she has recommends a higher dose of medication."

It seems like forever, like this place *spawned* me, and yet... didn’t I had a life before too? Yes... I... was... I can’t remember.
 
Does it even matter anymore? I’m here now, in this... place.
 
What is this place? It’s dark, and cold... how did I get here? I was... exploring... yeah, that’s the word. I (Was? Am?) a curious person... I think. I think I had... a fundamental interest in the world... and a *need* for... what was it... adventure.
 
I don’t think I had very many friends, but those I did, I think they shared my curiosity... Yes, we would go on *adventures* together, not that they were really adventures, we hardly ever found anything interesting in the places we explored. Not until that last time anyway... when was that? That was the time we found *it*
 
What was it? It’s been so hard to remember things lately... like I’m changing somehow... What am I becoming? What was I before?
 
I think it was tall, it was certainly unnatural, emaciated. Its features, I think they were... twisted somehow, asymmetrical, not enough to immediately understand what was wrong, just enough to register that *something* was.
 
The story is coming back to me as I think about it, it’s foggy but I think I remember enough to tell it now.
 
It made a noise unlike anything I’ve ever heard, almost like... singing, but with no recognizable melody. The sound was slow, unnatural, almost like multiple voices of wildly varying ages all “singing” at the same time. It didn’t charge us, or attack us at all. In fact, it was... sitting, with its legs pulled up to its chest and its elbows and forearms resting on the ground, and its palms facing up, just... staring longingly at the night sky. We tried to stand still and not make any noise, but somehow it knew we were there. And it turned and *looked* at us... and... then I was here. In the darkness, with no idea how I got here, or... who I am?
 
My memories are fading again, I can feel myself slipping away...
 
How long have I been here?"

I didn't think much about it much, just thought the pigs were all having a brawl with each other.

&#x200B;

The next day, me and my uncle headed down to the house to fetch some equipment we needed to visit my late dying grandmother.

When we got there and pried open both doors, the smell hit the both of us first as we made our way through the pins. There lying on the hay and mud filled ground was our eleven boars, gutted, mutilated, and dismembered. Their intestines were all wrapped around the poles that hold the upper top area, like some gruesome decorations. 

And when we got through the piles of the bodies, a single note covered in crimson, red liquid, was on the floor, I picked it up and it said,

&#x200B;

""Thanks for the late night buffet, I may come back again someday, I'm coming for you next Daniel""

That was the name of my uncle, who was reading over my shoulder and soon moved out a week later."

It's a very relaxing place to be, I don't usually have to worry about interacting with anyone but my dog. Now my dog ,Rufus, was laying on the floor, asleep. When all the sudden we heard,

*knock knock knock*

""Who could be knocking at the door at this time of night?"" ,I said to Rufus as I got up out of my old rocking chair. I opened the door and, to my surprise, no one was there. I looked to the right and to the left, but there was no one in sight. I closed the door, and not even 10 seconds later,

*knock knock knock*

I open the door again, this time with more haste, but once again, no one in sight. I closed the door angrily and was walking to my rocking chair when I heard,

*knock knock knock*

At this point I had just about enough of this, so I grabbed my 12 gauge double barrel shotgun, and loaded it with ammo. I opened the door and ,of course, no one was there. I shut the door again, and just as I turned around, I saw it, it was 7 feet tall, it had big claws, and its eyes were as dark as night. It took me a moment to realize, but it was eating my dog, Rufus. I had to think quick, I cocked my 12 gauge shotgun and fired two rounds into that Godforsaken beast.

*thump*

It fell over on its side, and died. Whatever that thing was, it killed my dog. And now everytime I hear a knock at my door, I can't help but think twice about opening it."

kmurdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmurdj/frost_bites/,Frost Bites,67,11,1609301755.0,"Fruit flies are so fond of ketchup that they lay their eggs in it. But the United States Food and Drug Administration enforces strict limits. Quality assurance researchers must guarantee that, per 100 grams of condiment, there are no more than 15 fruit fly eggs and no more than one fruit fly maggot.

If you thought that was gross, wait for what comes next. 

In 2020, General Mills (or “Big G” as it’s called in the Great Lakes Region) avoided catastrophe. The *”multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods”* calls Minneapolis home, the same city where my dingy newspaper is based. My intrepid investigative reporters almost exposed the truth.

Big G makes lots of things, including various cereals we’ve all heard of: *Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Count Chocula*, and much more. They also briefly made a cereal called *Frost Bites,* advertised as “icicle-shaped, corn-based, blueberry frosted clusters.” But *Frost Bites* were pulled from stores the night before their nation-wide unveiling, helping Big G avert a crisis that would have made all previous genetically modified food controversies look rosy by comparison.

John Ford Bell, great-grandson of Big G’s founder, dreamed up *Frost Bites* as a winter 2020 surprise. The new brand was positioned as a marketing blitz to kick-start the company’s transition into 2021. But a special ingredient was discovered after a million boxes of the stuff were already manufactured. In early 2020, John Ford Bell’s wife and five children were “stranded in a snowstorm” and “died of natural causes” at their vacation home in southern Ontario. Big G covered up the fact that Bell, a manic depressive, murdered them. 

The secret ingredient in Frost Bites, according to since-silenced whistleblowers, was Bell’s family’s cremains. Bell was unavailable for comment thanks to blowing off his head in his corner office at Big G headquarters in early December. Sweeping everything under the rug was as easy as the conglomerate tapping into a fraction of their $15 billion annual revenue to shut us up. 

Whether you believe this or write me off as a conspiracy theorist is your choice. But consider this the next time you take a bite of cereal: past the smiling bumblebees, bubbly leprechauns, and ripoff universal monsters are dark, well-disguised truths. 

Was that bite you just ate particularly *mealy*? Did that burnt cereal kernel taste funny, perhaps a bit like chemicals? Are the wheaten dregs amidst the leftover milk you just slurped down giving you a good old-fashioned case of funny tummy?

It’s a real “bay leaf in the spaghetti sauce”-type situation. A “Charlie and the Golden Ticket”-sort of deal. The chances are one in a million that you’re eating an actual fruit fly maggot or the remains of a murdered child. 

But don’t say I didn’t warn you about the possibility. As the adage goes, “you are what you eat.”"
kmtk55,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmtk55/envy/,Envy,34,2,1609297425.0,"Envy - such a fickle emotion, don't you agree? Born out of want, and fuelled by hatred. Many have succumbed to it, going from calm, rational people to primal savages. They scheme and plot, hoping for a taste of the better life that lies just out of reach.

Not everyone fails, though. Sure, the majority of the population lack the means to achieve their goals. But every now and then, there comes one who has not only the motivation, but also the intelligence to pull off such a feat.

I envy you, you know. And bad things happen to people I envy.

I remember the first time that it happened. I was young and sloppy back then, and my methods were far from foolproof. But in that moment, standing above the dismembered corpse of my enemy, I finally understood it all; the world was unfair, and not everyone got what they wanted.

So I began my journey. Searching for the rich and the powerful, taking what I wanted and killing those who got in my way. I can remember every kill; the terrified screams, the splatter of blood, the way their eyes stared lifeless as I crushed their heart in my hands.

You might wonder why I envy you. You are neither rich, powerful or famous. But I have enough of that, and you have what I desire. You see, in my travels I realised; what use was money, without others to share it with? What use was fame, without others to bear witness to my glory?

So I watched, and I waited. Patiently biding my time, keeping watch for the one whom I would deem fit to take with me. It was dreary task, but in the end, it was all worth it. Because amidst the crowds of dim-witted fools, I found you.

You're not perfect, of course, but then again nobody is. Your pesky morals and avoidance of blood is - sub-optimal, at best. You're an adaptive person though, and I'm sure that a few kills of your own should fix most of those irritating problems.

So you see? There's nothing to worry about. All you have to do, is come with me! 

Sit tight; I'll be there soon."
kmt0x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/kmt0x0/balancing_act/,Balancing Act,67,5,1609295536.0,"Avoid the circus, they kept telling me. The circus is off limits to visitors.

*“Off limits”, seriously?* Whenever I pressed them for explanations, they’d say, their eyes wandering, that they were really fond of their old circus and would hate to see it closed down due to “structural unsafety”, “unethical animal practices” or whatever other *un*\-problem government pricks liked to close places down for nowadays.

Their instincts were right; I was no ordinary visitor. For two months prior, their town hall had been placing an oddball assortment of orders for materials, equipment, and heavily NDA’d software jobs. Some were with former army contractors, which got my higher-ups all excited. Privately, I had them pegged as bumbling public-construction enthusiasts. *A baby-sized tower of Babel.* Or else it was a convoluted embezzlement scheme. Something for other government pricks to worry about. Not us.

The circus itself stood in the middle of a strangely deserted square. Every now and then I’d hear a muffled fanfare, though; and people looking like legitimate circus performers were going in and out.

I had no trouble planting a night-vision camera nearby. *Gotcha.* The clowns and acrobats kept filtering in and out at night. And now they were joined by people wearing gas masks.

We were a step ahead of them. The gas-mask order was what had alerted us in the first place. I’d brought my own.

At the entrance, I named one of the software firms they’d contracted. They sprayed me all over with something before letting me in. Backstage, gas-masked people with laptops were doing something to animatronic lions and horses. *Incredibly lifelike.* I wandered off and saw that the show was still on at that hour.

Two clowns were growling unintelligibly at each other, occasionally breaking into hollow, mechanical guffaws. The laughter and claps from the audience sounded uninspired. Finally the clowns ambled away with an unnatural, stilted gait.

A fanfare sounded, the lighting changed, and a tightrope walker appeared overhead. I thought at first that she was a robot too. The same stilted movements. It would take some insane skill to zombie-walk a tightrope.

I went up to the lighting booth. I named my real, three-letter employer and demanded to know what was going on. I removed my gas mask and nearly puked from the smell coming off my own clothes.

The gray-haired lighting guy briefly ran a spotlight across the seats.

The decomposing faces have been haunting me ever since. Especially the kids. *An* un-*problem indeed. As in “undead”.*

“Ma’am, you don’t want to act alive, or smell alive, in front of that audience. Or you’ll end up among them. You see, everyone in town loves our circus—even after death, apparently.

Yes, that is terrible. Thank you for your condolences. Ever since, I made a sacred vow to rid the world of every single one of you thankless, violent leeches I come across.

That's what you all say, but you're all the same.

We were nearby, about 20 minutes away but me and my younger sister were hungry, so we stopped at a McDonald's on the way. We would have gone through the drive thru but it was closed so we had to go inside to order.

The McDonald's was emptier than I'd ever seen one. It was about an hour to midnight so my mum ordered it to go. While she was ordering I noticed an old man. He must have been 50 or 60, he was gray with an unkempt beard. But at that age, the thing that struck me the most odd was that he was alone on new years eve, and I remember thinking how sad it was and how much I would have hated having that happen to me.

At the time I didn't notice but he looked like an older version of my young self. 

But I never thought much about it until now. It only now dawned on me that I'm sitting in an empty McDonald's alone on new years eve in my late 50's, with gray hair and an unkempt beard. 

Then I saw a young boy walk in with his mother and his sister... I saw him looking at me and I thought that he looked like I did when I was younger... I wonder if he will end up like me..."

A bell on the door jingles as I enter Madame Gloria’s Cauldron, the hole-in-the-wall trinket store I’d been searching for. In keeping with the shop’s mystical theme is its shopkeeper, a beautiful woman draped in a colourful shawl and dark lipstick who bustles out to assist me.

“Holiday’s blessings” smiles the raven-haired lady. “What brings you to my store today, dear?”

“Well, word on the street is you sell jinxed knickknacks here” I answer mischievously, glancing around at the strange artefacts and ingredients. “You know—crystal balls that give scary visions, bath salts that dissolve skin, mints that fuse your mouth together—the *real deal*.”

Madame Gloria’s eyes furrow in a cross between scorn and bewilderment.

“You’ve been told...correctly,” she replies with an air of caution. “But I must impress upon you that hexes are very serious—what has the recipient done to warrant such punishment?”

At this I give a small laugh, waving the scrap of paper with his name on it.

“Nothing! Arthur’s just the biggest wuss in my friend group. Dude is scared of *everything*. When besides KK am I gonna get the opportunity to prank him anonymously and be the centre of attention? Now, can you help me or not?”

For the next hour, Madame Gloria begrudgingly sorts through the menagerie of items until, eventually, I settle on one perfect for scaring Arthur.

“Thank you for your patronage” she breezes, placing the gift-wrapped box in my hands. “May you get *just* the reaction you seek.”

I can barely contain my anticipation when the day of my social circle’s gift exchange rolls around. Sarah gets a radio from Tom, Tom gets a sweater from Arthur...and Arthur will get, from me, an Aztec statue that comes to life in his hands. It’ll fit with his collection of action figures—if it doesn’t stab him first.

By the time I receive my own present, I don’t even care what crap I’m getting. I just want to hurry apart the parcel in my lap so Arthur can open his. While I tear off wrapping paper, I notice Arthur moving to greet someone at the patio door.

“Sorry to interrupt, everyone!” his bespectacled face announces. “My new girlfriend just got here!”

Plucking off the box’s ribbon, I listen absentmindedly as he continues.

“Even though we’ve only been going out for weeks, she *insisted* on doing Kris Kringle with us this year. Gloria even had me put her present in the pile this morning…”

Across the deck appears Madame Gloria, having arrived just in time to watch her Kris Kringle receive her gift. Only as the lid falls from my hands does realisation hit.

I nary have time to scream before an eruption of fireworks goes off right in my face."

I do not have any kind of powers at all but I have been accused of mental verbal abuse anyway. It started off with a little boy accusing me and saying that I have been saying horrible things to him with my so called mind powers. Everyone started to threaten me. I kept telling people that I don’t have any kind of mind powers but none of them seem to believe me. Everyday the little boy would make up more things of supposed things I have said to him through my mind. Horrid things in which I would never say at all.  


Then a little girl went to the authorities and told everyone that through my mind I was sending her horrid images to her mind. She went on to say that I was giving her nightmares at night and the things she drew on paper which she says were images I had sent her through my mind. I have no idea what to do and I don’t know how to prove that I don’t have mind powers of any kind.  


 The whole village was against me and I started getting threats from people of how they were going to chop off my head or throw me into the cage with some wild animal. Then a couple came forward and even though they were both adults, they too started telling everyone that I was saying horrible things to them through my mind powers and sending them decrepit images to their mind. Now it was even more colossal because it wasn’t just children accusing me but two grown adults.  


 I was lost and the idea of being hurt or punished for something I didn’t do was to horrific for me and unfair. I mean if I had done something actually horrible then I wouldn’t mind being punished or being sent to prison, because then I would actually deserve it. So I went up to the little boy, the little girl and the couple. I murdered all of them and mutilated their bodies and took pictures of it all and posted all over the village.  


 I am going to prison for it and most likely I am going to get murdered in prison but at least I deserve it, see I don’t mind it when I actually deserve it.  So to anyone on Thier death beds you now all know that I am telling the truth that I am not sending you horrid images or thoughts with my mind powers because I have no mind powers"

Then I panicked, even though I had gotten rid of the corpse, someone knew ... I hurriedly gave the answer sheet to my teacher and left the school. 

I looked around, on the stone sidewalk people were walking around but I managed to see the stranger, he was in a white building next to my school and he was hiding behind a tree, I could not see his face but I could see that he was wearing a black coat and he was holding a red umbrella even though it was not raining, it was the umbrella of the child I had hit !. I went towards him but the stranger had now disappeared.I felt that someone was watching me, I understood the presence of the stranger and finally the day I was waiting for came. As I closed my eyes to sleep I saw the stranger fleeing with the red umbrella entering my room and coming closer and closer to me ..."

I think that the boredom of the womb must have really gotten to me. As a child, my parents read all the same stories to me as the other parents to their children, but I never grew out of them. I couldn’t look at a gingerbread house without being envious of Gretel’s adventure. “So many people are trapped,” I thought, “that I must be able to save someone.” My ambitions softened in high school, especially as I learned the recent history of the lands of Perrault and Grimm.

I set my sights on something more scientific, cryptozoology. “The forest is so big,” I thought, “that there must be sasquatch somewhere.” I wasn’t just going to take blurry pictures or shaky videos. I was going to befriend a whole tribe of them. I’d teach them sign language like Koko and interview them for a documentary. I’d go on “Letterman” to promote the film, look into the camera, and tell all the kids who had stayed up past their bedtimes not to give up on their dreams. The world was my oyster, and then, within what felt like hours of graduation, the flesh was rotten, ants had carried the pearl away, and I was forty years old alone in the woods with a bigfoot whistle in my mouth and low tide in my nostrils.

Ghosts were next. Everybody knows someone with a ghost story. The great thing about ghosts is that people say that anything can be haunted. Buildings, rooms, cemeteries, roads, dolls, ships, and websites have all been declared haunted. “So many organisms have died on the earth,” I thought, “that there must be spirits somewhere.” I came closer to being arrested for trespassing that to seeing a ghost.

I was certain that I could tip the odds in my favor. Many cultures believe that the veil between the living and the dead thins at certain times and dates, but I found that the opacity was always total. If I wanted a peek, I was going to have to rip the cloth. My interests had always been adjacent to the occult, and I had befriended a few practitioners, but I was never desperate enough until I retired. I begged hell for a sign. I couldn’t die so unaccomplished.

When the sacrifices failed and my body withered, I wrote an autobiography, “Explorers on Mapped Terrain,” to warn others not to waste their lives. It sold well. Letterman had retired by then, but I advised any children watching my interviews on the other late-night shows to get STEM jobs and start families.

On my death bed, a doctor who was pioneering new techniques in cryonics came to me. I signed my body away on the condition that I wouldn’t be unfrozen before aliens had made first contact. I expected a dreamless sleep, but there’s something else in my icy nightmare. “Your soul is so big,” said the demon, “that I’ll never get bored.”"

The tie is now reaching towards you, like the palm of an unwelcome stranger extending their gnarled fingers out for a handshake. Dread creeps up from within as you now try to run, and trip over your own feet. 

And it lurches. Somehow boring its way through your flesh and winding its way around the tenuous bones of your ribcage. You hear snapping and a bile-churning crunch as your chest tightens to unbearable level. Trying to scream wouldn’t help, because even if you could, who would hear you? Who would even understand how to help? They’d just sit and scream with you or worse, they’d run themselves. 

Suddenly, and not nearly quickly enough all at the same time-it stops tightening. You lie in silence as seconds, a minute, five go by and steady your breathing. Stumbling to your feet, you pull desperately at your chest and panic once again upon the realization that it would be impossible to remove the tie without nearly killing yourself. 

And you resolve to live with it. But every now and then, the feeling creeps back again, tightening your tie and stealing away your air. So you lie in the dark, you punch the walls, you try to cut it out of you. Just try to remember that it will never truly go away, just ease its grip on you from time to time."

It was at the start of the year, on a path down the street. By the time I returned to the beginning of the path, it was nearly dusk, but I didn’t wanna go home yet. I wanted to see more.

Feeling adventurous, I made the decision to go off the path. There was a clearing nearby, and with the most recent snowfall having left a small blanket of white that looked entirely undisturbed, it was too tempting not to check out.

After crossing the wide space, which had a slight incline as it neared a hill up ahead, I spotted something odd. Between two huge rocks, obscured by foliage, was what looked like a hole. Pushing some of the brittle vines aside, I uncovered what, upon closer inspection, seemed to be a man-made tunnel. I took a few steps inside, kicking rocks and sticks aside, while holding my hands out. Realizing that the tunnel was longer than I thought, I turned my phone light on and continued.

The tunnel was long, and wide enough that I could walk through it easily. Up ahead, I saw what looked like doorways along sides of the tunnel. As I approached the first door, I found a flat wooden surface. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, so I started recording from my phone. “So I’m in this tunnel I found,” I whispered to myself, “and I have no idea what’s in here. I think there’s something on the other side of this, so I’m going to try to push it open.”

I tried to push against the wood, but it didn’t budge much. I stepped back and ran into it, shoulder first, and it gave way a little bit. “There’s definitely something here,” I said before slamming against the wood again.

A small space appeared at one end, like the wood was part of a door that had slightly opened. I looked inside, and could only see the glow of some kind of light. “I see a light,” I said, and from the other side of the door, someone screamed bloody murder.

Nearly dropping my phone in surprise, I ended the recording and ran out of the tunnel, pointing my phone’s light ahead of me. As I neared the entrance, I tripped on something. It felt like more rocks and sticks, but when I looked back, it was a skeleton. Near the skull, there was a small glint of metal. I grabbed it before running back to the trail.

I still have the pin I found, a metal lapel pin in the shape of a black rose. I found myself staring out at the snow today, holding the pin, wondering if I should bring it back to its owner- and more importantly, what’s waiting behind the doors, and where the man-made tunnel ends."

Nothing weird happened for a few days. Then I woke up with ""body_control.sight_input(restriction = ""living"").resting_bpm = 100"" under my neck.

On a whim, I videocalled my friend Matt who knew programming.

""Is this a tattoo?"" he asked.

""No! It appeared on my body this morning.""

He squinted at the words. ""Given the function names, I'd assume it takes the living things you see as input, and then makes their resting heart rate 100 bpm.""

""But you're the first person I saw!""

""Well, I think I'd notice if my heart rate was that high, so at least you know it doesn't work."" He smiled. ""But on the other hand, you'd need to run the code for it to work - ""

Something surged through my body and Matt gasped, putting his hand to his heart. He hung up and that evening, he called back to say he was taking drugs to lower his heart rate.

""Don't worry,"" he replied to my apology. ""I think I'll be fine.""

The next day, the text was replaced by ""body_control.hearing_input(restriction = ""living"").contract()"". I e-mailed Matt about the text, and he replied, *I guess you should try not to hear anybody.*

*Sure,* I replied. As I sent the e-mail, the surge hit me again, and I nervously paced around.

""Calm down,"" I told myself before a sharp pain ran through me. I instinctively looked down and saw ""AttributeError: 'body' object has no attribute 'contract'"" on my stomach in red text.

I called Matt and said, ""I don't think it's working anymore. It sent out an error!"" When he didn't respond, I asked, ""Is something wrong?""

Energy ran through me, and when his dog barked in the background, whining rapidly followed. Matt shouted and then screamed.

I looked down, and to my horror, the error message was gone and the line was now ""body_control.hearing_input(restriction = ""living"").*stomach*.contract()"".

He and the dog could no longer digest food due to their permanently-contracted stomachs, and I heard they died after a few days. I isolated myself (easy to do in these times) so now whenever the code runs, it can only affect me. I've vomited and shat myself countless times since, but it seems whoever makes the code cares about my well-being enough to keep me alive.

I've learned more about computer science so I don't end up killing again, but I can't seem to change the text written on me. I can write over it, but every time the code runs, those markings disappear. I've also tried removing the code by cutting it out of my skin, but it extends into the muscle beneath.

I see no option besides beheading myself, so I can't take in information anymore and the lack of an import statement renders the code useless."

A little bit of hair growing in that sunken part off the bridge of my nose, in between my eyes.

But it got big. It started getting stuck in my vision as it collapsed onto my eye, and getting sniffled up into my nostril, even falling down into my mouth at times. I'd wake up some nights, feeling it inside my nose, as it snuck down onto the back of my tongue.

Sometimes, and I couldn't tell if it was the tickle of the hair or not, I could start to feel an odd bumping sensation around the part where it grew out.

I tried tugging at it, but that hurt too much to bother with, and when I did, the bumping sensation would increase by tenfold, like I had agitated it.

It got much worse. The bumps became scratches under my skin, like something was trying to claw it's way out. I even felt it behind my eyes and on the top of my throat. The hair, at this point, started to dangle past my chin, and even reached my collarbone when I hung my head slightly. I'd end up gasping for air when it found my throat, triggering my gag reflex.

Enough was enough. Fuck the pain. I'm ripping this out.

I grabbed it with both hands and pulled. It hurt, god did it hurt, but I was determined. Whatever the *hell* was inside of me was coming out.

Blood started to pour from where the hair began, drenching the thing as more of it came out.

The scratching became more erratic and frantic, as rips started to form in my cheek, with more of the hairs peeking through them. A screeching sound emerged from my own mouth, but I couldn't tell if it was the thing or me making them.

And then the wound bloated as it's body started to collide against my skin. But I pulled
 And pulled. And pulled.

With a sharp crackle, it popped out. Long and gangly, a spider of 100 legs, it creeped around my hand as I held it, desperately trying to claw it's way back in with wails. As blood ran down my face and onto my chest, I rushed into the bathroom, and rinsed it down the drain in the shower.

1 hospital trip later I had scars upon scars on my face. The thing had ended up tearing my entire cheek out and a skin graft was needed. But it was done. No more creatures.

I headed home, glad that that was done, and started to change into my pyjamas.

But I noticed something. A hair, not unlike the one on my nose...

Had started to show on my chest."

I got to the bottom and headed for the electricity box. Then it started. A loud clanging sound echoed around my head, getting louder with every step. It was deafening, inescapable. Fuck this.

I turned around and made my way back to the stairs. That’s when i stopped hearing the clanging sounds, but instead, a light whisper.

I took one step up the stairs and again, it got louder, but this time it was behind me. I turned to see if i could see the source of the sound, but there was nothing. From this point on i continued to walk up the stairs backwards.

On the last few steps it turned to screams, cries of pain, except for the last step.

It all stopped. The whispers and the screams. It was replaced with something worse. Breath brushed the back of my neck. It was already at the top, waiting for me. It was already too late."
klzvm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klzvm1/pies/,Pies,74,2,1609192198.0,"I clean my hands as I hallucinate a disgustingly yellow painting of a smiling sun projected onto the tabletop. I shake it off, and since it's already floured, I start working on the dough. Shaping it had always been my favorite part of making the pies, ever since I was a young girl; my mind briefly goes to my mom and I, standing in the kitchen, making pies together. I repeat her movements, both in my memory and now, throwing the dough around the table, although more out of muscle memory from all the years I've done this. 

It's hot. Makes sense, since the oven is preheating right in front of me. But a hot climate has always given me allergies, so not really a personal favorite. We only make the pies when it's hot, too. Whatever, the shaped dough rolls out of my hands and to the sides, and I focus on finding the meat. 

My nose itches as I reach for the fridge. It reminds me of how Dylan used to scratch his nose all the time back when he was sick. Everytime I make pies I think of him. When I asked my mom, she said he had the flu, but that the elders would take care of him. I prayed for him a lot back then. 

No meat on the fridge. I sigh. The yellow sun from earlier is back and it seems to be taunting me. Might as well shape the dough a bit more before getting the meat. 

I remember the first time my mother taught me how to make pies and told me how important they were to us. They sold well, sure, when the men would go to the few dirt roads we had near our isolated community to sell them to hungry travelers, but that wasn't their main goal. 

I leave the soon to be pies stacked neatly and head to the room next to the kitchen. There's no inscriptions on the door indicating where it would lead to; only a yellow sun. The same sun I saw when my mom took me here years ago.

I open the door to the morgue. 

The smell takes me back instantly to when I was first here. I was crying. Asking why we had to do this. My mom hugged me and told me that was our only way of containing the flu. If we didn't do this, it would ravage us entirely. 

I grab the nearest body, and his face reminds me of Dylan's that day: disgustingly yellow, in a contorted, painful smile.

I head back to finish the pies."

klwvtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klwvtc/religion_isnt_a_cult/,Religion Isn’t a Cult,56,2,1609182976.0,"Hello there! Let me be the first to say, we are so glad you have joined us! It takes a lot of courage to come to a new group for the first time. Despite what you may have heard, religion isn’t a cult! It’s a group of like minded people celebrating the life He lent us! Please follow these rules so that you remain safe on our campus.

1. Be here by 6pm every Wednesday night. If the youth pastor catches you coming in late, he will make you sit in the storage room the entire service. We aren’t sure what it is about this room, but people usually seem different after they come out. 

2. We take communion at the start of service each week. Most congregations use grape juice as a symbol of the blood. Here, we take a volunteer and drink from them directly. Do not be afraid. It is a great honor in His eyes. 

3. Never take His name in vain lest your tongue be cut from your head. You don’t want to become part of our collection.

4. Baptism is only offered on the third Sunday of each month. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar. If you believe them, you will stay in the waters of baptism forever. 

5. If you find yourself on the second floor at any point during the service, stay away from room 112. There was a fire there many years ago during Sunday school, and the children who are still there are dying to make new friends. 

6. One thing we learn is that, “The dark does not like the light because it exposes their evil deeds.” Therefore, never enter a darkened room. Your presence will bring great offense to entities there. 

7. You will be asked to stay after the service and help clean up from the night’s festivities. During this, you will be alone much of the time. Be sure to turn on lights in each room before you enter, and announce your presence no matter how silly it feels. No room is ever empty. 

8. When you are alone in the church, you may get the feeling someone or something is following you. Do not panic unless you hear footsteps. If you hear them, run to the nearest room, and shut the door. You won’t have time to turn on the lights and announce your presence. However, it will be much worse for you if the thing that’s following you catches you.  

9. The youth pastor loves to make his sermons come to life, so he often likes to use volunteers as actors in his stories. Be sure to not volunteer when he is talking about the crucifixion of Christ. 

10. There is a woman named Lilith who wanders the 1st floor, and she will appear as a helpless old woman. Do not approach her under any circumstances. Take extra precaution if you are a female. Lilith was the first woman, and she despises competition."
klvb3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klvb3z/my_plan/,My Plan,27,3,1609178243.0,"So, I have a bit of a problem. A business problem. I inherited the business from my father, who inherited it from his parents. Well, my older sister inherited first, but she died...and nearly destroyed our home. I don't want to talk about it. I've run the business well for a while, but it's very big for one being to run. And the workforce is dwindling. I just can't force my employees not to leave. I've tried to pick up the slack where and when I can, but I'm only one being. The workforce problem is especially bad when combined with my other problem.

Hell is asses and elbows. There's tons and tons of people down here. There is **a death every 10 seconds!** You can literally go to hell for liking your reflection too much! I love torturing the wicked, but the workload is overwhelming me, and more importantly, my employees. So I've started letting more people than I probably should go to Purgatory. Mostly people with unaddressed disabilities and other medical issues that drove them to violence. Though they're definitely in there a while, they'll get to Heaven eventually, and immediately stop being my problem. But I have a plan to better lessen the workload.

Make them the human's problem.

I'll start with ten or fifteen Wicked Souls, and send out a few trusted demons to watch them from a distance. I'll give the Wicked Souls new bodies, with all or most of their original memories, and allow them to pick their own new names. Give them back a sense of ownership over themselves. I'll put them near the places where they committed their wrongdoings, and set them up to make up for the wrongdoings. For example, a child abuser might be given the task of comforting children abused by their parents. When I get to more recent arrivals in hell, I might give Wicked Souls the task of watching over their real grandchildren. I'll turn these Wicked Souls into perfect gar-ga-gardi...guardian a-angels. And if they falter and start to do wrong again, my demons will swoop in and remind them what they'll go back to if they mess up."

“You all know what you came here for! But before we get into it, a short word from our fantastic Police Chief: Mr Christopher Haze!” The crowd claps while some boo the appearance of the police chief onto the stage.

“Thank you all” the police chief looks slightly hesitant in front of the crowd, possibly due to the booing. “Thank you for coming tonight to the lottery, this is the fifth anniversary so I’m very happy you’re all here to experience it. I would like to remind all of you in attendance of the amazing work of our police force and to the ingenuity of you, our village members, in creating this yearly event as it’s impact on fighting our crime within the village has brought unprecedented success” the crowd uproars in cheer again as the clapping and whistling repeats.

“Now I won’t take up much more of your time, I just want to say a huge thank you to you all for giving hope back to our community. Have a good evening folks, thank you” clapping emanates across the vast crowd of eager villagers as one screams out ‘let’s get on with it’ as the main speaker appears on stage again.

“I know you’re all very excited so, with great pleasure, I announce we will now begin the lottery!” As the lights brighten the stage three crew members bring out the lottery wheel. The speaker spins the wheel and all the balls rattle inside, plunging and tumbling on top of each other until eventually the contraption is stopped and a winner is pulled from the top.

“Now before we reveal the winner let’s not forget what the prize is this year. Throughout our time in this wonderful village there have been people seeking to disrupt the peace. Some we give a slap on the wrist, but others...well they deserve something a bit extra. And the family that is going to give that punishment issss...” the crowd rises in voice as the rattling of drums builds suspension.

“The Johnson family! Get on up here folks!” The Johnson family excitedly rush on stage as some clap in excitement while others stand in disappointment. The Johnson family take up their position on the stage, they give the thumbs up to the main speaker and the curtain is dropped at the back of the stage, revealing three men and one woman with nooses around their necks.

There was only a minute left now, and I gave up on trying. She was probably hanging out with someone from school or something. Now I was alone.

I gasped. Silver stood right behind me, a smile on her face.

""I've been looking for you! Where have you been?"" I gently punched her shoulder.

""Listen, I'm sorry.""

""What could you possibly be sorry about, Silver? There's nothing wrong.""

""I'm sorry you'll have to go through it again."" Silver's eyes were still glued to the clock. Fifteen seconds remaining.

""What do I have to go through again? Is there something you're not telling me? Silver?""

""You thought you survived. You thought everyone just left you on your birthday, on new years, all alone. You thought that they didn't want you. It wasn't that. You just didn't live.""

I saw a girl, standing across the street. She waved at me. I waved back. She seemed familiar, but I didn't remember her.

My heart misses a beat. I have dreaded hearing this for twenty five years. I sit down, facing my husband across the table; my perfect, wonderful husband, who scooped me up from mundanity one day in high school, said all the right words, made all the right moves, and made my life enchanted. We’ve been through college, marriage, and the birth of two sons. I barely ever had any reason to complain. I must confess I was not so infallible myself, but he stood by me despite my mistakes. I kept hearing warnings, from my mom – *it’s too good to be true;* my dad – *you should get your act together*; my friends – *he’s hiding something*; his friends – *you don’t deserve him*; Truth is, their words only echoed my fears. I did not and still don’t understand how I was so lucky. At some point, I just accepted it.

“Is it about James?” I ask. Has to be about James. The one day I felt prey to lust and dared ask the question *what if it had been another?* I climbed into bed with a charming stranger and ten horrid minutes later climbed down and ran out to confess the whole thing to the man of my life. He could have yelled at me, but he just shook his head and smiled like he understood, and I loved him back all the more for it.

He’s shaking his head now with the same smile “No, it’s not that.”

Yet, we’re having *The Talk*. Whatever the reason, it is bad. I see he’s writing sentences in his minds, pondering each word. My heart is sinking. I’m going to be heartbroken, but it’s okay even if we break up. Couples divorce all the time. We’re going to be adults about it and do what’s right for our kids.

“I once married a wonderful woman” he begins “and she made the right man out of me…”

Humble, as always.

“…We weren’t perfect, but we stood together. Yet, In the back of my head, I always wondered how life could have been with my high school crush…”

Who is he talking about? That’s me.

He looks me dead in the eyes “…That’s you.”

I don’t understand.

“Back when I was 42 I found a class photo of ’95 with you on it and I remembered how lovely you were. I made a careless wish.”

But he’s 41.

“And I got it. I went back to being a teenager in 1995, and I lived my whole life a second time, with the experience of a grown man. I made no mistake. I got everything I wanted back then. I got you. But that’s not the same. It’s not as good. It’s not real.”

I can’t talk. I can’t even breathe.

“This is the night I made my wish. I miss my wife and my daughter. I’m going back.”

“What? When?”

“Any second now. I spared you as long as possible”

klsa7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/klsa7y/emily/,Emily,2356,93,1609168569.0,"Jennifer Harrison wanted to be a mommy so badly. She and her boyfriend had done everything right to conceive and after she'd done so, she tried to do everything right to make sure she had a healthy baby.

&#x200B;

That was why she'd called me. She told me I'd been recommended by a friend of hers. I'm a midwife, you see and I love what I do. I like being able to help people bring beautiful new lives into this world. I've even helped with home births, for those who wanted them. Some people like Jennifer, believe that they are more comfortable… Which isn’t untrue. However, if there are complications, like with her birth, things can go very wrong.

&#x200B;

I won’t go into the messy details. Just know that Jennifer’s little girl was stillborn. I assured her that I did the best I could and I think she truly believed that. 

&#x200B;

Losing a baby isn’t easy. I know that firsthand. Long ago, when I was young and stupid, I made the mistake of getting pregnant. I was still in high school. Just a teenager, but I was determined to take responsibility for my baby. I would’ve done just that if fate hadn’t been so cruel… No… Not fate… People. Teenage ‘sluts’ aren’t looked kindly upon and kids can be mean even at the best of times. I’m sure some people might have said that it was an accident that I ‘fell’ down the stairs at school and miscarried. But I knew I’d been pushed. People told me it was for the best, but I don’t believe that. I’ve never been able to conceive since, nor have I been able to forget the new life that died inside of me… 

&#x200B;

I’m sure Jennifer forgot, though. After all, she didn’t even recognize me once during the months where I helped her prepare for the baby she’d never have. She didn’t even seem to remember what she’d done to me. What she’d taken from me all those years ago…

&#x200B;

It was blind luck that brought us back together. Blind luck that allowed me to show her the pain I had been through because of her.

&#x200B;

But she’ll remember me soon enough. As I said, I understand Jennifer's grief. I know what it’s like to lose a baby. That’s why I invited her over to my place tonight for dinner. She probably thinks I pity her. I don’t. I simply want to remind her of our shared history and I’ve got the perfect meat roasting in the oven for us to indulge in. I must admit, preparing it was very simple. Not all that different from making a Thanksgiving turkey or a roast chicken. I know Jennifer won’t care for it once she finds out what it is, which is a real shame. After all, she’s technically the one who supplied it. I think she was going to name it Emily."

This christmas I got a really good present from my uncle. He normally gives the best presents, but this year he went way overboard. Last year he gave me the best, pinkest princess dress, but this year is even better. I’ve been sending Santa hundreds of letters asking for it, but he didn’t listen. But then the next day uncle visited us and gave me the giant, plush teddy bear. I was so happy! It was almost as big as I am and has a really cute bow tie. 

I was really happy with it the first few days. We played together, had tea parties and just had a lot of fun. I even gave him a name: mister Teddy! But then he started acting weird. He started making weird noises. It sounded like some kind of humming. After the humming his eyes started to glow red. Not the whole eye, just a little red dot. 

I don’t like Teddy anymore. I told mommy this, but she says I shouldn’t be so ungrateful. Teddy always stops when mommy or daddy comes into my room. They don’t believe me when I say he acts weird. 

I tried trowing Teddy away, but daddy won’t let me. I tried putting Teddy in the closet, but mommy takes him out and sets him on my bed when I do that. Teddy keeps staring at me with his red eyes. Please take him away. I don’t want Teddy anymore!"

Jordan repeated this fact to himself often. It became a mantra that he clutched close like a security blanket on a windy night. The only problem being that the perfectly normal yellow wallpaper kept changing. 

It started with the pattern. Jordan was washing his hands, staring at his pale face and puffy eyes in the mirror, when he felt a *shift*. The feeling was similar to vertigo, over in an instant. 

Maybe it was only his imagination, Jordan thought. Then he noticed that the horizontal lines on the faded wallpaper were now vertical. He was sure, *positive*, that they were not always vertical. Well, 99-percent sure. 

Jordan leaned in close to the wall, squinting. That’s when the smell hit him. Stale air and ammonia. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d cleaned the downstairs bathroom but now it reeked of freshness. Bleach. Flowers. Jordan took a deep breath and gagged. Under the cloying sweetness, something was rotting. 

The pattern shifted again. Now small white flowers twisted across the top of the wallpaper and Jordan could hear the sound of sobbing. He ran from the bathroom and hid upstairs. But the sound grew louder, deafening, until Jordan couldn’t ignore it. He ran back to the bathroom.

The wallpaper was completely transformed now. Instead of being a ragged yellow, it was clean blue. The flower work at the edges was delicate, detailed, familiar. All of it was familiar but Jordan couldn’t remember why. Only that it had something to do with his grandmother.

Now that the door was open, the sobbing was louder. The sound filled the small bathroom but seemed to be coming from the mirror. Jordan inched into the room and froze. There was no reflection in the mirror. Instead, Jordan was looking *up* through an open door into a different room. He saw the same blue wallpaper with the pretty at the edge of his vision. Above him was a white ceiling.

A shadow crossed his vision. As the form leaned down, Jordan recognized the red, weeping face of his sister. He tried to reach out but found his body locked, stuck in position looking out through the open door. As his sister walked away, the door began to close. 

Jordan was frozen. He tried to turn away but there was no mirror anymore. Only the closing door and the shrinking sliver of ceiling and wallpaper. As the world went black, Jordan finally realized why that wallpaper looked so familiar. He’d seen it before when he was a child, not long after his grandmother had died. Jordan remembered staring at the flowers on the wall that day because he was scared and very sad. He missed his grandmother and he’d never been in a funeral home before. 

As the door closed, cutting off the light and the sound of crying, Jordan was left in perfect darkness."

Until she got pregnant, then she started complaining that her unborn baby daughter was an alcoholic and also had an addiction to ciggarettes. She started to smoke and drink alcohol and at the same time she would sob uncontrollably. She would shout out loud that her unborn baby daughter had the addiction and she could feel it. My father constantly shouted at her and scolded her for harming the health of his future wife. 

Then my sister started to claim that her baby daughter now had a new addiction while still inside her womb. She didn't tell us what it is though at first but this new addiction was an addition to the other two addictions. We could all hear her sobbing whenever she was drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. We were all wondering what her new third addiction was? and my father kept on saying that she better not be harming the future health of his future wife any further. 

We then found my sister in the alley way eating a homeless man, the homeless man was dead and it now looked like her unborn baby daughter had a strong taste for human meat. She has been taken away to be examined. Something is wrong really wrong."
