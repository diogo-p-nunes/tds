gf8tdci,t3_ka7yk9,"Not that subtle a twist really, after the ""grapes"" it was obvious. Did not lessen the impact in any way though! So good and disgusting!! Thank you!",t3_ka7yk9
gf8sghj,t3_ka7yk9,"
I realize this is a very subtle plot twist so for those of you who don't get it, the secret is revealed below!

>!The girl's mom is feeding the girl her own body parts, her fingers, eyes and brain.!<

Enjoy!",t3_ka7yk9
gf8ylbr,t3_ka7yk9,Gross!,t3_ka7yk9
gf9ppnl,t3_ka7yk9,"Loved this story, but Iâ€™m curious as to how the child could eat when sheâ€™d consumed her fingers? Surely she knew they were gone?",t3_ka7yk9
gf94fhy,t3_ka7yk9,"Wow that took me a second to process, awesome story! I might start writing some stories myself soon, I used to be into it but got demoralized as a young kid. Parents were never very supportive. Reading your story has inspired me to try again, maybe just short posts on here at first, but perhaps one day I'll have the morale to make more!

Thanks for reading and awesome story!",t3_ka7yk9
gf9p4bc,t3_ka7yk9,I didn't actually get it. I thought her mom was feeding her worms or something... I feel kinda dum,t3_ka7yk9
gfjwhk3,t3_ka7yk9,I understood mini sausages to be mum's fingers.. but it got even darker... and darker...,t3_ka7yk9
gf8uwd4,t1_gf8tdci,Maybe I overestimated my abilities to be sneaky ;) thank you though!!,t3_ka7yk9
gf9q7pd,t1_gf8tdci,Wasnâ€™t obvious to me. I just thought the mum was poisoning the girl. It wasnâ€™t until someone commented here that i got it!,t3_ka7yk9
gf907c8,t1_gf8sghj,"Oh, I thought she was feeding her other ppls body parts, and it was causing her to get kuru and everytime im she ate human flesh it got worse, causing her to shake and lose her dexterity which is why it was hard to hold the fork and her brain hurt. I thought the mom turned off the light for the meal because it was too hard to disguise eyeballs as anything else, especially since it seemed she didn't bother to hide them in other food. I don't know how you could eat your own spaghettified brain, little pieces at a time like on Hannibal maybe, but to have enough of her brain spaghetti'd to fill her up? I don't think she would be any kind of conscious even if she was still alive. But I like the concept, there's just a few things that don't make sense to me...",t3_ka7yk9
gf966j3,t1_gf8sghj,I thought the spaghetti is her bowels and was wondering how did that work if she was eating.,t3_ka7yk9
gf9dc3y,t1_gf8sghj,"Ohhhh!! I was thinking the ""spaghetti"" was her hair! How did the mom get the kid's brain into the bowl/onto the plate without opening the kid's head up?",t3_ka7yk9
gf8zghn,t1_gf8ylbr,Why thank you!,t3_ka7yk9
gf9dsis,t1_gf94fhy,Awesome! never too late to write some creepy stuff! good luck mate,t3_ka7yk9
gf8w2ff,t1_gf8uwd4,It was very sneaky and subtle for me! I thought it was other people's body parts ğŸ¥²,t3_ka7yk9
gf90s2w,t1_gf907c8,Ooh all good ideas! I know a lot of it doesn't make make sense lol I wanted it to be a little abstract. And the way I pictured the part with the brain was that the girl was actually sucking strands directly out of her head. But thanks for the advice!!!,t3_ka7yk9
gfbf0hl,t1_gf9dsis,Thanks friend!,t3_ka7yk9
gf8wdox,t1_gf8w2ff,Ahaha thank you!!! I'm glad :),t3_ka7yk9
gf9d7u2,t1_gf8w2ff,"I did, too! Now, after reading your comment and thinking about it, I'm realizing the ""grapes"" were her own eyes, not someone else's. I'd already picked up on the fingers being her own by the end of the story, but... ewwww!!!",t3_ka7yk9
