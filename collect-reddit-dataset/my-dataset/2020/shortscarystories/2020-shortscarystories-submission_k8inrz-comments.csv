I struggled with body dysmorphia quite badly when I was growing up so this story feels quite close to my heart. Hope you guys enjoy.

geyfe6g,t3_k8inrz,"Wow! I've never wanted to carve up my own face, but I know what it's like to look in the mirror and wish that I could change what I see. Growing up, I often obsessed over my appearance; knowing that something was wrong, but unable to pinpoint what it was. I realized later in life that it wasn't real, my brain was obsessing over phantoms, but it sure felt real at the time.",t3_k8inrz
