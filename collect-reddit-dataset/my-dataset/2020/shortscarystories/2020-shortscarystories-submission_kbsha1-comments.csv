gfla1po,t1_gfl48su,"A giant spider sells her venom for gold and uses the gold to buy child slaves. The slaves take care of her eggs and are food for the spiderlings when they hatch. One slave escapes, finds a centipede egg, and takes care of it until it hatches and eats him. The point is that both species exploited him. The spider used fear to coerce him, but the centipede was more subtle and used his loneliness and anger against him.",t3_kbsha1
