gh871zl,t3_klb2pg,"Interesting idea, but proofreading would have helped you a lot. A lot of broken sentences, or things that didn't flow due to lack of breaks and lack of words. Shows some promise though, definitely.",t3_klb2pg
gh9r9jy,t3_klb2pg,The idea seems cool but the story was very hard to understand? A lot of loose words and sentences.,t3_klb2pg
gh7vj6v,t3_klb2pg,I hope you like this story I had fun writing It :),t3_klb2pg
gh83d5l,t3_klb2pg,"I loved this.  You need to expand it, turn it into a series and post it on r/nosleep because this has everything it needs to be so much bigger",t3_klb2pg

gh876gz,t1_gh871zl,Yay the grammar could definitely be better,t3_klb2pg
gh83oot,t1_gh83d5l,Thnxs :) I was thinking about post there it just I have bad grammar but i guess I could just more to it,t3_klb2pg
gh84hp3,t1_gh8481c,Thnxs :) I am thinking about maybe doing a series about this (not on subreddit or course because of the rules) and I am glad you think that :),t3_klb2pg
gh87jci,t1_gh876gz,"Grammar, yes, and just making sure a sentence has all the words needed to make it work correctly, to make sure it says what you want. A lot of what I saw was maybe misspellings, or just that you got going in a rush and skipped some words. Proofreading, it's important lol",t3_klb2pg
gh843q4,t1_gh83oot,"I would happily proof read your stories for you. Grammar and spelling shouldn't stop you from being creative.  All you'd have to do is post them as a private message to me, I'd correct them and send them back. I wouldn't alter your work or try to pass it off as my own but I would like to read more about this story and others you've written.

Just remember this sub reddit doesn't allow series of stories. A single tale is all that's allowed",t3_klb2pg
gh8dtld,t1_gh83oot,If you do make it a longer story try to make a longer build up between logs 1 2 and 3 so maybe 3 could be log 10 or 15,t3_klb2pg
gh84cfd,t1_gh843q4,"That is very kind of you :) and I will probably won't make it into a series (mostly because I don't know how to make a link on my phone), maybe I DM you when I am finish",t3_klb2pg
gh84leq,t1_gh84cfd,The offer is there for any stories and I give you word as a granny that I will keep them absolutely secret,t3_klb2pg
