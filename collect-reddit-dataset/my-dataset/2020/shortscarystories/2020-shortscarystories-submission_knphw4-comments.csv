ghlofhu,t3_knphw4,"**Soundtrack: Code Orange - Swallowing the Rabbit Whole**

Ah, TV Shop, the absolute height of early 90's entertainment. I'd sit up for weeks on end talking to the strange flickering men and women desperately trying to barter for my soul, and they'd show me such wonderfully disturbing sights in return. Sights that would soon follow me wherever I went. 

But that's a story for another day.
