gekq56f,t3_k612xz,I canâ€™t sleep with open closets either.  this is great!,t3_k612xz
geluzxm,t3_k612xz,All are talking about what kind of shower curtains they have and I'm just like...I don't have a shower curtain!?!?,t3_k612xz
genmjb7,t3_k612xz,I always do that,t3_k612xz
gezzbbd,t3_k612xz,"Good thing I have an excellent security team. The Chihuahua barks at scary things, then runs under the bed. The huge Labrador, alerted by the barking, goes to investigate. The Dachshund follows behind the Lab, growling, eager to prove she isn't just a wiener. Meanwhile, I yell from the bathtub, ""Stop all that racket! Just kill it and shut up already!""",t3_k612xz
geo0y9o,t3_k612xz,I jerk in the shower so i donâ€™t know why u wanna creep on me homie,t3_k612xz
geigfrq,t1_gei8l4o,"I was thinking about that, and also glass shower doors!",t3_k612xz
gejnrqd,t1_gejj9y9,"I've honestly never heard of a shower variation like this :) maybe I've seen it but the image of it escapes me... 

How about when you open your eyes after rinsing you hair, you see a shadow on the other side of the glass?",t3_k612xz
gek5sq4,t1_gejujty,Baths are just as dangerous! Supernatural scares are the worst!,t3_k612xz
gek57at,t1_gek4cjx,"You're welcome! I'm comforted to know I'm not the only one horrified by this! I am also scared of slightly open closet doors, dark hallways, and the deep end of the pool.... lol",t3_k612xz
gemdhws,t1_geluzxm,Personal choice?,t3_k612xz
gejnpip,t1_geigfrq,My shower door is glass but it gives a blurry effect. So...ya never know.,t3_k612xz
gek3omv,t1_gejnrqd,"I always create a barrier with my hands when rinsing so I don't have to close my eyes while in the shower. The top of the curtain is also see-through so I can see outside the shower. I love scary stories and horror movies, but that shit's gotten me paranoid over the years apparently haha.",t3_k612xz
gek48y7,t1_gejnrqd,*I don't close my eyes when I rinse my hair*,t3_k612xz
geknm73,t1_gejnrqd,People close their eyes when they ways their hair???,t3_k612xz
gelc5yf,t1_gejnrqd,Yeah thatâ€™s called adjusting to the things that create shadows and have one casted from the light since your behind a curtain..,t3_k612xz
gek6051,t1_gek57at,yeah me too!! when i was in third grade my english teacher told us a story about an old lady being in her closet (a ghost) and it kind of scarred me so i canâ€™t sleep with my closet door open and it always has to be shut lol,t3_k612xz
gelc3pw,t1_gejnpip,If you canâ€™t look through frosted glass and see thereâ€™s someone behind it then man you need eye checkingss,t3_k612xz
gek4ww9,t1_gek3omv,"I've always had that irrational fear thanks to horror movies. Like as soon as you open your eyes after rinsing your hair, something would be there... I hate it!",t3_k612xz
gek54jc,t1_gek48y7,Do you wipe the mirror after a shower? The classic horror movie cliche of having something  behind you after doing so >:],t3_k612xz
gel1eun,t1_geknm73,Definitely! Sometimes you want to let the water run down from head to toe!,t3_k612xz
gek6sci,t1_gek6051,"I have to do the same, I hate the feeling of thinking something could be in there just STARING at me... and don't get me started on leaving your foot hanging off the bed.... even though I don't have a bed frame at the moment, it's still creepy!!!",t3_k612xz
gl0ifac,t1_gelc3pw,"Actually, I have bad eyes and so I literally cannot see in the shower ðŸ˜‚ Plus my husband's jacket hangs in the bathroom so if I catch a glimpse of it, it looks like a person.",t3_k612xz
gek5ca1,t1_gek54jc,My wall is pure white (NOT my choice) would already see it. >:D,t3_k612xz
gel1frp,t1_gel1eun,"Hi definitely! sometimes you want to let the water run down from head to toe!, I'm dad.",t3_k612xz
gek72wl,t1_gek6sci,oh god thatâ€™s the worst!!,t3_k612xz
gelc953,t1_gek5ca1,Fuck that. It always is on my mind when I turn the light in and look in the mirror or wipe it down. Plus if itâ€™s lit up and Iâ€™ll still see a blurry figure behind me if I wipe it. These are all debunkable easily.,t3_k612xz
gelih4i,t1_gel1frp,Didnâ€™t work,t3_k612xz
gem1gek,t1_gelc953,Well technically I do have one bathroom fear. My bathroom door will slightly close when I leave and I fear that there is something or *someone* there.,t3_k612xz
genowep,t1_gelih4i,"That was awkward, till I saw it was a bot.",t3_k612xz
genotns,t1_gem1gek,"Oh when doors slightly close and you can see or hear it, that's so eerie!!!",t3_k612xz
gevfdvo,t1_genowep,Replied before i saw that too,t3_k612xz
genso9t,t1_genotns,Yeah it is,t3_k612xz
