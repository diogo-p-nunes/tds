ggoe87r,t3_khyg2c,This is a really good story; I'm not quite sure I understand the ending though. Was the pounding his parents or intruders abusing the little boy?,t3_khyg2c
ggoendq,t3_khyg2c,I thought this was gonna be about Calvin and Hobbes for a sec.,t3_khyg2c
ggnw8ga,t3_khyg2c,"Nice, upvoted",t3_khyg2c
ggogkfd,t3_khyg2c,"As much as this story is scary, it is also sad. Great job ‚ô°",t3_khyg2c
ggoeip3,t3_khyg2c,Now I have goosebumps and I‚Äôm sadüôÉ,t3_khyg2c

ggod7do,t3_khyg2c,Nooooo,t3_khyg2c
ggom6r2,t3_khyg2c,"Did I type this story right before bed and immediately pass out, with no memory of writing it upon waking up? Certainly not! (Okay, maybe...) 

Be sure to check out r/petrifyingpink , my slowly growing subreddit for my stories!",t3_khyg2c
ggoqlxb,t3_khyg2c,And now I‚Äôm crying. Having kids has ruined me for stories like this üò≠ nicely done OP,t3_khyg2c
ggp351j,t3_khyg2c,"OP this was great!! I loved the way you narrated Mister Beeps thoughts!!! Also quick question, is Mister Beep just a pink cat or does he have any other features? (This story was fantastic!!)",t3_khyg2c
ggonuyg,t3_khyg2c,"Wow this is great. Reminds me of that comic where the little girl‚Äôs stuffed animals jump out the window so they don‚Äôt have to deal with her abuse...

Sad, OP! But well done!",t3_khyg2c
ggujrgh,t3_khyg2c,"Great story! Mr. Beep is doing his best for poor Calvin. 

One small point of criticism--week old babies are too young to laugh or put their fists in their mouth. Babies laugh starting at around 3 months, and can bring their hands up to their mouth starting at around 1 month.",t3_khyg2c
ggoojdn,t3_khyg2c,More like short wholesome story‚Äôs,t3_khyg2c

ggom35a,t1_ggoe87r,Open to interpretation :),t3_khyg2c
ggohex0,t1_ggoe87r,"Most likely an abusive parent, or at least that's what I think",t3_khyg2c
ggoqudh,t1_ggoe87r,Seemed like an abusive parent situation and they are the monsters,t3_khyg2c
ggp3wix,t1_ggoe87r,I think something like a robbery or smth,t3_khyg2c

ggon4a0,t1_ggoendq,"Lol I didn‚Äôt realize that! Normally in writing I‚Äôll pick any name that speaks to me, and no wonder Calvin was the first name I thought of!",t3_khyg2c
ggu7fum,t1_ggoqlxb,Same :(,t3_khyg2c
ggpjtai,t1_ggp351j,"To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure! Imaginary friends evolve over time, as the kid develops. Of course, he might have stayed the same if Calvin just wanted to hold onto his nostalgia. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt mind having a protective pink kitty in my life!",t3_khyg2c
ggpr97n,t1_ggonuyg,"oof, yeah. clarissa. that comic series scarred me lol",t3_khyg2c
gjjckoh,t1_ggplsvg,"This, this is the only good interpretation of the story.",t3_khyg2c
