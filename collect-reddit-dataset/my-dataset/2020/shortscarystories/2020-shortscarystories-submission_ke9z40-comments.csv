gg3mhol,t3_ke9z40,Was so immersed in the helI experience that I thought it was actual hell you were writing about. Great writing!,t3_ke9z40
gg1inna,t3_ke9z40,"That is the best short scary story that is actually short and scary I've seen in a while, great job!",t3_ke9z40
gg1gtpg,t3_ke9z40,This is extremely good writing. Love it!,t3_ke9z40
gg1xuhc,t3_ke9z40,"Actually the buzzing ceiling light is very scary, coupled with all the torture... amazing short story.. But....

What’s the point of it, if you can’t remember that you’ve been suffering forever? That’s just five minutes for the culprit. He doesn’t know that he is in hell and doesn’t know that there’s no end to his suffering. He runs to the tunnel thinking that it’s all over. If he knew he was in hell, he wouldn’t have run at all, cause he knows it’s not going to get over, ever!!! you get my point. Not a fan of the reset button. 

Your story is great.. but I’m talking bout a similar episode in black mirror!",t3_ke9z40

gg50bb0,t1_gg1wrpj,I love The Twilight Zone! I remember this episode. There was a newer version where this pool boy killed the husband and they kept him in a dream state experiencing the death he caused over and over again.,t3_ke9z40
