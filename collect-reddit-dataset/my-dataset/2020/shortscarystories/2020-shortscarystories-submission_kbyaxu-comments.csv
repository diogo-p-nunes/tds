gflh9as,t3_kbyaxu,"This is my first post on this thread, inspired by a night when I was writing an essay at like 3am and felt like something was watching me. It was a horrible feeling, so naturally, I decided to make it worse by writing this. Hooray",t3_kbyaxu
gflwics,t3_kbyaxu,"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you!

Neat story.",t3_kbyaxu
gflt019,t3_kbyaxu,"I really liked this, it made me feel funny inside. Well done!",t3_kbyaxu
gfm1mll,t3_kbyaxu,Omg does it reset and she is too paranoid to notice? It starts at 2:42 and ends at 2:40!,t3_kbyaxu
gfmiq3i,t3_kbyaxu,"im not. im. not. 
paranoia deals with the pysch right? but if im paranoid would my paranoid be afraid if i stop being paranoid? pananoia needs a host to live. uh oh. im thinking outloud. i told u im not. stop asking if i am. fuck im not really paranoid, this is a prank and ur on live tv. haha truman showed",t3_kbyaxu
gfnjdzx,t3_kbyaxu,I'm sure she's fine. Totally fine. üòê,t3_kbyaxu
gfnka22,t3_kbyaxu,Paranoid? I thought I was just stoned.,t3_kbyaxu
gfm2nk1,t1_gflwics,"Thank you! Whenever I get freaked out I tend to appeal to reason (and I consider myself to be a logical person for the most part), so I wanted to have this poor character share my thought process. I would definitely die in a horror movie lmao",t3_kbyaxu
gfm4jev,t1_gfm1mll,"it does! I don‚Äôt have a really specific idea of what‚Äôs happening to her, but she‚Äôs trapped in a time loop of some kind. When I get scared, I usually tell myself something along the lines of ‚Äúthis will pass... you‚Äôll feel better soon‚Äù, so I had to take that away too. (I basically wrote this to scare myself...) 

In her case, I think she‚Äôs going to be paranoid forever, but will refuse to believe anything supernatural is happening.",t3_kbyaxu
gfnar1y,t1_gfm4jev,That‚Äôs some twilight zone stuff right there,t3_kbyaxu
