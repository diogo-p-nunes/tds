gfdno8m,t1_gfdlfga,"Thanks but this isn't 100% orignal. It is inspired by a meme
I semi fleshed it out",t3_kaiitt
gfdnq97,t1_gfdn604,Ikr! Slaughtering whole families and tormenting the children before killing them is so funny! That's why I do it all the time!,t3_kaiitt
gfdhe6m,t1_gfcv7xg,"Kinda yes
I saw this meme a while ago(not in holup but I am sure it must have been posted there too) 
I then expanded it a lil bit and made the narrator a proper killer (it's implied he killed the kids parents and then tried to find the kid)


Before the dude just told the kid he  will help him get to his parents and the kid said they were dead and then the narrator said the promise line",t3_kaiitt
gffioxe,t1_gfdhf4p,Have you ever heard of an expression? (I'm being sarcastic for the idoits who can't tell.),t3_kaiitt
gfdnyz0,t1_gfdno8m,"IMO, it doesn't need to be 100% original to be a great story, that's your case, it's very well written! 
and the inspiration you had is in the story, but it's subtle, not obvious, and I think that makes your story even better :)",t3_kaiitt
gfdnugq,t1_gfdnq97,"Nah I mean the execution is just *chefs kiss* 

Oh... Well... Err I've never done this before.... But I guess a promise.... Is a promise",t3_kaiitt
gfdnqmv,t1_gfdnq97,"For legal reasons that was a joke
 I am replying to some comments in character(the character being the murderer from the story)",t3_kaiitt
