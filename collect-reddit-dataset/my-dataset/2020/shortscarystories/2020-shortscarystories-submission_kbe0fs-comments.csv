gfgjj7g,t3_kbe0fs,"As you all know, I’m a huge fan of body horror. I know it isn’t for everyone but it’s definitely for me! I had lots of fun writing this one. Also, who *actually* likes blisters?! No one. 

As always, feedback is very welcome. If you’d like to see more of my work, please check out my subreddit r/writesaboutallthings. Whilst you’re at it, check out some really cool and talented writers over at r/TheCrypticCompendium. 
Thank you!",t3_kbe0fs

gfgvczd,t3_kbe0fs,"Nicely done! I love body horror stories as well, they’re always so interesting and to be honest they’re the only kinds of scary stories that can truly scare me!
I did wanna mention though, at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph you said “usually I can avoid the pain but mostly I’m not so lucky.” I’d suggest changing that a bit, since it doesn’t make too much sense using usually and mostly since they can mean the same thing. Maybe “sometimes I’m not so lucky” if you were trying to go for the vibe that it only happens every so often?
I hope this doesn’t come off as rude, I’m only trying to share a bit of constructive criticism :)",t3_kbe0fs
