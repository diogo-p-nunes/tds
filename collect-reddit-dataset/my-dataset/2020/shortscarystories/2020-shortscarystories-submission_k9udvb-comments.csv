gf6el4k,t3_k9udvb,"/u/atwproductions, I have found some errors in your post:

 > “horrible, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like a scream”

 > “~~Its~~ [**It's**] about the people”

I see that it is you, atwproductions, that could have typed “horrible, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like a scream” and “~~Its~~ [**It's**] about the people” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.
