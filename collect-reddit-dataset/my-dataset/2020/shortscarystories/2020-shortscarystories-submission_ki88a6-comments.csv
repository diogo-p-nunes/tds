ggvspp4,t3_ki88a6,"He’s a serial killer—one who does... something... to the bodies. Something horrible & private that we surely don’t WANT to know—some ritualistic kind of trophy thing... 

... but an important part of the ritual, the part that makes his victims “his”... 

... is that they must never be SEEN by any other eyes but his, once his ritual has begun (which seems to include poisoning.) 

Having had his ritual spoiled by a cop pulling him over — though the cop misunderstands the situation, and he isn’t arrested — the killer simply dumps the victim, who is no longer “trophy material.”

Lucky for the victim’s family, who will get closure at least—if she is found. 

TL;DR: Serial killer’s creepy ritual is interrupted by cop pullover. While killer escapes with easy lie, creepy ritual is ruined; killer dumps body (family will at least have closure) & moves on to seek new prey.",t3_ki88a6
