gh0plvp,t3_kk5mpn,That's an amazing story in such a short amount of words! I look forward to your writing in the future.,t3_kk5mpn
gh0xbxu,t3_kk5mpn,"****Here is the same story at a little over 500 words.*****


I had waited for hours in those cold woods. The sun was beginning to set and the wind was howling when the delivery truck finally arrived. I held my breath in worry and balled up my fists in rage as the young inexperienced man who looked like he was in his early twentys brought out the large wooden crate from the back and loaded it up on a dolly. He then pushed it through the perfectly manicured lawn. He came to a large staircase and I sweated and sweared as I watched him clumsily move the crate up each one. Once the delivery crew had left I waited for an unknown amount of time for the tacky woman who bought it to return home in her sleek black foreign import driven by a man who I'm sure was not paid hardly enough for the work he put in. Once they both entered the house I found a place in the woods facing a large open window. There it was sitting on a pedestal with twin lights illuminating it. It was just as beautiful as ever.

 ""I just had to have it!""

The eccentric rich woman said in a rushed excited tone into an old fashion ivory telephone receiver. She marveled at a unimaginablely beautiful vase. It was a very old one of a kind item with swirling gold inlayed into it's cream colored surface. There were faded symbols that were rumored to be a code long forgotten. ""You know they said it once was owned by a Queen."" She tossed her head back and laughed an airy laugh that echoed in the grand entry hall. Her eyes rolled and her face quickly became stern. ""I know, I know, but I don't believe in those silly stories."" She ran a finger down the delegate gold patterns. ""Martha don't worry so much it gives you wrinkles."" She then let out a loud frustrated sigh before responding. ""Curses don't exist, are you sure you are not just jealous of my fabulous vase."" She then ran her long fake nail in a ring across the opening at the top of the vase following the gold ring that decorated it's entrance. ""Sure I will meet you at the restaurant in an hour."" With that I watched her set down the receiver and lovingly admire the vase once more before leaving the room.

I put away the binoculars and made quick work of cutting the brake line. When I was done I put away my tools into my black leather bag and set out into the woods. I smiled to myself as I walked through the fallen leaves. Her time had come the moment she put in her bid on my vase. It had almost been too easy and now I will wait and follow the vase to the next owner.
My beautiful vase. The only thing I have ever loved. It will always be mine to view but never to own. I am the killer and I am the curse.",t3_kk5mpn
gh0u9wu,t3_kk5mpn,"Short and sweet and creepy, I also feel it would be an interesting idea to expand further! Good job.",t3_kk5mpn
gh1ec0r,t3_kk5mpn,Read and enjoyed both versions. I look forward to reading more from you!!,t3_kk5mpn
gh12feu,t3_kk5mpn,I loved this and the only criticism is that I wish you had run spell check prior to posting.,t3_kk5mpn

gh1gt51,t3_kk5mpn,This was enjoyable! Merry Christmas!,t3_kk5mpn
gh1wuvc,t3_kk5mpn,"This may be just me, but I have a feeling the character described is the ghost of the original owner, since the character seems to have done this for a very long time (especially apparent in the longer version written by OP in the comments) and they never get caught. Also the part ‚Äòmine to view, but never have‚Äô would make more sense as a ghost cannot (probably) own the vase, cause, you know, they‚Äôre ghosts. I‚Äôd even go as far as to say that maybe the vase is the only reason that they are still on Earth as ghost or not, as they seem very, very protective of the vase, but that may just be because they love it so much.

(Maybe even the character is the maker of the vase, leading to an even more normal reason of their overprotectiveness of it)",t3_kk5mpn
gh1q7tl,t3_kk5mpn,The ending feels rushed but I love the idea! I may be just nitpicking.,t3_kk5mpn

gh21qpc,t3_kk5mpn,Sturdy vase to survive a car accident,t3_kk5mpn
gh28baa,t3_kk5mpn,"This is really good! Though there is one thing I don't understand. Is the storyteller the vase's curse who does whatever it does (probably murder) to the vase's owner, or was s/he cursed to follow the vase wherever it goes?

EDIT: nvm I read your comment that specifically stated ""I am the killer"". Thanks anyway!",t3_kk5mpn

gh0oqbw,t1_gh0ju7m,Nice! Your soul is safe,t3_kk5mpn
gh0km2v,t1_gh0ju7m,You might need to explain this one. Im guessing it‚Äôs a serial killer who kills the owner of the vase?,t3_kk5mpn

gh2gi6u,t1_gh21qpc,The vase is in the rich woman's home. The killer is outside watching her and she is going out to eat with a friend later so the killer takes a chance to cut her brake line so she would die in an accident.,t3_kk5mpn
