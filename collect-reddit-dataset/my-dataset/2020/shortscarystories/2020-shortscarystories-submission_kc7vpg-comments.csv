Seems... r/suspiciouslyspecific",t3_kc7vpg
gfprfc3,t3_kc7vpg,I don't get it. What did he go down there for?,t3_kc7vpg
gfok5i3,t3_kc7vpg,The way that the text and the deepness were converging...  Congrats bro,t3_kc7vpg
gfoqdxn,t3_kc7vpg,Good job,t3_kc7vpg
gfoa2tn,t3_kc7vpg,Damn this is fantastic.,t3_kc7vpg
gfphxgq,t3_kc7vpg,"Really, really good. It doesn't hurt that deep water is one of my more horrifying scenarios....",t3_kc7vpg
gfplo1d,t3_kc7vpg,The whole abyss scenario is horrifying to me but this was also so beautiful and alluring...,t3_kc7vpg
gfsch9m,t3_kc7vpg,"This is lovely and a delightful last read before bed. The only thing I would point out, if you were to professionally publish, is that SCUBA regulators don't control your lung size or expand them when you dive into deeper water. They just regulate the flow so you're getting the right amount of air for the pressure you're under. In my experience it isn't uncomfortable and I don't notice breathing labor anywhere in the ""sunshine zone"" despite pressure. Only my ears, before popping them.",t3_kc7vpg
gfqmez0,t3_kc7vpg,"Oh man this is really good. It gets worse and worse and then it hits you, it's just beginning. 

Well written.",t3_kc7vpg
gfqsd86,t3_kc7vpg,"Very nice, great descriptions and I really like your writing style",t3_kc7vpg
gfrnyqa,t3_kc7vpg,"Thank you so much everyone, what lovely comments to wake up to!  
I love a good bit of 2nd person and I hope I can improve in the future.  
Thanks again for reading!",t3_kc7vpg
gfpv4ow,t1_gfprfc3,"Sounds like he was dying anyway, and decided drowning was better than cancer and a divorce.",t3_kc7vpg
gfsd9dx,t1_gfsch9m,"Thank you so much for the feedback! Yeah I think I struggled with wording the feeling of SCUBA diving and definitely could have capitalised on the ear pressure equalisation, by far one of the most recognisable experiences of being underwater.",t3_kc7vpg
gfqh95p,t1_gfpv4ow,I liked this. I love it when authors add stuff to their stories by adding in throwaway lines!,t3_kc7vpg
gfsdvre,t1_gfsd9dx,"Well to go with the circular theme of breath, I do think that the first breath is hard! I suddenly have to begin breathing in a way completely unnatural to me, as a nose breather. Could mention that!
Like,
""The first breath is always the hardest; a deep gasp through your lips when you break the surface. With your nose sealed away and useless, you have to carry on with these dry gasps, manual and methodical. In. Out.""

I don't mean to nitpick but I really liked the story and feel you could publish it somewhere! If not in a collection.",t3_kc7vpg
gfseeqt,t1_gfsdvre,"Yes! This is what unwanted to capture! If only I had your words! 
I think I ended up spending more time thinking of a title that spelled SCUBA than dealing with that first breath. Ah well, all the more to improve next time around.
Thank you so much for taking the time to reply so thoughtfully and constructively!",t3_kc7vpg
gft25ty,t1_gfseeqt,"I JUST NOW SAW THAT YOUR TITLE SPELLS SCUBA

that's so cool!!!!",t3_kc7vpg
