geld2ci,t3_k6jm13,I usually don't care for these types of posts but this was pretty good. The rhymes and the flow were very tight.,t3_k6jm13
gen495r,t3_k6jm13,I read it as i usually read the storybooks for my students. And it made it worse lol,t3_k6jm13
genozx4,t3_k6jm13,"Good job. Well written. 

But on the other hand... if you need to reach out, please do so. Lots of people willing to listen.",t3_k6jm13
genamdh,t3_k6jm13,"The style was so unique, combined with the rhyming and actual meaning, this was amazing.

Good job OP!",t3_k6jm13
geobemb,t3_k6jm13,"There are many attempts at rhymes in this sub; nearly ALL of them are decent, above average stories... but they miss the mark on a crucial point: meter. 

Meter is a like the bones of a rhyming poem, & if it’s OFF, it’s like going down castle steps with your eyes shut—the random depths give you groundshock, again and again. 

(Think that old song “Down in Africa” by Toto... “... above the ... SERengetEEEE...” 

THAT’S crappy meter, how the singer needs to mispronounce a word EVERYONE knows is SerenGETi just to shoehorn it.) 

I notice meter because I write for kids, early readers, who literally can’t read a poem whose meter is off AT ALL. 

Yours is nearly PERFECT. Bravo!",t3_k6jm13
geng181,t3_k6jm13,"I feel like you are short a stanza.  Something about leaping so far, not touching the ground and becoming the most popular kid because of it all. Just a thought.  Very nice.",t3_k6jm13
gentybz,t3_k6jm13,👍👍👍,t3_k6jm13
geopm3q,t3_k6jm13,GOOD. VERY.,t3_k6jm13
gesr6zb,t1_gen495r,You didn’t like it?,t3_k6jm13
gesqz4f,t1_geobemb,"Thanks you! It is fairly hard to keep the meter consistent, even I wish I could have kept the same meter throughout the entire poem. I just tried to keep mine consistent within each couplet. 

Honestly I’d attribute the success of great poets like Dr. Zeus and Shakespeare to the fact that they had consistent meter throughout their entire poems. How they did it I have no idea. It took me like half an hour to write just these three stanzas.",t3_k6jm13
gesravt,t1_geng181,"I mean, he definitely didn’t hit the ground.",t3_k6jm13
gf4hrwx,t1_gesr6zb,They meant creepier,t3_k6jm13
gesstun,t1_gesqz4f,"You are GOOD. It was wonderful to read, over and over. Thanks.",t3_k6jm13
gevleya,t1_gesqz4f,"Personally, Dr. Suess is kind of a cheat, lol. He makes up words to make stuff fit.",t3_k6jm13
gessy48,t1_gesstun,you’re welcome,t3_k6jm13

gewrgxi,t1_gewj57h,"Easy, killer, lol. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. We are all relatively anonymous here on Reddit, which is good and bad. 

Anonymity can give people courage to post experimental writing — & learn, & sometimes get beneficial feedback: in your case? That you have talent & skill. 

One awesome facet of this sub is the genuinely nice commenting I see. 

What I haven’t seen, yet, till now? “I’d like to see YOU try...” (that doesn’t sound very nice—in response to my little joke.) 

For all we know about each other, I MIGHT be an accomplished children’s poet. You might be, too. 

I might even have performed at Manhattan’s Poet’s House, by invitation. Or maybe you did. Never know...? 

Either way... since we don’t know... let’s assume the best about each other. Shall we?

EDIT: I wasn’t “complaining,” ha ha. I was kidding. Hence the “Lol.”",t3_k6jm13
geycw9b,t1_gewrgxi,"Ah really sorry.
I used to be a big fan of Dr Zeus as a kid. Like I memorized all of his books by heart and everything.
I apologize for being rude and disrespectful. I did get defensive and it didn’t help that I was already pissed at some other stuff irl.

Just a note that I’ve never even heard of manhattan’s poet’s house until now, but it sounds fancy. Congrats if you’ve gotten in, and if you haven’t then simply props to you for opening my mind a bit.",t3_k6jm13
gezdmv4,t1_geycw9b,"No problem at all! Writers are supposed to be emotional. Thank you for having an open mind. 

We all get pissed off—but I love this sub because it’s where writers seem kind to each other: they aren’t always outside of here, ha ha",t3_k6jm13
