gems3u8,t3_k6ib1h,"I know there’s prob no meaning in this but what if its the first word of every pragraph? What if its “you I trust” which prob has no meaning and is coincidental.

gem3lzg,t1_gelupg7,"There are so many evil weirdos here who like to trick others into trusting them, just so they can have themselves another kill. I think you're better off leaving.

...that reminds me, why do they want to kill, all the time? Are they hungry? Or, do they have a vile, sadistic urge from within?

Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll always be a cliche reason. I don't care if they need to kill, in order to survive- that means their lives are essentially overused tropes.",t3_k6ib1h

gem2vhl,t1_gel6qiy,"I think most of the stories on here are usually from the perspective of the villain, whether they be a crazed murderer or an evil monster.
