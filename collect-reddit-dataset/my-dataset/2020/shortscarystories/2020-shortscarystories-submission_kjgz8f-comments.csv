ggz7aon,t3_kjgz8f,"To address the reader’s concerns, you could simply add a phrase or sentence of description in the first paragraph, to the effect: “... the man I had waited untold childhood Christmas Eves to meet, but somehow always missed; my hero, my lifelong search...” something shorter, maybe —to indicate Santa is BIG in this person’s life. 

This would go a long way toward explaining why his “yes” is so automatic.",t3_kjgz8f
ggwvzuh,t3_kjgz8f,"while the concept behind Santa’s power is fantastically scary, the eagerness behind main character’s decision to take up the mantle feels a bit off to me and lessens the impact this story should have had. we have nothing to base on as for why he decided to let this job be passed onto him. was it because he has always liked to be Santa? was it pity for the poor man? was Santa deliberately putting a spell on him? the most i can infer is that MC considered 100 years to be very long but not long enough to be insufferable.

was we supposed to project ourselves onto MC? because i would agree with the deal out of pity and compassion, i sympathise with the frustration of having to repeatedly do one thing for a century and it just so happens that i can end Santa’s suffering right then and there. but is it the motivation behind MC? he’s too enthusiastic about it",t3_kjgz8f
ggws6uh,t3_kjgz8f,"Oh, I liked this one very much. Time stretching out is so frightening to imagine! Also, *the man formerly known as Santa Claus* is a great line.",t3_kjgz8f

ggz9zhw,t1_ggz7aon,Yea thats what I thought.....santa is a big deal to op,t3_kjgz8f
ggxtmp1,t1_ggwvzuh,"I too found the main character's decision making odd. I stopped reading and said ""why?"" My question wasn't answered. Didn't find this to be scary, just baffling.",t3_kjgz8f
