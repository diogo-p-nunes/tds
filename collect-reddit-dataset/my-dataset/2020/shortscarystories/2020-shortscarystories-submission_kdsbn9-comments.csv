gfz0aet,t3_kdsbn9,"This is fantastic! I love how you cleverly highlight the parallels between the irony of immortal cancer cells leading themselves to their own demise in an organism, and immortal humans having a similar drawback.",t3_kdsbn9
gfyc5xb,t3_kdsbn9,holy crap this is good,t3_kdsbn9
gfyo2f8,t3_kdsbn9,Beautiful. Apoptosis is such a fascinating and scary subject in it's own right.,t3_kdsbn9
gfyi9u0,t3_kdsbn9,"I'm not rooting for it to happen, but heck that's a good punishment",t3_kdsbn9
gfz5myk,t3_kdsbn9,Have you watched Death Becomes Her lately?,t3_kdsbn9
gfyijo6,t3_kdsbn9,[deleted],t3_kdsbn9
gfyrjk0,t3_kdsbn9,"Amazing!! Really quite freaky. Luckily I'll be one who gets to die, haha.",t3_kdsbn9
gfz67dl,t3_kdsbn9,"Reminds me of the movie “Death Becomes Her” 

Great story!",t3_kdsbn9
gfymuuv,t3_kdsbn9,Love it!,t3_kdsbn9
gfytk1n,t3_kdsbn9,Laughs in poor.,t3_kdsbn9
gfz79bw,t3_kdsbn9,"This is a really small critique, and one I feel guilty in even mentioning because the story is so good. 

But scientists don’t jack up prices. 

I’m only pointing this out bc in the face of public distrust in science and mounting healthcare costs, it seems irresponsible not to correct. 

Scientists do science. Sometimes that science is biased, not correctly peer reviewed, or funded by an agenda, leading to results that don’t portray the full truth, but they don’t put a price on their work. That’s the job of the pharmaceutical companies and lawmakers.",t3_kdsbn9
gfz7hb7,t3_kdsbn9,Eat the rich amirite,t3_kdsbn9
gfzhpeq,t3_kdsbn9,"Somewhere along the middle it got scarely sad but then the twist came

#I LOVED THE ENDING",t3_kdsbn9
gfz3a5g,t3_kdsbn9,Throw in a little more brimstone and that sounds like a literal hell.,t3_kdsbn9
gfz41he,t3_kdsbn9,So good I had to save it!,t3_kdsbn9
gg02n4s,t3_kdsbn9,"Wouldn’t they run out of blood cells from the wounds and thus stopping the bleeding? So therefore they won’t bleed indefinitely, right?",t3_kdsbn9
gg08aex,t3_kdsbn9,Wouldn’t they just bleed to death?,t3_kdsbn9
gfys4va,t3_kdsbn9,Is this fiction or confession from a time traveler?,t3_kdsbn9
gfzyfsf,t3_kdsbn9,"Yoooo this is probably one of the best science based stories I’ve read in a looong time! At first I thought it would have something to do with how the brain couldn’t really develope properly, but it turned out even better!",t3_kdsbn9
gfyrmd6,t3_kdsbn9,This was really good!,t3_kdsbn9
gg02wux,t3_kdsbn9,Reminds me of the incomplete Shaod from Elantris.,t3_kdsbn9
gg0yd64,t3_kdsbn9,"That was really good. I wasn't expecting that to be the direction it took, and I love it when a writer surprises me",t3_kdsbn9
gg1bu8i,t3_kdsbn9,"I genuinely loved this, it was scientific logical and a really interesting read. Hell I even learned something, which is always pretty great.",t3_kdsbn9
gfz3r6f,t3_kdsbn9,i really want this to happen irl,t3_kdsbn9
gsw8rtk,t3_kdsbn9,Nice one,t3_kdsbn9
gfysw66,t3_kdsbn9,A plus story!,t3_kdsbn9
gfyztcc,t3_kdsbn9,Incredible story!!!,t3_kdsbn9
gg0hy5b,t3_kdsbn9,"this is so... wonderful, the bittersweet ending is perfect.",t3_kdsbn9
gg0pawj,t3_kdsbn9,Wow! One of the best I read here. Better than most Black Mirror episodes,t3_kdsbn9
gg0zq6e,t3_kdsbn9,I see you been on the monkeys paw. This was really good.  I wish there was a longer version.,t3_kdsbn9
gg3eerx,t3_kdsbn9,Just wow,t3_kdsbn9
gfz023z,t3_kdsbn9,Oh yes,t3_kdsbn9
gfz5cuv,t3_kdsbn9,Wow. Just...wow,t3_kdsbn9
gfz6hwu,t3_kdsbn9,Wow this is so good.,t3_kdsbn9
gfzao9e,t3_kdsbn9,"Oh wow, I love this so much. The way it evolved is just perfect. Good job!",t3_kdsbn9
gfzhfo8,t3_kdsbn9,"Just last night I was thinking ""Hey, maybe I should write a horror story titled apoptosis"". I would really appreciate it if you got out of my mind now, thank you.",t3_kdsbn9
gfzjb83,t3_kdsbn9,"lol 

haha yes elite go scream scream",t3_kdsbn9
gg0bhwe,t3_kdsbn9,"Goddamn, which rich man hurt you?",t3_kdsbn9
gg0csc2,t3_kdsbn9,Bro I feel like I just watched some mystery show with all these complicated sentences and words,t3_kdsbn9
gg0nj2k,t3_kdsbn9,This was satisfying. Very satisfying.,t3_kdsbn9
gfzocot,t3_kdsbn9,"Is this supposed to be science fiction or a representation of what you believe to be factual? I think it's a fun story since there is some truth to it, I just can't tell if this is supposed to be serious or not because of the blend of things that just aren't factual in there or yet to be fact. 

You also didn't really evaluate the shortening of DNA, for instance, or how hormones change over time, how disease can be triggered by what we eat, etc. But again, not trying to diss if it was just supposed to be a fun story, I just wouldn't go off making a youtube channel of some elitism conspiracy. There's never been a cure for death.",t3_kdsbn9
gg12100,t3_kdsbn9,"Dang, i just read about immortal jellyfish yesterday. Great story!",t3_kdsbn9
gg1cmj7,t3_kdsbn9,woah.,t3_kdsbn9
gg5ppfs,t3_kdsbn9,This should be a book. Please.,t3_kdsbn9
gg92vis,t3_kdsbn9,"Well stopping apoptosis might allow the damaged DNA to be transcribed and translated to abnormal proteins, proteins that might be not useful at all. Might even lead to their accumulation in cells.this accumulation might finally lead to stress on cell. Even if apoptosis is not happening Its likely necrosis will occur",t3_kdsbn9
gfzc9kg,t3_kdsbn9,damn,t3_kdsbn9
gfzi4nr,t3_kdsbn9,"this is perfect, man. Great work.",t3_kdsbn9

gfzlg2i,t3_kdsbn9,interesting story!,t3_kdsbn9
gfznl91,t3_kdsbn9,OOooh very good story,t3_kdsbn9
gfzwkro,t3_kdsbn9,"This is amazing!

I would legit read a book on this.

A dystopian fiction based on immortality, with a catch.

A person born centuries later, to find a way to free their people from the curse",t3_kdsbn9
gg0ae5d,t3_kdsbn9,This was amazing! It’s funny because I just took a biology final and this gave severe whiplash at first.,t3_kdsbn9
gg0xgh5,t3_kdsbn9,holy cow i have a background in bio and this was such an amazing read!!! so well written!!!,t3_kdsbn9
gfzlzxq,t3_kdsbn9,"i mean, apoptosis isn't the cause for all death",t3_kdsbn9
gg0himb,t3_kdsbn9,Wow. Loved it!,t3_kdsbn9
gg0iahz,t3_kdsbn9,Nice,t3_kdsbn9
gg0hvh6,t3_kdsbn9,This needs to be a Hollywood movie,t3_kdsbn9
gfz10d2,t1_gfz0aet,"I find that topic fascinating, in animal physiology lecture i thought it was an interesting mechanism but I was too dumb to dissect it to the level I want to know haha.",t3_kdsbn9
gfydpqs,t1_gfyc5xb,Not gonna lie I'm def rooting for it to happen,t3_kdsbn9
gfz61th,t1_gfz5myk,"I have not, what is that?",t3_kdsbn9
gg0674q,t1_gfz5myk,Ha came looking for this comment,t3_kdsbn9

gfyrykw,t1_gfyrjk0,"Working in healthcare in 2020, thats been my mood all year haha",t3_kdsbn9
gfz6wh0,t1_gfz67dl,"Someone else mentioned that but I've never heard of it, I'll have to look it up",t3_kdsbn9
gfz7rao,t1_gfz79bw,"Yeah you're right, I'd edit it for clarification, but I think I'm already close enough to 500 words where it'd be a pain.

You could envision it as them doing it specifically to target the rich people once they realise the drawbacks, but that's also too long to convey I think.

Either way good note. I edit all my stories based on feedback so one day I can (hopefully) get them published, so I'll add that to the final draft of this one :)",t3_kdsbn9
gfzvgwl,t1_gfz7hb7,"They're going to be the only food left!

They'll probably be all stringy and gamey thought.",t3_kdsbn9

gfzqyp7,t1_gfzocot,[deleted],t3_kdsbn9
gfzpaaz,t1_gfzocot,"I mean it's supposed to be exaggerated science fiction, I know that apotosis isn't the sole reason we die. It just plays a role in aging and such.

And I couldn't really evaluate all that in less than 500 words.",t3_kdsbn9
gg6rx7z,t1_gg5ppfs,r/CouldBeABook is an up and coming sub,t3_kdsbn9
gg9ql12,t1_gg92vis,"You're right but shhhhh, just enjoy the ride :)",t3_kdsbn9

gfznwc8,t1_gfzlzxq,Yeah sometimes you get stabbed,t3_kdsbn9
gfz1lbf,t1_gfz10d2,Well you clearly did a good job in regards to the story! And I’m sure you aren’t too dumb at all! Give it another go! :),t3_kdsbn9
gg1jo00,t1_gfydpqs,"Sadly simply stopping the two processes of apoptosis and mitosis doesn’t prevent death, great story though!",t3_kdsbn9
gfzoo71,t1_gfz61th,"It's an older movie with Maryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, and Bruce Willis about a potion that makes it where you can never die. It's a bit of a comedy.",t3_kdsbn9
gg04ubx,t1_gfyrykw,Thank you for your service.,t3_kdsbn9
gg1a81l,t1_gfyrykw,"That context adds so much more to this story. Thank you for all you and your colleagues are doing, I cannot even image how tough it must be!",t3_kdsbn9
gfz8ohj,t1_gfz6wh0,"Definitely check it out - it’s an excellent black comedy starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. The premise is a very similar idea to this, only without the climate change angle!",t3_kdsbn9
gfz8430,t1_gfz7rao,totally understandable! just wanted to make a note.,t3_kdsbn9
gg04yeq,t1_gfzvgwl,"I dunno, I reckon all that exercise and dieting to stay 'beautiful' might make them pretty tasty.",t3_kdsbn9
gfysbfl,t1_gfysalk,[deleted],t3_kdsbn9
gfzr106,t1_gfzqyp7,Haha oh hallelujah.,t3_kdsbn9
gfzrb1r,t1_gfzpaaz,"I thought it was entertaining, most people don't even know what that word means. Artificial sweeteners can cause apoptosis, and aspartame in particular is an ingredient that they use to feed immortal tumor cell lines. Thank you for putting in the time to create this.",t3_kdsbn9
