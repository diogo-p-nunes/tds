This one is dedicated to one of my fave peeps - u/newtotownJAM because she‚Äôs so awesome.

gl063hm,t3_k9pj9z,"Listen, if I go full mental, I'ma end up doing this. 
My mom has ptsd from being raped and abused by my uncle in law. My mom's family didn't believe her. (She was adopted, so no incest.) This happened for so long until she broke. So, years and years later, now that's she's an adult, she doesn't take her meds, or go to the therapy. When she ''snaps'' she becomes a soulless husk of a human being. She stops eating, so she looks skinny. She just stay in her trailer, sometimes leaving. When I was a kid, I said I was sick and in the restroom. The next day, and I was sleeping on the couch. She didn't let me get up. I wonder sneakily placed a note on her bed, but she noticed me. She screamed. Her face at that moment haunts me to this day. At the moment her ptsd is acting up. I wish she didn't do this. Last time it happened it took three years. Three fucking goddamn years.

My dad, he was okay. He used to be a drug addict, but he got his shit together when he knew I was being born. I'm proud.

Fuck you Tina. Get help.",t3_k9pj9z
