ggu7jqa,t3_khlfvh,"Wait, Santa left you coal for being naughty??  Why the hell did I get a severed goat head?",t3_khlfvh
ggwxe1d,t3_khlfvh,"Wait, is the 24 hour period for the throwaway the same as my actual account?",t3_khlfvh

gh0ft5b,t1_gh0csvj,New one each contest. I want this to be as anonymous as possible so everyone has a chance at winning.,t3_khlfvh
