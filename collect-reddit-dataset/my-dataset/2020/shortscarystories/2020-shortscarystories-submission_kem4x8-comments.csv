gg3zo8d,t1_gg3mb6y,"A lot of them are structured basically the same, with a twist at the end you see coming a mile away. Nothing wrong with that per se, but a story written relying on the last sentence to add a punch just gets done way too often.",t3_kem4x8
gg7cfrb,t1_gg3zo8d,"NTM the numerous rules stories. I know some people like them, but I really don't.  Just seems like an exercise a teacher would give you in creative writing, that people do when they don't have any good ideas. Ritual stories are a close second in my opinion.  Both types of stories I just skip entirely as soon as I realize what they are. I read the first 50 of them or so that I came across and there wasn't anything new or exciting in any of them. Sorry, now I'm ranting. I try to only say positive things about stories I like and leave the criticism to people who write themselves. So I guess this has been building awhile.",t3_kem4x8
