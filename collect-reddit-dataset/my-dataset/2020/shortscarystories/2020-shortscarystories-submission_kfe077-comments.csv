ggdkkik,t3_kfe077,Sounds a bit like divergent.  But still a cool premise,t3_kfe077

ggdldwn,t1_ggdkkik,"Ooh Divergent has serious religious undertones. Not what my aim was. I was going for like, the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror. Someone telling you about a special kind of hell they designed. Then you find out it's for you. I know hell is a religious concept, but still. Thanks.",t3_kfe077
gg8jkys,t1_gg8jbj7,"Aw really? Sorry this was my first try. I guess it made sense in my head. 

His friend called him back over. To tell him hes fixin to die.
 
Just by checking his watch, phone, and the doorknob. It was determined he was deemed inherently evil",t3_kfe077
ggauoom,t1_ggatw4x,Damn right I am.,t3_kfe077
ggdlm1b,t1_ggdldwn,Oh that special hell sounds a bit like The Good Place. Only less funny ha ha.,t3_kfe077
gg8jq8m,t1_gg8jkys,"Whats fixin to die?

Its not about the story being nonsensical that I can’t understand it, I’m just not a native speaker :)",t3_kfe077
ggdlwot,t1_ggdlm1b,Exactly,t3_kfe077
gg8k3c3,t1_gg8jq8m,"Scientists and doctors formulate a test. Like a perfect test. To determine whether or not people are evil. Even if they haven't been evil yet. A simple pattern that all the evil people in the world would eventually do. Nobody knows the pattern. But good people wont do it. How do you know your not actually a violent soul? What if one day you did something, and every one around sits you down, to tell you it's ok. Your about to die. But it's ok. Dont be scared.",t3_kfe077
