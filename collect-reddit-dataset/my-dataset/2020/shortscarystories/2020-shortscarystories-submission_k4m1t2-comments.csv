ge9xvx9,t3_k4m1t2,up until the third paragraph I thought this was r/relationship_advice and was about to call you an idiot for asking reddit for advice despite knowing that was the entire problem,t3_k4m1t2
ge9yf6a,t3_k4m1t2,"OP, you are NTA, your wife does not validate your feelings and gaslights you. 

I'd divorce her if I were you, good luck!",t3_k4m1t2
ge9xo9r,t3_k4m1t2,"Am I the only one who thinks this isn't that well written? The author has very creative ideas but their written style is messy and they start half of their posts with ""hey guys"", and they still get so many upvotes. Correct me if I'm wrong",t3_k4m1t2
geag2gz,t3_k4m1t2,"Tbh I think this would have been scarier without a supernatural component. If you said you started asking Reddit for big decisions and then eventually you realized you were unable to solve any disagreement yourself (e.g., need to ask Reddit about which toothpaste you should buy since she likes crest and you like Colgate), that would be scarier to me.",t3_k4m1t2
ge9xkjy,t3_k4m1t2,You have my support.,t3_k4m1t2
ge9we64,t3_k4m1t2,play stupid games win stupid prizes :/,t3_k4m1t2
gearscw,t3_k4m1t2,"Personally, I think you both have good points.  Maybe you could let your wife stab you somewhere non-vital.  Once you've done that for her, see if she'll compromise on some of the things you want.",t3_k4m1t2
ge9xopr,t3_k4m1t2,Here you dropped these 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩,t3_k4m1t2
ge9vts3,t3_k4m1t2,NTA your house your rules,t3_k4m1t2
ge9yati,t3_k4m1t2,Your wife is right. you should just let her kill you 🙄 stop being so controlling. YTA red flags everywhere!!!,t3_k4m1t2
gea1jqi,t3_k4m1t2,Sounds like it's time to set boundaries with Reddit. You might even have to go NC.,t3_k4m1t2
ge9xrf9,t3_k4m1t2,You dropped this 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩,t3_k4m1t2
gea4ym2,t3_k4m1t2,I never remember what subreddit im on. Damn that messed with me,t3_k4m1t2
geawh2x,t3_k4m1t2,"This is just weird, not really scary.",t3_k4m1t2
gec72ba,t3_k4m1t2,"Execution was kind of lacking... but I will give you points for the creativity, can't say I would ever think of that setup",t3_k4m1t2
geakd8f,t3_k4m1t2,We gotchu bro. Someone get this man an award,t3_k4m1t2
gec3xpl,t3_k4m1t2,Writing is a bit lazy. Doesn't seem well thought out. And gaining powers doesn't make sense. Not a fan sorry.,t3_k4m1t2
gec3geb,t3_k4m1t2,I forgot what sub I was on for a few good seconds,t3_k4m1t2
geww006,t3_k4m1t2,DO A BARREL ROLL,t3_k4m1t2
gec03ro,t3_k4m1t2,I liked the story but you could’ve done a lot more with it. I think if you took another draft and added a few hundred words then it could do well in scary stories sub. Super creative ideas!!,t3_k4m1t2
geacn7o,t3_k4m1t2,"Well, someone had to do it:

Have my support!",t3_k4m1t2
geac9hk,t3_k4m1t2,You heave my support and admiration for staying with her through it all,t3_k4m1t2
geb4wcf,t3_k4m1t2,I think you're in too deep on this  website.,t3_k4m1t2
geb5iet,t3_k4m1t2,the best thing about this was watching the upvotes go up as i read,t3_k4m1t2
geb5iqe,t3_k4m1t2,"NTA. Just because she's saying it nicely doesn't mean it's nice!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

haha",t3_k4m1t2
geboqp3,t3_k4m1t2,Easy. Make fake accounts and gain followers of your own that way. Make her realize she's wrong and boom. You're out.,t3_k4m1t2
gecq986,t3_k4m1t2,"NTA wife is definitely in the wrong here, seek therapy.",t3_k4m1t2
gejn8pw,t3_k4m1t2,"Ready for maximum power?

Your wife is a stupid dumb-dumb that is mean and you are the big smart brain in the realtion ship!

Go Op!

Go Op!",t3_k4m1t2
gebw7sj,t3_k4m1t2,YTA. Don't be so self centered.,t3_k4m1t2
geas5b0,t1_ge9xvx9,Lmfao same i-,t3_k4m1t2
gebd7yl,t1_ge9xo9r,"I felt that too. Initially I scrolled past this story on the second paragraph because the setup was lazy. Just basically opening up with ""and then we started getting powers..."" was a turn-off for my brain. 

OP, if you do read this, your idea is creative. But a little more setup, detail, and suspense would make your story more engaging.

 Listing specific instances of fights you had, and the slow development of the powers as things progressed would build much more suspense, add mystery, and engage the reader. 

This is r/ShortScaryStories, so I understand wanting to keep it brief. But even one or two more paragraphs of setup would slow the development of your story and make it more entertaining to read. Listing specific instances instead of the gist of the situation is a surefire way to get some juicy details in as well as some nice lead-up to your climax. 

This whole critique is the embodiment of ""show, don't tell"". The golden rule of writing! It would be lovely to see a second draft of your story with more detail and a few fleshed-out plot points which build your narrative from the ground up. A bit more  backstory about your marriage and how you reached this point. And finally, it would be great to see how you can tell this story not to a whole audience of strangers, but to one invisible entity who is engaged and thirsty for all the details. You're not writing for a crowd, you're writing to an individual. 

Good luck and I hope you post more. :)",t3_k4m1t2
ge9yevp,t1_ge9xo9r,I agree. It feels like a rough draft. Maybe they want to just put their ideas out there and get feedback before spending their time on fine tuning?,t3_k4m1t2
geactjd,t1_ge9xo9r,"Its the wife's supporters. Quick, say he's right so he gains power.",t3_k4m1t2
geagbak,t1_ge9xo9r,Hey lay off he says he has bad grammar and struggles to explain things. He’s trying his best.  /s,t3_k4m1t2
gebd9hn,t1_ge9xo9r,I agree with you. I've read a few of this author's stories but they are definitely quantity over quality. I wish they wouldn't post so many low-quality stories without fleshing them out or improving the writing.,t3_k4m1t2
ge9zl8k,t1_ge9xo9r,Isn't that the point though? It's supposed to read like a typical Reddit post,t3_k4m1t2
ge9yxu1,t1_ge9xo9r,"I smell a r/Karmafarma



edit: didn’t think this was a real subreddit, thought I just came up w/ the phrase as I typed it. Nothing is original anymore.",t3_k4m1t2
gealv36,t1_ge9xo9r,I agree but the author is suppose to be the lesser reddit user in his marriage. I kinda like that it was written like this,t3_k4m1t2
gea5qb8,t1_ge9xo9r,I’ve read plenty of stories on this subreddit with this style. It doesn’t bother me.,t3_k4m1t2
geaj2fn,t1_ge9xo9r,I agree. Didn’t like this story,t3_k4m1t2
geash99,t1_ge9xo9r,"yea but that's like, part of the point. 

I too hated it at first but then when he pointed it out I was like ""whoah, clever""",t3_k4m1t2
geb5dmv,t1_ge9xo9r,"I think it is intentional (or at least excused), since OP wrote that losing control made him worse at writing",t3_k4m1t2
geawv2c,t1_ge9xo9r,I think it’s meant to be written in the style of a simple Reddit post. They don’t want it to sound pretentious,t3_k4m1t2
gg0mewt,t1_ge9xo9r,I thought we're supposed to really only reply with constructive criticism and not general dislike or is that only no sleep.,t3_k4m1t2
geb0f6y,t1_gearscw,"This is the only reasonable comment so far. OP, you got the perfect solution right here. Stop whining.",t3_k4m1t2
geb5jyf,t1_ge9vts3,Play stupid games win stupid powerups,t3_k4m1t2
geaslp3,t1_ge9vts3,who says it's OP's house why can't it be the wife's.,t3_k4m1t2
geahv5q,t1_geacn7o,no one had to do it,t3_k4m1t2
geclhxx,t1_gebd7yl,kinda agreed. the power thing came in from nowhere and it kinda seems like a childish idea imo. don’t want to seem rude but it doesn’t seem that creative to come up with an idea that “reddit upvotes = power”.,t3_k4m1t2
gecsumn,t1_ge9yevp,"i also had this complaint but then i started feeling it was part of the story, like how the husband has bad grammer and can't explain his self, and it's being reflected on the post or something",t3_k4m1t2
ge9zyhj,t1_ge9zl8k,"The pacing is off, even for a reddit post. Most of the stuff on /r/relationships is better written than this.",t3_k4m1t2
geaqzj1,t1_ge9yxu1,/r/ofcoursethatsathing,t3_k4m1t2
gebnn7h,t1_geaslp3,Reddit's casual misogyny strikes again 🙄,t3_k4m1t2
geacvy0,t1_ge9zyhj,"I did feel that the suspense was a bit lacking. OP kinda gave it away with the whole giving powers thing. I did think it was an interesting commentary on how judgemental and hasty Reddit can be, just needs to be brought up a little differently.",t3_k4m1t2
