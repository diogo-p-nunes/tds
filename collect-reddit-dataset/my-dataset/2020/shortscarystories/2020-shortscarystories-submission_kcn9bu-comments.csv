By the way, what does “Access Deny” refer to?

*That* was about 2 hours ago and I haven’t responded, Cause I am personally close to that Katie Flakes.
Cause she is my mother.
This scared me for so many *reasons*, like first off who hates my mother so bad that they *sent* a hit man on her?
But I guess this was bound to happen. Being *hired* to kill someone that I am close to, but I never *expected* it would be would mother.
So I went to my *mother’s* house to make sure that she is safe and sound, but when I got *there* it wasn’t what I *expected*.
She was holding a gun *to* her head and she was crying.
Mother: Bryan what are you doing here??!
Me: Mom what are you doing??
Mother: I am so sorry, I try to be a good mother but I can’t do it anymore. I try to ask someone else to do the job for me by hiring a hitman on myself but I just can’t wait anymore.
Me: Wait.. It was you?? You were the one who *hired* the hit??
By the way I haven’t told her I was a hitman so we were both *shocked*, but it only made things worse.
And apparently she was so shook up that she was shaking more, So bad that the gun trigger has been *pulled*...
I can’t help *but* think that this is *all my* fault, and knowing that my mother is hurting so much *because* I didn’t even notice, or to ask, made it *much* worse.
That was my last and final hit on anyone, but having her blood stain on my shirt really *was* the last straw. (to draw straws is a totally different thing)",t3_kcn9bu

gfrz23v,t1_gfrykrl,The access Deny mean like they can’t give away the name. Now saying doesn’t really make sense since they say personal information about themselves,t3_kcn9bu
