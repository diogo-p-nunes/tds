gfubtqd,t3_kd40ft,Holy shit its so good but i just hated reading every second after they said that someone was putting bleach in people. The realization,t3_kd40ft
gfvdsta,t3_kd40ft,"I didn't notice the sub and was halfway through the story thinking it was someone warning us for how horrible it is to be on the IC with covid, which made the beginning of the story even more horrifying to read. The rest made me physically ill. It's so good, I read it twice!",t3_kd40ft
gfuj3ms,t3_kd40ft,Oh...my...God! Horrifying!,t3_kd40ft
gfwjl41,t3_kd40ft,My urethra is shrieking in pain.,t3_kd40ft
gfzufy5,t3_kd40ft,I don’t have a penis and I could still literally feel the second half of this story,t3_kd40ft
gfvceex,t3_kd40ft,"AH. HOW AWFUL. 

Good scary story, though.",t3_kd40ft
gg1ylji,t3_kd40ft,"Oh good god wooow! Your pain descriptions were just incredible, like I started squeezing my legs together! You just made it so easy to visualize that it made me squeamish. This was excellent.",t3_kd40ft
gfz7yy8,t3_kd40ft,gj dude this is amazing,t3_kd40ft
gg4c0vq,t3_kd40ft,"Ugh, this was so painfully visceral before you even revealed the bleach. So sadistic and invasive.    Although, as gross as this is, I kind of appreciate that you just kept going with it. I think a lot of writers would've just ended right after the nurse reveals the twist.",t3_kd40ft
gfxk82d,t3_kd40ft,"Lol I knew something was up when it was the CNA putting in a cath. That would not happen, that is the job of a registered nurse.",t3_kd40ft
gfucs3a,t1_gfubtqd,"I work in a hospital lab and thought ""hmm what's the origin of the worst sample we could get""

Bloody bleach catheter tip it was",t3_kd40ft
gfwsk54,t1_gfwjl41,Hahaha so well said,t3_kd40ft
gfzv6ef,t1_gfzufy5,Thats a good sign for me than if I can write it in a way that everyone can feel it haha,t3_kd40ft
gg4c9ch,t1_gg4c0vq,"Ehhhh life goes on after twists, plus it helps the reader relate to the narrator if they get to react to it",t3_kd40ft
gfxphmr,t1_gfxk82d,I was a cna for awhile and we def learned how to put catheters in and out,t3_kd40ft
gfucw5q,t1_gfucs3a,Jesus fuck im still like shivering thats such a good one. Its like thinking abt getting a papercut across ur dicktip lol,t3_kd40ft
gg4cfmz,t1_gg4c9ch,"Agreed. Some stories can end on a twist alright fb t, but something like this with body horror, you really need the protagonist to see/feel it all. (Poor guy)",t3_kd40ft
gfxsezs,t1_gfxphmr,"Really? I mean I guess regulations in every place is different.   In my province that is something we are not trained to do, and it is outside of our scope of practice. We aren’t even allowed to give someone their insulin, unless delegated by a nurse in a home are setting. But long term care, the registered staff are the only ones allowed to do it.",t3_kd40ft
gg4cqh1,t1_gg4cfmz,Plus it doubles as a reminder to wear a mask haha. This is the worst case,t3_kd40ft
gfxsrkw,t1_gfxsezs,Yeah I guess it depends on location. I learned how to in theory but never did it in practice I guess,t3_kd40ft
