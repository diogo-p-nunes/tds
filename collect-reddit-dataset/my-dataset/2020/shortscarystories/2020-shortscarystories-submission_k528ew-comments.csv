gecgo60,t3_k528ew,Something more scary than being taken by aliens is them telling you they want to see your insides while they take you.,t3_k528ew
gecgd5d,t3_k528ew,"This is so good! Your writing is very concise, while also being very melodic. Super good job",t3_k528ew
gecd6jv,t3_k528ew,"If you're interested in checking out some of my other writing, I'd love to see you over at [WestCoastDerry](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestCoastDerry/), my author page! And if anyone can tell me why the link doesn't work on mobile I'll write a horror story of your choosing :)",t3_k528ew
gec8xbs,t3_k528ew,Damn chills,t3_k528ew
geczrkh,t3_k528ew,"I enjoy your writing style, so alive! And I also hope ""it ended quickly"" for Riley <3",t3_k528ew
ged6t0t,t3_k528ew,"That was so good Cal, your writing style beggars belief. I look forward to your work so much, thank you for that piece of wonderment every single day. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§",t3_k528ew
gedvawc,t3_k528ew,"I mean, they could've just meant to give her an MRI?",t3_k528ew
ged28a9,t3_k528ew,Great story!,t3_k528ew
ged67ig,t3_k528ew,Idiot aliens could have just gone to the morgue if they wanted to see insides.,t3_k528ew

geci6uu,t1_gecgo60,"Haha my thoughts exactly. These dudes did not come in peace, only for science experiments.",t3_k528ew
geci5gv,t1_gecgd5d,"Music to my ears! Iâ€™m loving the challenge of writing for this subreddit. I still want to tell stories with characters people connect to, settings that feel real, etc...but <500 words forces you to get straight to the point which is a really useful exercise for me personally.",t3_k528ew
geck5jg,t1_gecd6jv,"It works on mobile for me, maybe it doesnâ€™t work on non apple mobile devices?",t3_k528ew
ged0knf,t1_gecd6jv,It works on my android phone. Maybe sunspots? Or a bug that the devs have since fixed? Or the devices don't have enough memory/ processing (my older phones have had issues with loading newer things)? Or maybe the aliens don't want you to have fun?,t3_k528ew
geecwde,t1_gecd6jv,"It works for me! Loved the story, btw",t3_k528ew

geckdde,t1_geck5jg,"Interesting, itâ€™s working for me now too. Maybe I was just messing up the URL last time I posted it ðŸ˜‚Iâ€™ll still write a short horror story of your choosing since you responded, but no pressure. ðŸ™Œ",t3_k528ew
gedvx1g,t1_ged0knf,"Iâ€™m glad things are working, so strange that they werenâ€™t before! Def aliens. Well hey, if you have a story request, message me a genre or a basic idea and Iâ€™ll dedicate it to you. Thanks for looking out! (No pressure to do the aforementioned, just wanted to offer)",t3_k528ew
gedw755,t1_gedvp7h,Plot twist: they gave her an MRI without knowing she had metal implants in her spine...,t3_k528ew

gg10zod,t1_gg0ndkk,yeah trying to get the sub started as well as complementing some good works,t3_k528ew
gedy0h7,t1_gedwvtt,Then they reconstruct her body using their superior tech. But something isn't quite right with her after coming back to life...,t3_k528ew
gedygno,t1_gedy0h7,"So Riley Fletcher just becomes this soulless abomination and ultimately, the villain. Like a modern take on Frankenstein. I love how this could go in two directions: horror or comedy (has some Rick and Morty undertones). Very complimentary genres.",t3_k528ew
gedyhza,t1_gedygno,"Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

gedz61f,t1_gedygno,Oh she's definitely the villain. But is she still Riley? Only part of her. A part that watches with a mixture of horror and joy as she rips the aliens apart one by one...,t3_k528ew
