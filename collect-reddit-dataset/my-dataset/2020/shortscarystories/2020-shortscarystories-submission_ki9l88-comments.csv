ggpqxc2,t3_ki9l88,">At the market, two women mention slime washing up onshore. I thank them for the heads up. Along the coast, a man points out rainbow-colored sparkles on the horizon. I nod. 

I live by the shore and will keep a lookout over the ocean in case any of the signs pop up. Thanks for the warning.",t3_ki9l88
ggqz3rg,t3_ki9l88,"Great story and what an ending!
Also, title made me chuckle as I have a genetic condition that makes my joins very flexible and prone to dislocation, my fianc√© affectionately calls me ""my boneless one "". So I spent the story picturing myself, crutches in hand, hobbling out of the sea.",t3_ki9l88

gic4ius,t3_ki9l88,The best thing about this story for me is that the monster is not the antagonist and yet it's quite menacing.  I appreciate how you never allude to the appearance or physical nature of the boneless one because it's completely unneeded and would be less effective I think.  I felt suspense in not knowing what it does to people or how.,t3_ki9l88
