gh84bjb,t3_klc4zm,Can you explain what's going on? I don't get it.,t3_klc4zm
gh82fhh,t3_klc4zm,I know it's cheesy but it's my first post here so be kind ðŸ˜¥,t3_klc4zm
ghagxn1,t3_klc4zm,"Loved this! Especially the mysterious of the man. Love the details of him being too tall for the balcony, and the strange smile on the second sighting. Very subtly ominous. Great job.",t3_klc4zm
ghb8241,t3_klc4zm,Very nice story. You did a great job. I enjoy how the ending didn't have to have a descriptive account.,t3_klc4zm
gh9drf4,t3_klc4zm,I loved this!! Super good twist!,t3_klc4zm
gh9nz7q,t3_klc4zm,"Nice! Great dead, nice and suspenseful. Don't see much stories written from a young POV these days.",t3_klc4zm
ghd6okf,t3_klc4zm,"Nicely done, this gave me chills.",t3_klc4zm
gh84ul9,t1_gh84bjb,"ahh I'm sorry ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'll try my best!

basically main character is a little girl with an adventurous spirit. she is told not to go to the balcony, she goes anyway because it's sunny out. she sees a tall man acting weird. she goes back, mom finds out, freaks out, closes all curtains and tells her not to go back and stuff. she goes anyways, sees tall man again, he's acting weird again. next day, girl is writing her diary from her balcony and tall man is no longer there. she notices it's not as sunny and reasons it's because of something from inside her house casting a shadow on the balcony, implying tall man is at their house. 

I'm sorry I did a poor job on showing it lol I'll try to be better on future posts!",t3_klc4zm
gh8cnbb,t1_gh82fhh,"We will be awful. 

Thatâ€™s the way audience works.

Anyway, the main problem is the choice of the subject: choosing a little girl you lost a lot of show-donâ€™t-tell, resulting on description not of action, but of boring considerations of what a little girl could write on her diary.

Focus on describing the actions, not the feelings. Let emerge feelings from the main character actions and avoid perception verbs.

Continue writing. Hope to read more soon",t3_klc4zm
gh8a313,t1_gh84ul9,"Ah, thank you. I was wondering if the tall man was blocking the sun! No worries, please don't beat yourself up by thinking you did a poor job. Just because I didn't get it doesn't mean it was bad! 

I love reading everyone's stories and I think it takes courage to post and open yourself up for possible criticism! Please keep entertaining us.",t3_klc4zm
gh9hsf6,t1_gh8cnbb,"Idk, people are fairly nice here, lol",t3_klc4zm
gh9hwn2,t1_gh8cnbb,"One workaround is to use the unreliable narrator device; from a childâ€™s POV, could easily be worked to communicate whatâ€™s really going on",t3_klc4zm
gh8cuo1,t1_gh8cnbb,"huh? I know, I just said that cause it's what everybody says 

thanks for the criticism, it's appreciated! C:",t3_klc4zm
gh8frjk,t1_gh8cuo1,Itâ€™s constructive criticism. Itâ€™s intended to have more good writers :) remember: show-donâ€™t-tell and half of the problems are gone,t3_klc4zm
