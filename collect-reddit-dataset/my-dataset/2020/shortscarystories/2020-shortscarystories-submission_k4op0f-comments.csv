I hadn't posted here in a while as life got a little busy. I think that this is different from anything that I had written before in that I tried to write less of a traditional spooky story about a monster posing some direct threat to a protagonist and more about someone becoming unhinged after a major life event. I would appreciate any constructive criticism!  


Also, I was on the fence about whether this violates Rule 6 of this subreddit. If it does, then please let me know and I'll take it down.",t3_k4op0f
