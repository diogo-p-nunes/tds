ggfd9jt,t3_kgk177,"I like the basic concept and the description too. The  ‚Äúhalf a cat‚Äù dialogue has some black-humor I really appreciate. The conclusion should be fixed, because there‚Äôs not the attempt to find an explanation. If you said: *only a dinosaur could chop a car that way, but they are extinct. Well... are they? Would we be able to detect a dinosaur that can hide so well to be invisible?*

Silly explanation, but an attempt. I hope I explain my point üòä please, continue with your stories!",t3_kgk177
