ghcdy38,t3_km37aa,"/u/Lookapool5, I have found an error in your post:

 > “mean ~~its~~ [**it's**] a dark”

I suggest that you, Lookapool5, use “mean ~~its~~ [**it's**] a dark” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

 ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!)",t3_km37aa
