gekv5kf,t3_k6f4on,There’s so much emotional weight behind “She told me that she was from Delaware.” This is fascinating!,t3_k6f4on
gekml1m,t3_k6f4on,Oooh ouch,t3_k6f4on
gell9d2,t3_k6f4on,Okay I might just be dumb but I’m not sure I get the ending—,t3_k6f4on

gepy4xj,t3_k6f4on,This was so haunting.,t3_k6f4on
gezulcl,t3_k6f4on,"Run! That creepy little girl is going to eat you, man!",t3_k6f4on
gem3deh,t1_gekv5kf,"Seconded. Great story, and this line in particular is just so heavy and emotionally devastating. Write more!",t3_k6f4on

gelofbx,t1_gell9d2,"He's hoping his daughter's at least half his, meaning she'd be at least half human.

geo5z0f,t1_gelofbx,Wait I might just be dumb. Where does it say the daughter has curls?,t3_k6f4on
geosxwi,t1_gelofbx,"I'd just like to add that at the beginning the dad talks about how he eats differently at night, and then at the end the fays' mouths are covered in blood and the daughter looks at him she wouldn't during the day.",t3_k6f4on
geocfyx,t1_geo5z0f,"Second paragraph, where it says ""raven ringlets"".",t3_k6f4on
