ggjzxr1,t3_kh8yk7,Sounds about right,t3_kh8yk7
ggk93a5,t3_kh8yk7,I love this so much. I've read another story with a similar ending (so I can't quite share what it is I suppose...) and I love the message. It's just so crazy to think of how humanity can easily turn corrupt af.,t3_kh8yk7
ggkc2ua,t3_kh8yk7,There is a very similar story in here involving a meteor. Though the tone of the ‚Äúnow you know‚Äù message did give this story an extra ‚Äúumph.‚Äù,t3_kh8yk7

ggkfnhd,t3_kh8yk7,"That was INCREDIBLE! I always thought the world being scheduled to be exploded or whatever (Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy style) with a timer and everything is a particularly terrifying and disturbing concept. I was hoping there would be a twist at the ending and you didn‚Äôt disappoint!

ggm29iy,t3_kh8yk7,This reminds me of a dream I had once. The world was ending and me and my family were huddled in the living room together saying our final goodbyes and that we loved each other.
