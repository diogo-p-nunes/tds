gfg17u4,t1_gfdc0k8,"Girl says she has a friend named Kenny. 

Parents can't see Kenny; they think he's an imaginary friend, but they play along (pretending he is real). No one else can see Kenny. The other kids think this girl is weird when she tries to introduce Kenny, because he isn't there.

Kenny starts changing in a demon, and tries to kill the girl with his demon friends. 

Girl runs home and tells her parents that Kenny tried to kill her, and they are like, ""You mean your imaginary friend?"" 

That's when she realizes that no one else can see Kenny. That's why everyone else acted weird when she talked about Kenny. 

Kenny is not imaginary, he is a demon. The girl is the only one who can see him.",t3_kax48x
