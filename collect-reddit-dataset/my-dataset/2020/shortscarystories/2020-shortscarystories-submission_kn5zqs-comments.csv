Great story.",t3_kn5zqs
ghiitdy,t3_kn5zqs,"Today's story is inspired by the fact that cave diving is a thing that people willingly do for ""fun.""

ghivje5,t3_kn5zqs,"Well uh, at least he checked off the last thing? He can die now.",t3_kn5zqs
ghiyk7u,t3_kn5zqs,"Funnily enough, as I was looking up a disappearance case that this reminds me of, the sign for the cave involved in the incident looks VERY similar to the one described in your story!



The cave: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_Spring
(Go to the History section and you'll see a familiar sign! ðŸ˜œ) 



The disappearance of Ben McDaniel, which is what this story reminded me of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Ben_McDaniel",t3_kn5zqs
ghj2u7n,t3_kn5zqs,"Well this is a fear I never knew I had.  Maybe Calvin will be reborn as one of those pale crabs and he will be able to fully explore the caves at his leisure.  Also whoever gave this that crab flair, you are an evil genius.",t3_kn5zqs
ghj4d69,t3_kn5zqs,great job. i'm fucking terrified of cave diving and this captured nearly all of my reasons to fear it,t3_kn5zqs
ghj9crl,t3_kn5zqs,"People dont understand my fear of the sea or any large areas of water...more I read, more im right about my fears!!",t3_kn5zqs
ghj13wq,t3_kn5zqs,"I'm originally from the Eastern Shore and can confirm that crabs are indeed monstrous little creatures. That's why we eat them...before they can eat us!

Great read, thank you!",t3_kn5zqs
ghjby7s,t3_kn5zqs,Tiny crab people-teeth vs neoprene wetsuit. Heâ€™s probably fine. Until they start on his face. Then heâ€™s not so fine.,t3_kn5zqs
ghj7tzx,t3_kn5zqs,"This terrified me as I am absolutely terrified of deep water. Crabs are another thing that gets me. Amazing story, you did a great job! I do have to admit the thing that really caught my attention was that you mentioned the eastern shore of Maryland, Iâ€™m from there and never see anything about it so this was just nice for me lmao",t3_kn5zqs
ghj8si7,t3_kn5zqs,Meh he was dying anyways,t3_kn5zqs
ghj9g23,t3_kn5zqs,If you told me those caves were actually located somewhere off the coast near Crisfield I would probably believe you. Great story!,t3_kn5zqs
ghjdy6g,t3_kn5zqs,Very chilling. Nicely done. Got in and got right back out. Well Calvin didn't but ...,t3_kn5zqs
ghj819x,t3_kn5zqs,"Fuck no, this is why I donâ€™t go poking around uncharted holes! Excellent job!",t3_kn5zqs
ghk1wsz,t3_kn5zqs,One of my favourite stories I've read here. The crab gave me a shiver of disgust. Well done.,t3_kn5zqs

ghkfltr,t3_kn5zqs,"Well I should've known you were behind this story GTM! Deep underwater is a bit of a NOPE thought for me.  This totally pushed my panic button. And nope screaming in my head.  
Great job as always my friend! ðŸ’œ",t3_kn5zqs
ghl67hk,t3_kn5zqs,Sounds like you were inspired by the Ben McDaniel case! That case has always fascinated me. Cool story!,t3_kn5zqs
ghlp7z7,t3_kn5zqs,"This is based off a real disappearance case, right? I'm so intrigued by that one. I wonder where that man is",t3_kn5zqs
ghkg7ru,t3_kn5zqs,"I love this! It reminds me of one of Mr. Ballenâ€™s episodes from YouTube. Excellent job, definitely gave me the creeps.",t3_kn5zqs
ghkm9g5,t3_kn5zqs,Also from the eastern shore! Great story!,t3_kn5zqs

Great story!",t3_kn5zqs
ghldttl,t3_kn5zqs,Holy shit. This was the scariest thing Iâ€™ve read in a while. Great job!,t3_kn5zqs
ghmbabw,t3_kn5zqs,"Oh my god, the 'soft as a marshmallow' image really got to me haha. I loved the name 'violet cave' as well, it made it seem almost cosmic and purple to me. More stories!",t3_kn5zqs

ghkbvr4,t1_ghiitdy,You must have also just watched that unsettling cave diving movie Hulu is pushing right now. *shudder*,t3_kn5zqs
ghj0txs,t1_ghiyk7u,"I am so, so glad someone picked up on the similarities. I've been reading a TON about Vortex Spring lately (hence the cave name starting with a 'V'). I molded the sign after the one from Vortex and Calvin stealing the key was a reference to Ben MCDaniel not being allowed to rent the key at the shop because he lacked the correct certification.",t3_kn5zqs
ghwg1po,t1_ghiyk7u,"That's the standard sign for dangerous aquatic caves, we have them in Florida too :)",t3_kn5zqs

Very much right back at you. Your story, ""Albert,"" this week is hands down one of my favorite pieces from this subreddit in the last year. Just lovely work.",t3_kn5zqs
ghl89d6,t1_ghkbvr4,Whatâ€™s it called?,t3_kn5zqs
ghkyim0,t1_ghkbvr4,Whatâ€™s the movie lol,t3_kn5zqs
ghj175f,t1_ghj0txs,"Ayyyyyeeee! Thought so! It was the stolen key that clicked it for me. 


Loved it, btw. The Ben McDaniel story freaks me out due to the claustrophobic element and this captured that PERFECTLY.",t3_kn5zqs
glpkf30,t1_ghj0txs,I was just watching videos about Ben's case yesterday and came across your story today so it immediately clicked! Amazing read!,t3_kn5zqs

ghktvtz,t1_ghkssjc,"Gotta be alive though when they go in the pot, *that's* a necessity. I do have to say, in all seriousness, I cannot listen to them scrabbling and scratching at the sides. But damn, they taste soooo good with melted butter or vinegar.",t3_kn5zqs
