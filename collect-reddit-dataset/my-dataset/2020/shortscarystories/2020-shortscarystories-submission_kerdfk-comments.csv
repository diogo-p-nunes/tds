gg4bw87,t3_kerdfk,I'm not understanding,t3_kerdfk
gg5twpo,t3_kerdfk,"Haaa!! I love this so much. The writing style you chose here really meshes well with the character you created, like I can picture this guy and I can see him panicking then spiraling, all the while with Cage's smiling face every time he looks down.

Have you ever seen Tales from the Hood 3? One of the stories is about a guy who steals someone's shoes then can't take them off. He has some similar sanitary problems, and I'm glad you included how gross that would be rather than ignore it.

All those details just came together great and made an overall pretty original story. Great job!",t3_kerdfk
