gep54nu,t3_k760ii,"This was all over the place and didn't make sense. I understand about her maybe being a vampire at the end, but the storyline did not lead to that conclusion.",t3_k760ii
gep4u0e,t3_k760ii,Scary Mixed with a recent AITA post? üòÅ,t3_k760ii
geq1ahe,t3_k760ii,"The story was all over the place. Why the daughter want it to talk to the husband? Why mention the thing about demons and spirits? that didn't go anywhere. Why the daughter doesn't remember each time they visit? I think you had like 2 o 3 general ideas who separate can work out as at least two different stories, but together they are a mess, when the first part doesn't seems to had a relation with the last part and ending.",t3_k760ii
gep0e4w,t3_k760ii,I don't get it. Can someone explain pls?,t3_k760ii
gep2go3,t3_k760ii,Good thing you didn't let her in. Great story btw,t3_k760ii
geq8q4t,t3_k760ii,Downvote,t3_k760ii
gewvjbc,t3_k760ii,This story is lowkey kinda trash,t3_k760ii
gepen3e,t1_gep54nu,This. None of this makes sense. She was already allowed into the home previously. I guess she recently became a vampire? But what does that have anything to do with the first part of the story?,t3_k760ii

geq2x8p,t1_geq1ahe,"This story was taken from an r/aita post about OPs friend bringing over her 16 yo daughter and forcing her to interact with OPs husband, to the point where husband would leave if friends was coming over so friend started showing up with her daughter unannounced.  The final straw for OP was when her friend and friends daughter showed up unannounced when husband was in the shower and her friend told her 16yo daughter to go find husband in the shower.  Friend would also do other creepy and disrespectful things while visiting op and husband with her daughter.",t3_k760ii
gep28e5,t1_gep0e4w,The daughter is floating at a window and needs permission to come into the home. She is a vampire. She also had bite marks on her neck earlier in the story. In classic tales vampires cannot enter your home unless you invite them in.,t3_k760ii
geq37hv,t1_gep6o2q,I added my own supernatural twist to it,t3_k760ii
geq5ohz,t1_geq2x8p,"Ok. that is why it feel like two different stories. Well you could  work with it, I mean the horror is there, but like I said is all over the place, so my suggesti√≥n will be to scrap some parts and then try to play with the supernatural with the girl, I think possessed child may work better than a suddenly vampire, with her forgetting meeting the character before and talking about a spirits and demons.",t3_k760ii
geq38yt,t1_geq2x8p,And I added my own supernatural twist to it,t3_k760ii
geq3bmr,t1_gep28e5,Yeah the classical vampires were the best,t3_k760ii
geq3bqq,t1_geq38yt,"It was a good premise, I think if you keep refining it it‚Äôll be a great story.",t3_k760ii
geq3f9a,t1_geq3bqq,Kinda stuck at where to take it,t3_k760ii
geq47ze,t1_geq3f9a,"I would go back to the original post and work backward. Come up with a back story for the friend, her daughter, and the OP/Husband.  Come up with scary reasons why the friend and her daughter are so obsessed with the husband.  Use some of the comments for ideas. Start where you want the story to end and work back, keep reading it out loud to yourself to make sure every paragraph makes sense. Sometimes the scariest stories are the ones that can happen in real life. IMO vampires is a bit over done so it‚Äôs hard to come up with and ending that hasn‚Äôt been read before. 

Ie- what would happen if the daughter showed up when OP wasn‚Äôt there.  Or if she had gone into the bathroom while husband was showering.  Why does the Friend tell everyone her daughter is gay when she‚Äôs not?  Why do they keep showing up to OPs house uninvited and unannounced? Why does the daughter go along with the mothers attempts to push her off onto a grown man? Who is the daughters bio dad?  Why did the friend and her daughter suddenly start clinging to op and husband? What was the mother doing for the 16 years she wasn‚Äôt in OPs life?",t3_k760ii
geq4fgj,t1_geq47ze,Woah that was well thought out,t3_k760ii
geq4tyr,t1_geq4fgj,Well it was a weird ass post. What mother tells her 16yo daughter to force and corner and get from the shower a grown married man?,t3_k760ii
geq4wka,t1_geq4tyr,Yeah I know lol,t3_k760ii
