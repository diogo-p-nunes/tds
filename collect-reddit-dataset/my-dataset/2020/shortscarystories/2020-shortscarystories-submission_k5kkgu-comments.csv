gefgf03,t3_k5kkgu,"Wow I really liked this, very well written!!",t3_k5kkgu
geg1lfo,t3_k5kkgu,"It's so well written, good job! I saw the twist coming from the beginning, but your story kept me hooked on. Keep it up!",t3_k5kkgu
gefna1v,t3_k5kkgu,"Wow! I was expecting a twist, but not that- that was great!",t3_k5kkgu
gegebqu,t3_k5kkgu,You spoiled the narrator being a villain when he dogeared the book.,t3_k5kkgu
geg93dv,t3_k5kkgu,"Hi guys! If you like my work and would love to read more similar ones, I have an independent page on Instagram (@itsalongstoryshort_   Yes there’s an underscore) and I’d really appreciate the support. Thank you! ❤️",t3_k5kkgu
gegdlsd,t3_k5kkgu,I was thinking of fifty first dates as I was reading through but that twist blew me away. Nice job.,t3_k5kkgu
gegg031,t3_k5kkgu,The scariest part of this is that dog-eared page,t3_k5kkgu
gegb54f,t3_k5kkgu,I wasn’t expecting that. I just thought it would be just another sad Alzheimer’s story. Good job exceeding my expectations!,t3_k5kkgu
gegdrql,t3_k5kkgu,"Loved it like most of the comments here already. One suggestion would be perhaps having Charlotte's Alzheimer's being the cause of her death, otherwise it feels like the Alzheimers is just a plot device.",t3_k5kkgu
geg7cmh,t3_k5kkgu,Holy shit this was incredible,t3_k5kkgu
gegfsu3,t3_k5kkgu,"Love it! Great work, OP!",t3_k5kkgu
gegw4fs,t3_k5kkgu,"I enjoyed this and your writing style is great, but I was a little confused about something. Why would the man have ‘taken steps to not let her Alzheimer’s take full control’? What traditions is he honouring? Given that it’s not his actual wife and that the Alzheimer’s is the only thing that enables him to keep this woman with him.",t3_k5kkgu
gegybls,t3_k5kkgu,Maybe I’ve been on this sub and read so many stories that the twist was screaming out by the second paragraph. Good read though. Very chilling.,t3_k5kkgu
gegic88,t3_k5kkgu,The real horror is the dog-earing of the page,t3_k5kkgu
gegj97e,t3_k5kkgu,This is good! Kinda reminds me of that movie with Nicole Kidman and the dude from Love Actually,t3_k5kkgu
geivrmc,t3_k5kkgu,Any person who dog ears a book is evil!,t3_k5kkgu
gwcmd1y,t3_k5kkgu,"I saw the twist coming but the story was still captivating! which is a very hard thing to do, congrats!",t3_k5kkgu
geg7ctq,t3_k5kkgu,"Good story, but lacks ""depth"" and is pretty predictable, but a overall really good concept. Keep up with the good work op!",t3_k5kkgu
gegov5q,t3_k5kkgu,Oh wow I wasn’t expecting that!,t3_k5kkgu
gegumsq,t3_k5kkgu,Great story even though I saw the twist coming about halfway through it still hold up the creep factor regardless,t3_k5kkgu
gegvdjl,t3_k5kkgu,"I was reading it like ""OK, this is gonna go one of 2 ways"" but still what a ride! Brilliant work",t3_k5kkgu
gegy3pc,t3_k5kkgu,I knew that he was the bad guy as soon as he did that unspeakable thing to a book.,t3_k5kkgu
geh5p2x,t3_k5kkgu,I was certainly fooled by the title! I began to read the story feeling very sad for you... and then poof...it turned into something very different and very scary! I will certainly check out more of your stories! Good job!,t3_k5kkgu
geh5rvx,t3_k5kkgu,I did NOT expect that. Great story! I LOVE it!,t3_k5kkgu
geh72zq,t3_k5kkgu,"When I read the title I thought it was a kidnapping situation. I wasn't wrong, but I certainly didn't expect the ending!",t3_k5kkgu
gehbjkq,t3_k5kkgu,I did not expect that! This was very well done!,t3_k5kkgu
gehdv2e,t3_k5kkgu,Amazing story. It's almost like I could put myself in this guys shoes. No matter how horrible the crimes.,t3_k5kkgu
gehheq5,t3_k5kkgu,Excellent! I love this.,t3_k5kkgu
gehm1zr,t3_k5kkgu,"I saw this coming right from the start, however it was really well written and I love the concept :)",t3_k5kkgu
gehqdtc,t3_k5kkgu,Damn,t3_k5kkgu
gehr1yg,t3_k5kkgu,"Right when I read 'the heavy dose of medication' I knew exactly where this was going. 

Fantastic writing style, I absolutely adore it. 

I can't wait to see more from you.",t3_k5kkgu
gehvvt4,t3_k5kkgu,👏👏👏,t3_k5kkgu
gehwkhk,t3_k5kkgu,I can only join in on the choir of the other commenters. Very well done!!,t3_k5kkgu
gei0pxb,t3_k5kkgu,"This is such a little change, but the word “monologue” is deeply rooted in evil characters. The connotation is so strong that it gave away the ending for me. Perhaps change it to “speech” or some other synonym? Lovely story! I adore your writing style",t3_k5kkgu
gei93gm,t3_k5kkgu,"totally saw that coming (the ""downside"" of posting in this sub is you kind of expect a twist), but still was a very nice read.",t3_k5kkgu
gejh8yw,t3_k5kkgu,Oooooooff... I love this sub tbh.,t3_k5kkgu
gelslas,t3_k5kkgu,"Excellent tale Long Story, you got to the point perfectly in my opinion. Can wait to read more of your works. Thank you. 😈❤️",t3_k5kkgu
genrijw,t3_k5kkgu,Great story! I loved the ending!,t3_k5kkgu
gerpo3j,t3_k5kkgu,fantabulous.,t3_k5kkgu
gh94tae,t3_k5kkgu,"Interesting twist. I read in other comments that you're open to a little constructive criticism. Maybe give a few details where the reader will know the woman isn't his wife, Charlotte, but he's convinced himself the car accident caused amnesia. Instead of Alzheimers. Someone who acknowledges their delusion won't immediately fall back into it. He would be in adamant denial. To avoid taking responsibility or accepting what happened, he would convince himself the woman resembling his dead wife *must be* her.",t3_k5kkgu
gi16bi8,t3_k5kkgu,when your name is Charlotte 😳,t3_k5kkgu
gp0ky17,t3_k5kkgu,"Saw the ending coming but I had to keep going because the writing style is SO addictive, OP!
Nicely done :))",t3_k5kkgu
gegkytu,t3_k5kkgu,"I was thinking there was gonna be some reincarnation shenanigans, just my weeb side showing.",t3_k5kkgu
gehzric,t3_k5kkgu,So did his original wife have Alzheimer's...?,t3_k5kkgu
gegz45j,t3_k5kkgu,"Damn, this is a whole movie plot!",t3_k5kkgu
gefhop9,t1_gefgf03,Thank you so much! ☺️,t3_k5kkgu
geg41ng,t1_geg1lfo,Thank you so much! I’m glad you like it ☺️,t3_k5kkgu
gefs953,t1_gefna1v,Haha I’m glad! Thank you so much!,t3_k5kkgu
gegeuf4,t1_gegebqu,"AHAHAHAH, dammit, I was doing so well 😂",t3_k5kkgu
gejzze1,t1_gegebqu,This is actually so so true. As soon as I read it I thought “this guys a prick”,t3_k5kkgu
gegsaec,t1_geg93dv,">@itsalongstoryshort\_

Excellent story!! Just followed you on Instagram.",t3_k5kkgu
gegdnuz,t1_gegdlsd,"Hahaha well, it is kind of fifty first dates, only darker. Thank you! ☺️",t3_k5kkgu
gegbu2w,t1_gegb54f,"Haha thank you so much, I’m glad I did ☺️",t3_k5kkgu
gegjagt,t1_gegdrql,"So the original idea was that the guilt of his own doing, drunk driving kind of drove him into a hysteria which then led to this kidnapping and convincing himself that the lady he kidnapped has a disease or something was wrong. Grief often takes various forms in people’s lives and I wanted to capture the point of paranoia that it brought in the husband’s. But yes, I guess I should’ve cleared up just a little bit so that one theme connects it all together. Will work on that!",t3_k5kkgu
gegeq0u,t1_gegdrql,I read it as the author kidnapped a lady with Alzheimer's to convince her she was Charlotte.,t3_k5kkgu
geg8ut1,t1_geg7cmh,Haha thank you so much!,t3_k5kkgu
gegfx23,t1_gegfsu3,Thank you so much!,t3_k5kkgu
gegwka1,t1_gegw4fs,"Hello! Thank you for the lovely comment, I shall try and answer your query to the best of my abilities. 

I wanted to portray the husband stuck in a guilt driven savior complex situation. He’s trying to process the death of his actual wife, a consequence of his own actions and that grief has turned him into this person that’s beyond recognition. 

This woman is heavily drugged, she isn’t actually diagnosed with Alzheimer’s but he’s created a reality in which she is and he’s trying his best to wipe his slate clean. He truly believes by bringing back the old traditions someday this strange woman will actually be his own Charlotte. 

I hope that made sense 🙈",t3_k5kkgu
geg8xq1,t1_geg7ctq,Thank you! It gets pretty tough to create something complex in 500 words so I’ll def work on that! 😬,t3_k5kkgu
gegvh6v,t1_gegvdjl,Thank you so much! ❤️,t3_k5kkgu
geh6m4n,t1_geh5p2x,Thank you so much! I’m really glad you enjoyed it ☺️,t3_k5kkgu
geh77xj,t1_geh72zq,"Hahaha thank you so much, glad I caught you off guard! ☺️",t3_k5kkgu
gehiqnp,t1_gehdv2e,Oh wow. That’s a huge compliment! Thank you so much ☺️,t3_k5kkgu
gehv21k,t1_gehr1yg,Thank you so much! Do check out some of my other works on my profile if you did like this one ☺️❤️,t3_k5kkgu
gehyqt9,t1_gehwkhk,Hahaha thank you so much! ❤️☺️,t3_k5kkgu
gei0zo9,t1_gei0pxb,"Oh wow really? I honestly use monologue on various occasions but good tip, I shall keep that in mind! Thank you so much!",t3_k5kkgu
gp0xkb1,t1_gp0ky17,Ahahahah thank youuuu ❤️❤️,t3_k5kkgu
gegqhhp,t1_gegkytu,"Hahaha no, just plain old kidnapping :P The usual.",t3_k5kkgu
geh4n3a,t1_gegz45j,That is the dream 😊,t3_k5kkgu
geg8ov7,t1_geg41ng,I loved it. I knew a twist was coming but I love the way you played it! Great read!,t3_k5kkgu
gegsmo4,t1_gegsaec,"Hi Chris! Thanks so much for the follow, really means a lot ☺️",t3_k5kkgu
geo7z4i,t1_gegdnuz,fifty shades darker 😂,t3_k5kkgu
geh27x7,t1_gegjagt,"I like that Charlotte died unintentionally, but at the narrator’s hand. I feel that is the best way for this story to be founded. 

To me, it seemed implied that Charlotte 2.0 didn’t actually have Alzheimer’s at all, but rather that was entirely the narrator’s attempt to convince Charlotte 2.0 and Narrator both that she was, in fact, Charlotte.",t3_k5kkgu
geh6zdo,t1_gegwka1,"Wow. It does make sense. Great story. Hope this is a movie someday! Heck, why not make this into a series of stories? I would be hooked...",t3_k5kkgu
gew2xem,t1_geg8xq1,"Predictable, yes, but touching nonetheless. Reminds me of some Criminal Minds episodes! Watching those kinds of shows definitely spoiled quite a few twists on this sub for me 😅",t3_k5kkgu
geh2e3x,t1_geh27x7,YES SPOT ON! I’m so glad you got it because that is exactly what I wanted to capture. I wanted to show how crazy the narrator had gotten with the guilt and the love for his dead wife that he’d get this weird savior complex.,t3_k5kkgu
geh76yo,t1_geh6zdo,"Hahaha movie/short film is the ultimate dream and I do hope for that one day! I’ve got very similar types of stories on Instagram (@itsalongstoryshort_), I have to modify most for Reddit to match some of the subreddits but insta’s a free place :P Do check it out if you have time! ❤️☺️",t3_k5kkgu
gehds0i,t1_geh76yo,I will most definitely check it out!! I'll give you a follow. 😊,t3_k5kkgu
