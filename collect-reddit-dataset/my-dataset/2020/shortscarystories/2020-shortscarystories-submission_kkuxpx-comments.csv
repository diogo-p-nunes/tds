gh4kuae,t3_kkuxpx,"/u/LucasIsBadAtReddit, I have found an error in your post:

 > “strikes when ~~your~~ [**you're**] at your weakest”

I deem this comment by you, LucasIsBadAtReddit, incorrect; it should say “strikes when ~~your~~ [**you're**] at your weakest” instead. ‘Your’ is possessive; ‘you're’ means ‘you are’.

 ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!)",t3_kkuxpx
