ghh21ya,t3_kmurdj,"This one thoroughly disgusted me and even made me gag a little, but since I'm a little bit sadistic, great job!!",t3_kmurdj
ghj2kuw,t3_kmurdj,"TIL about fruit fly eggs in ketchup and I really wish I could unlearn that particular fact. Am I abnormal in thinking I'd handle the cremains better than insect eggs? Joking...?

Grossly great!!",t3_kmurdj
ghi0ku8,t1_ghgucv4,Ayyy I like this version of the story wayy more than your one on r/TheCrypticCompendium! Good stuff,t3_kmurdj
ghh35g2,t1_ghh21ya,"Haha good stuff. yeah, I don‚Äôt know what it is for me about body horror. It‚Äôs (by far) the genre that troubles me the most and makes me very uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt get through The Fly (or really anything directed by David Cronenberg) but can watch/read other scary stuff all day long. 

I think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfacing my fears type thing.‚Äù Posting body horror on Reddit and reading the comments feels like I‚Äôm getting help shouldering the misery üòÇ",t3_kmurdj
ghjg6oq,t1_ghj2kuw,I didn‚Äôt know about the ketchup fact until I did some research when expanding the piece! Hot dogs will never be the same.,t3_kmurdj

ghit153,t1_ghi0ku8,Thanks for reading! Yeah the ones on Cryptic Compendium are super challenging due to limited word count (part of the design I think!) but I always get cool ideas for stories by taking a stab at it.,t3_kmurdj
ghjhi0m,t1_ghjg6oq,"I mean, I knew about the maggots in canned mushrooms. And speaking of hot dogs... üòõ

I still eat both though! I guess I'm immune since I grew up eating scrapple.",t3_kmurdj
ghjiy4f,t1_ghjhi0m,Omgggggggg just looked up scrapple. Looks amazing.,t3_kmurdj
ghjm923,t1_ghjiy4f,"It actually is delicious! I had a friend who would eat it cold, straight out of the fridge. Which was, to say the least, disgusting. But when cooked properly it's great!",t3_kmurdj
