ggdi5wz,t3_kg7oq9,Sounds like this woman has Capgras Syndrome and needs some serious help. Nice job!,t3_kg7oq9
ggdwdnh,t3_kg7oq9,this would fit SO much better in /r/nosleep.,t3_kg7oq9
ggfosc5,t3_kg7oq9,I remember this story. Still got the same weird gut feeling,t3_kg7oq9
ggdik61,t1_ggdi5wz,"That’s what I was thinking as well. It’s really sad if no one in her family has noticed that there’s something wrong with her. Hopefully the post being removed means that she got treatment rather than, you know... “solving the problem” more directly.",t3_kg7oq9
ggfyshc,t1_ggfosc5,Wait what? It's real?,t3_kg7oq9
ggj84ai,t1_ggfosc5,"Wait, was there a real situation like this? I just wrote this from my head because I was obssesed with capgras syndrome a while back, I didn't know there was someone out there who actually tried this, omg.",t3_kg7oq9
ggg6l6f,t1_ggfyshc,Not that I know of. I just read this somewhere a while back. All though I don’t think it was told from the perspective of this person recounting the story. I think it was just the « I’m looking for someone to kill my kid » by itself on some other horror post. Sorry for the confusion,t3_kg7oq9
gh1simf,t1_ggj84ai,"No no no, to my knowledge, there hasn’t been anything like this. I just have a memory of being on some website similar to Reddit and reading something like this. Like the top part about the mother. There was no follow up like this story you wrote, which I find pretty cool. Idk, maybe this is just some weird déjà-vu thing lol",t3_kg7oq9
gggaeiy,t1_ggg6l6f,"OOOh spooky, now I'm curious about the post being real or not o____o. But just like the writer mentioned, the original post has been deleted. Bummer. Thank you for telling me! ‪(.◜◡◝ )‬",t3_kg7oq9
