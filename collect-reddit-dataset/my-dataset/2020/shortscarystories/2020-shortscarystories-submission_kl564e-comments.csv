gh6ukk1,t3_kl564e,First time writing so criticism very much appreciated.,t3_kl564e
gh7011t,t3_kl564e,This is really great. The story is brought to a high point and a resolution and that can be great if you do it right. Usually horror ends with some sort of death and cliffhanger and you nailed that. So great job. You detail every little action with word choice and detail description. This is a good story. Im no expert but ill read more of these,t3_kl564e
gh6z6j9,t3_kl564e,I really like this! The ending had me feeling real dread. Great work!,t3_kl564e
gh9ntrs,t3_kl564e,Really really good; that nanosecond of hope when the protagonist ISNâ€™T dead... only to loop. How awful. And great.,t3_kl564e
ghah4o9,t3_kl564e,Thank you very much for the feedback everyone!,t3_kl564e
