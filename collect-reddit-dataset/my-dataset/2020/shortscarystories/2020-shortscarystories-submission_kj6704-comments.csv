ggv3pax,t1_ggv36cj,Haha holy shit I had no idea his name was David Crosby! (Of Crosby/Stills/Nash/Young game) That brings a whole new level of terror to this. There is a real book store owner named David Cosby so I thought I was being creative 😂 apparently just ripping off the name of a famous musician. But tbh it’s actually becoming an even cooler horror story imagining an aging rockstar being the bookstore owner 🤘,t3_kj6704

ggv85jn,t1_ggv19rq,"He/she is making reference to the Book-it program. It's apparently still around, but in the 80's/90's it was a big deal to get a free personal pan from Pizza Hut. It eventually went from personal pan coupons to group pizza parties during school hours.

ggvaf6j,t1_ggv96tm,"I could also tell about the time I made a punk kid cry in that restaurant. He bawled like a newborn baby too. Its been 30 years and I can still hear the exact sound of it.
