gfhha83,t1_gfft58w,"That's who I meant. I'm guessing her fiance never came back out of the house because she waited until the sun rose and then ""walked away, wondering how to explain this to his parents"".  Does one just *decide* to be a toll-collector? Or, do they have to complete the hell house first? Also, I'm still unsure what the point is. What does one gain by giving up their finger, lips, dignity, etc.?",t3_kaqz4m
gfjz4ld,t1_gfhha83,"It was definitely the protagonist's choice to come back and be a toll-collector, although she was invited. One can only put so much lore into five-hundred words, but the way I thought of it is that the fingerman saw that the protagonist wouldn't be able to reintegrate into society and had a festering emptiness inside of her that qualified her for the job.

I'm not really sure if the house is completable and kills or traps you or if the tolls kill you before you find the entrance, if there is an entrance, but you have to turn back before you die to be a toll collector. I don't think that the guy ever got his crab dinner.

The point is that there is no point. The protagonist is stuck and desperate. She's from a bad family, pregnant, and her  fianc√© calls her his girlfriend. The couple seems to think that they'll be financial reward for their sacrifice, but I don't want the house to be a metaphor for capitalism or the housing market or something like that. The toll-collectors don't really get anything out of it, either. Lips, dignity, and fingers aren't transferable; it's just a loss.",t3_kaqz4m
