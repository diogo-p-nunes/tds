gfavmmt,t3_kafmcw,Wow üòÆ,t3_kafmcw
gfaypej,t3_kafmcw,So well (and sadly) told.  Good build to the twist.  Obvious precedent with Sixth Sense but great job with not *letting* it be obvious until the end is near.,t3_kafmcw
gfb5976,t3_kafmcw,"Wow this is heartbreaking. Great job, I was waiting to find out what the real D word was, even suspected it was Dead or Death, but I thought it was going in a possible murder/suicide direction or something similar. I did not guess that the narrator was dead. That's one cool thing about short stories, that it gives you less time to analyze so it's easier to get caught in the twist, which is always good in story telling.",t3_kafmcw
