ggkekc4,t3_khcf1p,"Hey people! üëã

Not a native speaker, thus I‚Äôm not sure I could reproduce the thoughts of a kid convincingly through their words. Apologies on that.

Also, one of my first stories here. Don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know what you think!",t3_khcf1p
ggm0k3o,t3_khcf1p,aaaaaaaAAAAAA nonono I don't like this,t3_khcf1p
ggmdbig,t3_khcf1p,I don‚Äôt get it. Not being snarky. Can someone explain it to me?,t3_khcf1p
ggo90uq,t3_khcf1p,"The ending is sad, but honestly the kids might be better off. Assuming the system keeps together, they could end up with more emotionally stable parents.",t3_khcf1p
ggkj1ro,t3_khcf1p,Great story! Love the twist:),t3_khcf1p
ggnsfit,t3_khcf1p,Oh my good god.,t3_khcf1p
ggkvoam,t1_ggkekc4,The speech is certainly not the way every child would speak or think but it sounds incredibly believable. I could definitely imagine a kid speaking like that.,t3_khcf1p
ggmfiw3,t1_ggmdbig,"I think the parents left their kids at the beach, telling them to ‚Äúgo get ice cream‚Äù as an excuse to buy enough time to leave.",t3_khcf1p
ggnpxrw,t1_ggmdbig,"u/QuinnTamashi77 has hit a bulls-eye! But if you ask, there's a little extra context here. Parents were fighting a lot. As though not visible enough, the reason was the kids. You know, post-pregnancy depression and all.

The solution they found? Well, you might be already aware of it.",t3_khcf1p
ggp1fcm,t1_ggo90uq,"I‚Äôm with you. That‚Äôs not a healthy environment for kids to be, and this is something I want to explore in an incoming venture I‚Äôll post here as well.

Anyways, I remember when I was a kid how afraid I was without my parents around. To me, being abandoned like they were is just brutal horror. Ghosts and spirits don‚Äôt even come close.",t3_khcf1p
ggnhy8g,t1_ggmfiw3,Oh damn,t3_khcf1p
