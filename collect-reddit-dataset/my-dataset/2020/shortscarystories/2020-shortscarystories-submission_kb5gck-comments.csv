The power of suggestion is a thing. If you set out looking for something you'll end up finding something. The human brain is hardwired to find patterns, even when there is none. 

Yes those guys found an actual corpse, but they had to jump a fence over some rocks and rummage into what most people would considered trash (an abandoned suitcase). Another girl had a traumatic experience while driving to the pointed location (she witnessed an accident where people died or something similar, i don't remember). Let me repeat that: she never even got to the place the app pointed toward, she was driving towards it.

All these people were looking for something and ended up finding. Mind, I'm not saying that they deserve the trauma they got, or that they shouldn't be scarred from the experience. What I'm saying is that bad stuff happens all the time, but normally you don't pay much attention. Elderly people die alone and are found days or weeks later. Apparently well people kill themselves. But also smaller tragedies. People lose their job, or their home. Addiction. Abusive relationships.

Randonautica is not more haunted than the astrologer in the paper is able to predict your future. Both make you aware of your surroundings. Make you look for something (usually a concept generic enough that you'll be able to apply it to whatever you come in contact with). I'll make an example: let's say you look for ""death"" on the app (to stay in topic). What does it mean? A dead tree? A human corpse? A cemetery? A dead pidgeon? A deadly accident? An halloween decoration with skeletons and the Grim reaper? A natural history museum? A crematory? A gaggle of edgy teenagers with a surplus of eyeliner? A war memorial? I can go on, you see my point.

And I already know that someone is going to downvote this comment. It's fine. But if you read this far let me remind you that in the same way you can look for joy, and love, and creativity, and wisdom, and pay attention to all the good and not only the bad",t3_kb5gck
