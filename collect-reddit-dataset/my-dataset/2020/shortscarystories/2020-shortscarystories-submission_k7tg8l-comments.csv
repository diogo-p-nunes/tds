gett331,t3_k7tg8l,Oh shit. I was waiting for a story about spongy placenta mushrooms! I would‚Äôve known this was you even if I hadn‚Äôt seen the username. Great twist! I love your stories. üñ§,t3_k7tg8l

This one is dedicated to the one and only u/MoxyFoxtrot, who I know adores the **SPONGY PLACENTA MUSHROOMS**. In fact, she won‚Äôt stop talking about them. She goes on and on and on about how she would like to cut open my flesh, and stuff the exposed wounds full of **SPONGY PLACENTA** spores, and then gobble up the full grown placenta fungi.

She is quite persistent too, so I might just do it.

In any case, as always, feedback and critique is more than welcome!
