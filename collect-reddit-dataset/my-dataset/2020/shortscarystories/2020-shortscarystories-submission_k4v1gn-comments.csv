gedzi9x,t3_k4v1gn,"Fuck, I hate spiders. Reluctant upvote while feeling crawling all over me.",t3_k4v1gn
geh7z1z,t1_geaxrju,"Very creepy. Lots of fear factors. You are definitely talented. Just a few pointers: 1) When you state, ""That was the day..."" It needs to refer to a previously mentioned, but not yet explored, incident. Like, ""I was always afraid of spiders, though I had never been harm by one until last Tuesday. That was the day..."" 2) We get the impression that George's evil twin is exacting revenge, but for what? Is Mike just insane, or is Bill not as innocent as he seems? 3) You misspelled the last word; which is weird, because your grammar and spelling are pretty solid throughout the story. I look forward to reading more stories from you. Please write more",t3_k4v1gn
geh8aqa,t1_geh7z1z,"Thanks for the tips! I'll be sure to write some more stories. Sorry for the couple grammar mistakes in the story, english isn't my first language",t3_k4v1gn
geilxwr,t1_geh8aqa,"Actually, your grammar and English are very good. ""Pretty solid"" is a compliment. I'm still curious. Is Mike insane/evil, or did Bill do something to deserve the spiders?",t3_k4v1gn
geimjol,t1_geilxwr,"Mike is insane and since Bill owes him a lot of money, he decided to torture Bill. Unfortunately for Bill, in teh worst way possible",t3_k4v1gn
geimwxo,t1_geimjol,That makes it creepier. Thanks.,t3_k4v1gn
