gec54c0,t1_gec3io9,"This story has lots of interpretation but it's really up to you to decide. In my view, the child (main protag) is now a beggar roaming the street after the mother stole everything and ran away. When the child got too pressure, he/she began to hallucinating such as auditory delusions about the father's voice.

Same like us, if we are under too much pressure, we began to hallucinate something that can calm us down.

But really, you can view it by whatever you like!",t3_k4udif

gecpiam,t1_geauebn,"I think the ""I want to ___ every time I heard his voice"" sentences should be changed to ""wanted"" or ""hear"", the tense is inconsistent if that makes sense. Otherwise very good story!",t3_k4udif
