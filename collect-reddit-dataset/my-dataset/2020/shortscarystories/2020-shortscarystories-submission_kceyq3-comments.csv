gfqs351,t1_gfqr5fi,Found my purple 20Q two days ago in a box. Went to change the batteries and they were corroded. Bummer.,t3_kceyq3
gfrbfls,t1_gfqr5fi,I guess if you never buried your brother alive then you‚Äôre gonna be just fine,t3_kceyq3

They are dead",t3_kceyq3
gfs6eiz,t1_gfrsa1a,Because his answer was ‚Äúmy brother‚Äù. The dog just came up as a reference by the 20Q game to get a closer match to his answer.,t3_kceyq3

I assume the same is true for coke.",t3_kceyq3

gfspml4,t1_gfsiclk,I've never heard of coke exploding when you put it in water. Good to know!,t3_kceyq3
gftcez8,t1_gfsiclk,??? I can't tell if you're being facetious or not. You don't put the battery into the coke. You dip a toothbrush or something in coke and use it to clean the terminal that is corroded.,t3_kceyq3
