gesvwal,t3_k7ofik,As the father of a 13 year old girl that scream laughs to anime videos on youtube all hours of the day and night... I can relate. Great story!,t3_k7ofik
geudyl1,t3_k7ofik,"I dreamed so many times of doing this to my ex. I mean, he's ex for a reason. When a 46 year old man puts the damn XBox above conversation, above sex, above coming to prenatal appointments, you just want to kill him",t3_k7ofik
gez2j01,t3_k7ofik,"Sounds like my ex. He once turned the TV on in the bedroom, while I was asleep, to play Playstation. He bought the Playstation before he lost his job, but I bought the TV. I ripped the power cord out of the back of the TV and told him I would strangle him with it if he woke me up again. I recommend living with someone for a while before you marry them.",t3_k7ofik
