gh6hwtj,t3_kl21a2,I think this would be better if it was written as something happening now rather than before. Like 'You see' rather than 'you saw' etc. But a good first Try.,t3_kl21a2
gh6970u,t3_kl21a2,"Also, this is my first attempt at writing... well, anything! So, Iâ€™m sorry if it sucks, or if it isnâ€™t on par with the other, lovely stories of this beautiful subreddit. Thanks for reading!",t3_kl21a2
gh9oa7e,t3_kl21a2,"This is an excellent premise, and pretty well executed also. Re: feedback? Iâ€™d just say given the limited word count (which is a hard challenge, & terrific way to practice & get GREAT), every word needs to be there for a reason. 

Readers here know this, so will look to elements like colors for clues to your storyâ€™s theme if theyâ€™re repeated (that is, taking up valuable space.) If color is important here, by all means, leave it in. If not, use the space for clarity. 

Really well done start though! Impressive.",t3_kl21a2
ghd28o9,t3_kl21a2,"Made a few minor edits, mostly for clarity of some scenes",t3_kl21a2
gh8g31r,t1_gh6hwtj,"Absolutely, thank you very much. Iâ€™ll be sure to make edits! 

To be fair, this was the first story Iâ€™ve written, as I said, and I wrote it to go with a pair of eerie Liminal space images, in the span of about 30 minutes or so, but, Iâ€™m honestly surprised Iâ€™ve gotten good positive reception! Thanks a bunch, man.",t3_kl21a2
gh6mno6,t1_gh6970u,i think its a good start.,t3_kl21a2

ghd1he5,t1_gh9oa7e,"Well, the colors were there Because this story was written based off of two images as a sort of self-test, but, thank you so, so much for the positivity! I hope you have an absolutely wonderful day!",t3_kl21a2
ghaoo37,t1_gh8g31r,Just 30 minutes? That's impressive. And it was an interresting story. I liked the setting and the twist. Real potential. Can't wait to see what you do next. ðŸ˜Š,t3_kl21a2
ghd1i0f,t1_gh6mno6,Thanks bro!,t3_kl21a2
gh8fth4,t1_gh858kt,"Thatâ€™s just about the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me! And Iâ€™ll do just that, thank you very much!",t3_kl21a2
ghdgkk3,t1_ghd1he5,Thanks! You too. And thanks for the good read.,t3_kl21a2
ghd1oxx,t1_ghaoo37,"The setting makes a little more sense with the images that the story was written around, two liminal space living room photos, but thank you so much. I wasnâ€™t really planning on writing more, but your comment has absolutely inspired me to do more! If you have any suggestions for stories, Iâ€™d be very happy to write you one, personally, if I got the chance!",t3_kl21a2
