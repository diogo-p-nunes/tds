ghjly2l,t3_knc9a8,"I understand this perfectly well... And I am properly horrified, so thank you OP!",t3_knc9a8
ghkzsuq,t3_knc9a8,"This is very clever. So please take this as encouragement and not criticism. I really don't want to turn you away from writing and it's not meant to be condescending. Doing a spell check or using grammarly would keep the focus on the story better. That's all, thanks for sharing your clever story.",t3_knc9a8
ghjmit8,t3_knc9a8,Same as Saw 2!!  Nice!,t3_knc9a8
ghl02zf,t3_knc9a8,"To the cops defense, if the days turned to weeks and the weeks turned to months, that kid was dead in that safe months ago. The combo would have been less useful than the location of the safe.   


They could have gotten in with a nail file by this point in the story.",t3_knc9a8
ghliymk,t3_knc9a8,He would have suffocated anyway within hours poor boy.,t3_knc9a8
ghka2g8,t3_knc9a8,Well that was dark and creepy AF! I love it!,t3_knc9a8
ghjxks2,t3_knc9a8,Whoa. Poor son and wife.,t3_knc9a8
ghjyn7b,t3_knc9a8,Definitely— keep writing!,t3_knc9a8
ghjl9vs,t3_knc9a8,I hope people understand this XD,t3_knc9a8
ghktez6,t3_knc9a8,"Well done and, keep writing-you’re good!",t3_knc9a8
ghkw04q,t3_knc9a8,"Very impressive, especially considering your age. Keep it up!",t3_knc9a8
ghlufcf,t3_knc9a8,I thought this was awesome!,t3_knc9a8
ghlux8o,t3_knc9a8,Fantastic read!,t3_knc9a8
gi0td5k,t3_knc9a8,Really good my guy. Impressive writing in this one.,t3_knc9a8
ghlzy3t,t3_knc9a8,Did Mr. Oliver kill his wife or did the child kill the wife?,t3_knc9a8
ghkjn9g,t3_knc9a8,"awnser == ""answer""???",t3_knc9a8
ghjm8yc,t1_ghjly2l,Really? If so thank you so much. It's my first time writing anything horror especially since I'm still very young.,t3_knc9a8
ghlf6xf,t1_ghkzsuq,"I agree, I really enjoyed this and didn’t see the end coming. Improving the grammar would have really polished it",t3_knc9a8
ghjn3qq,t1_ghjmit8,What's saw? Like the movie? I haven't seen any of them but the inspiration might have come from from a conversation with a freind who has seen it,t3_knc9a8
ghz8xbt,t1_ghl02zf,"Yeah, the kid would've died within the first hour or so (if it was a good safe) of asphyxiation. 

To the cops prosecution(?), if a suspect keeps repeating ""safe"" they should check for safes in the house.",t3_knc9a8
ghrysfm,t1_ghl02zf,Yea i imagined like the father fed him and gave him water before being captured,t3_knc9a8
ghjq1s2,t1_ghjl9vs,I don't get it,t3_knc9a8
ghrz7k7,t1_ghkw04q,Thx! And yep I'm in middle school and have a vacation rn so i wanna write a lot!,t3_knc9a8
ghrywp3,t1_ghlzy3t,Mr Oliver killed his wife before locking up his son in the safe,t3_knc9a8
ghkwgkw,t1_ghkjn9g,"wait what isn't that how awnser is written?

or have I just been making the same mistake as OP my whole life?",t3_knc9a8
ghjmmjb,t1_ghjm8yc,"Well hey, you did a great job! I hope you continue to share with us. This sub is very welcoming and new writers can get constructive criticism and pointers, never hate!!",t3_knc9a8
ghrykl6,t1_ghlf6xf,"As a middle schooler who has horrible grammar I'm glad it wasn't that terrible, but yea i will try and spell check my future work! Thank you :)",t3_knc9a8
ghjt1zy,t1_ghjn3qq,"Definitely inspired in Saw II. A parent confronts a killer who tells him that he'll find his son in a ""safe and secure state"" if he just sits down and talks to him. Turns out, his son was in a safe in the room the whole time. The safe unlocked itself after 2 hours, but the parent went apeshit on the killer before that and well, the argument goes on. I suggest you watch the movie.",t3_knc9a8
ghjqdbn,t1_ghjq1s2,He hid his son in a litteral safe,t3_knc9a8
ghlivqu,t1_ghkwgkw,"You are kidding, right?",t3_knc9a8
ghrz2n5,t1_ghkwgkw,Oh shi- it is anwser not awnser,t3_knc9a8
ghjmvp2,t1_ghjmmjb,I'll try and write often then! I really appreciate the constructive criticism and support I get when I join a community :),t3_knc9a8
ghjtl25,t1_ghjt1zy,Isn't the age limit 17? I'm too young to watch that so I have no idea where I took inspo from,t3_knc9a8
ghjyl2c,t1_ghjqdbn,Oh that makes sense,t3_knc9a8
ghm7ebc,t1_ghlivqu,no??,t3_knc9a8
ghl20li,t1_ghjtl25,"Yes, it’s rated R, so technically 17+ without parents and any age with parents. I saw the second movie when I was 9 and saw the first one when I was younger when it came out. I never had restrictions growing up though, so I started watching horror and other movies rated R or NC-17 since I was at least 2yr old, possibly younger.

Your story is really good though. I definitely enjoyed reading it!",t3_knc9a8
ghju7pm,t1_ghjtl25,"Oh well if you're too young then I'd recommend not watching it, it can leave you some trauma if you're not used to horror movies. I know a lot of redditors aren't adults, but I forget that sometimes, sorry.

And yeah, it might be a coincidence, but it just reminded me a lot of that film (Saw films are known for their plot twists!). 

Good story, in any case! Keep it up!",t3_knc9a8
ghjuemy,t1_ghju7pm,Yes I don't get scared easily but it's mainly because of my family. They are really strict when it comes to the internet,t3_knc9a8
