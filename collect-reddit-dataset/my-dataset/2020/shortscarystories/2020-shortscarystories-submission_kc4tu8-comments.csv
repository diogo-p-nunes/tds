gfnrogp,t3_kc4tu8,"Scary! That actually does happen to some people. I've never had that happen to me, but I woke up during surgery, once. I opened my eyes, lifted my head, and yelled, ""Shut up! I'm trying to sleep!"" Then I was out again. I remembered doing it afterwards. I told my mom about it. She was like, ""No. That was just a dream, honey."" The nurse said, ""Actually, she really did that. Scared the crap out of everyone in the operating room.""",t3_kc4tu8
gfp5avu,t3_kc4tu8,I woke up during foot surgery. I could feel them tinkering around and I just groggily asked my surgeon how he was doing. The look of horror on his face was the last thing I remembered before he yelled for the nurse.,t3_kc4tu8
gfnjik5,t3_kc4tu8,"I left another comment already but once I had a surgery (I think it counts) and I had to be put under, but it was only enough that if they called my name I would wake up or something. I remember being conscious (without opening my eyes) and feeling them prod around in my mouth (where the surgery was). It wasn’t painful or anything, though without anesthesia it probably would’ve been. I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want to disturb them.",t3_kc4tu8
gfoyj5b,t3_kc4tu8,"I had an endoscopy (procedure where they put a tube with a camera down your throat into the stomach) when I was 18 to check for ulcers. I  was supposed to be asleep for the whole thing, but I woke up in the middle of it. I remember thinking, ""oh hey, they're not done yet"" just as the doctor noticed and said, ""oh no, she's awake, give her some more..."" whatever anesthetic they were using. And I just closed my eyes and went back to sleep. But I clearly remember exactly what happened, and the doctor confirmed that it did happen just that way. Really weird.",t3_kc4tu8
gfntv15,t3_kc4tu8,"This is an amazing story! However, for those commenting.. we actually do know how anesthesia works and a quick google search can explain it for you. TLDR version: it interrupts signals from nerves to brain, making it so you can't feel pain and don't remember what happened. So the story is based on the truth, which is what makes it even more amazing!",t3_kc4tu8
gfpw6l2,t3_kc4tu8,"This is a very good story! It's scary to me for two reasons.
1: obviously the main point of the story is that you can still feel pain while under anesthesia. Nobody wants that.
2: the question of whether you can completely forget about certain experiences is something I think about a lot. Could there be parts of my life that are just... missing?",t3_kc4tu8
gfnj89f,t3_kc4tu8,"The thing that’s scariest about this is that we don’t actually know if this is what happens. It reminds me of falling asleep. No one remembers falling asleep the next day, so it’s like it never happened.",t3_kc4tu8
gfovztq,t3_kc4tu8,"Isn’t there a type of anesthesia that works this exact way that until recently was used or may still be used as a “sedative” in veterinary medicine, at least? Paralytic of some type?",t3_kc4tu8
gfpipuy,t3_kc4tu8,"How about ....
What if every patients actually feel everything at the time being. Or they actually experienced hundred of thousands of years every time they were knocked out. 
But when they wake up, each of them forgot the terror that they once felt and told you that its all okay.",t3_kc4tu8
gfody78,t1_gfnrogp,"Apparently that happens when the paralysing stuff wears out but not the sedative so the patient is just sleepy and awake but doesn't feel pain

Can't find the link to the article",t3_kc4tu8
gfp49pf,t1_gfnrogp,What surgery were you having. How did you yell out? If you were under a general anaesthetic wouldnt you have had something in your airway?,t3_kc4tu8
gfpkx1q,t1_gfnrogp,"I had my appendix removed recently. The doctor told my wife afterwards that they had to aenesthetize me once more because I was not out the first time. I don't recall waking up, but it scares me thinking that I might have experienced something during that surgery. And more so if I ever have to go through other surgeries in the future.",t3_kc4tu8
gfnoa89,t1_gfnjik5,It’s called a twilight surgery :),t3_kc4tu8
gfpxsvb,t1_gfnjik5,I’ve had the same thing. I jaw when I sleep. They had to wake me up to wedge my jaw open,t3_kc4tu8
gfpei7d,t1_gfntv15,">TLDR version: it interrupts signals from nerves to brain, making it so you can't feel pain and don't remember what happened. So the story is based on the truth, which is what makes it even more ~~amazing~~ terrifying! 

Fixed that for ya",t3_kc4tu8
gfoqcf5,t1_gfntv15,"Yeah... we have no idea how it does that though. That's just a description of the event of losing consciousness. Not how it's done. It's like asking, how does a car engine work and you say ""well you put the key in the ignition and turn it and then the engine works.",t3_kc4tu8
gfrtk5a,t1_gfpw6l2,"What worries me about this is that even if I don’t remember any of it consciously, the memory might exist, at least in part, in my unconscious memory. Which means it could become conscious some day. Although if this actually happened, even to a small percentage of post-surgery patients, that would still amount to a lot of people, in which case, we would have known about it already. No way to keep something like that secret if people keep reporting experiences like this.",t3_kc4tu8
gfntl46,t1_gfnj89f,We do know...,t3_kc4tu8
gfq2jmp,t1_gfoqcf5,Again... we do know this. Anesthesia works by attaching to receptors in the brain. I'm really not sure what kind of answer would satisfy here... maybe we are just having a semantics argument but I we definitely have a solid understanding of how anesthesia affects the body and what processes happen and why.,t3_kc4tu8
gfnuvzf,t1_gfntl46,W e d o ?,t3_kc4tu8
gfqouco,t1_gfq2jmp,".... sigh look this up. Check out the mayo clinic link. Thats one of the first ones from google and reliable for laymen more than literally the first result that pops up. I am a physician and we do not know. 

 Answer me this.. which receptors are being bound? Which parts of the brain? Whats the binding affinity? Which pathways are stopped? How does this turn off the ascending activiting reticular system that is in charge of sleep normally when the drugs actually dont seem to affect this area any more or less than other parts of the brain. There are dozens of tyoes of general anaesthetic. Please list the mechanisms of each one. If we knew how they worked then you could give me an explanation that is different for each one. 

""Attaching to receptors in the brain"" is as much of an answer as ""i pushed the button and it turned off""  

Dont speak of things you dont know. You literally dont even know what you dont know.",t3_kc4tu8

gfstazo,t1_gfqouco,I'm not a doctor. I'm not in the medical field or biology. This was a comment on a scary story and I was praising the author. I was not trying to be negative in any way and I sincerely apologize if it came across that way. I can understand your frustration because I feel the same when people talk about my field of expertise without knowing base knowledge. I will read more about this. Thanks for educating me.,t3_kc4tu8
gfrcp3x,t1_gfqsvid,"... that is no answer then. Because like I said, we don't even know what the receptor is.. therefore we don't even know it is a receptor.. actually 1 theory is that there is no receptor at all. 1 theory is it dissolves the fat in neurons decreasing the voltage for action potentials that leads to decreased activity.
So no that vague answer isn't even correct. We don't know it's a receptor. We don't know it binds to one. It's just someone throwing out pseudoscientific terms since it sounds lie something sciencey. It acts on the brain right cus the brain makes you sleep. And most things in the body Works on receptors right? So let's say it works on that. And the brain is made of neurons right? So let's be more specific and say it effects those. That is all they are doing.

It's bland pleasantries to fool people into thinking they have an answer when they don't have one. It's not semantics. It's bs ing. It's exactly like my example. It's ""how does a computer work? "" "" you press the button and it works. Tada"" I don't think any reasonable person would accept that as an answer. Maybe if you're trying to fool a child. You could do that with literally anything. Might as well say ""well God did it"" as an explanation. 

Why is the sky blue? Well the light that travels through the atmosphere beams Blue light into your eyes. Literally just describing the phenomenon but isn't an answer. 

And like I said, it may not even be correct in the vague terms. Not sure how else to explain it. The statement is just wrong because the explanation they give is just wrong. It is based on nothing. Ni evidence no studies. Its just random words that sound liek they could be true. Not sure what you don't understand.. but random bs ing science sounding words isn't understanding.",t3_kc4tu8
gfstjhu,t1_gfrcp3x,I kinda take back my other reply after reading this... do you even work in the medical field? You are calling science and medical research BS. So I'm kinda calling BS on you unless you have some evidence?,t3_kc4tu8
