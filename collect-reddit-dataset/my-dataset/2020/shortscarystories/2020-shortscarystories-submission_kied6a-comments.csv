ggqbq89,t3_kied6a,"/u/WanderingThrees, I have found some errors in your post:

 > “blew up, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like someone”

 > “planet, and ~~its~~ [**it's**] all rock”

In this post, it is you, WanderingThrees, who intended to write “blew up, ~~its~~ [**it's**] like someone” and “planet, and ~~its~~ [**it's**] all rock” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.
