gg5a81b,t3_keqp69,"I really liked your story. With this sub you expect things to go south, but this was still a little twist of an ending.

But your opening line... I don't get it. It doesn't make sense to me and it immediately jarred me out of fully enjoying the rest of the story. What were you trying to say?",t3_keqp69

""No, babe, it's not like that! You're wild, and I think you're amazing, you know that! It's just that a guy needs to be alone for it every once in a while, you know? That doesn't mean it's even close to being better than it is with you!""

gg5aoot,t1_gg5a81b,I was kinda hinting that they have been together for 2 years which implies how long they were doing it. Also the line about the similar hobbies is about them killing which is why they are perfect together and why the girl is not dead yet.,t3_keqp69

gg7dadn,t1_gg6qnup,"Do you mean *I know when my husband is cheating on me?* It is in the same vein, but I feel the twist is different. Maybe you mean another?

I just got d√©j√† vu reading this one, like the whole story structure and ending felt familiar. I'm definitely not saying OP ripped anyone off, I sure don't mean to imply that at all just for the record!

Honestly, I just read pretty much all the stories on this sub and plenty of full length books to boot. It's inevitable plots start repeating! William Foster Harris, in The Basic Patterns of Plot, says that the three plot types are the happy ending, the unhappy ending, and tragedy. The fun lies in the author's own spin on each one and the journey to the ending!

Anyway, sorry for this long winded comment! This was a well written story with a sneaky twist, and I definitely enjoyed it. OP deserves all those upvotes! D√©j√† vu is¬†just freaky though, kind of spooky in it's own right and always a weird experience.",t3_keqp69
ggd434n,t1_ggclcpj,"No, I didn't think OP was copying anyone. But sometimes the authors will repost their work with a few edits. That's why I was confused. 

It's a good story!",t3_keqp69
gg5ph64,t1_gg5aoot,"It works better if you just say, ""my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years"" 

I agree the first sentence is worded weird which makes it difficult to get into. I understood it, but I didn't like it. (the first sentence) the rest was great.",t3_keqp69
gg7wm2c,t1_gg7dadn,It's exactly what I thought,t3_keqp69
gg6vetk,t1_gg5ph64,Ohh that yeah. I though it was weird too. Grammarly corrected that lol and I just assumed it was correct,t3_keqp69
