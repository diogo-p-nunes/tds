gez41g8,t3_k8njfg,"Hi Everyone! In my previous story, I tried to write from the perspective of a protagonist who was part of a particularly ""cringy"" internet community.

I had a lot of fun with that, so for this post, I decided to try writing a far more tongue-in-cheek story from the perspective of someone who's a part of another, less cringe-worthy, internet community.

I love comments, and if anyone has any constructive criticism that would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading!",t3_k8njfg
