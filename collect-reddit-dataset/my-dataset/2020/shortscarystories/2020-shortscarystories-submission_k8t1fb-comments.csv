gfnoauf,t3_k8t1fb,"Even before reading the DEATH paragraph, I loved every bit of this.  And this is coming from someone who is relatively stong in their atheistic beliefs.  The last three, small paragraphs were really great, but I must admit that I'd have enjoyed this entire story, even if it had ended with religious overtones.",t3_k8t1fb
gfekqvk,t3_k8t1fb,"This is both tragic and somewhat scary. But you incorrectly named one of the horsemen, and you got it in the wrong order; it's supposed to be Conquest, War, Famine, and *then* Death. Also, it's unlikely a population decline would render manufacturing difficult, let alone cause oil scarcity. Or didn't you watch Avengers: Infinity War?",t3_k8t1fb
gfg82jv,t1_gfekqvk,"You're probably right but the order mattered less to me since they were just interpretation, not actual entities.

And yeah I just needed a smaller population to fight over resources for war lol, it's hard to explain that fully in less than 500 words so I went with what I could.

I appreciate the feedback tho, that's why I post on here.",t3_k8t1fb
