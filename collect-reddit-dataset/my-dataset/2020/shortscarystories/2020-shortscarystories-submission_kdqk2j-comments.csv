gfxy6lt,t3_kdqk2j,This story is based on a dream I had last night. I had written it down to share with a friend and she thought I should post it somewhere. I am not sure if it belongs here? But I’m not sure where it would go if not here. This is also honestly my first time writing a short story like this that wasn’t a school assignment. Please give me feedback if you have any.,t3_kdqk2j
gfy2sci,t1_gfxy6lt,"my biggest gripe is the use of 2nd person -- editing this into close 3rd would make it SO much better. 

other than that, it's a bit ""wtf is going on here"" but I kinda like it. 

also, maaaybe add in to the scare factor somehow, since mods recently complained that some of the stories as of late weren't really scary

all in all: idea is good, but the execution could use some work. 

tip: read a lot of the top stories of all time for practice. ;)",t3_kdqk2j
gfy416a,t1_gfy2sci,"Thank you! I actually got the idea of 2nd person from a book, but rereading I definitely got it mixed up a little. I was hoping it worked with the dream idea. 

For me the scariest part of the dream was when my sisters were being dragged into the tunnel in the ‘laundromat’. It was hard for me to explain but it had become more creepy than before. I think that is part I will work on making it scarier. 
Is it ok to not end as scary? Or should I also add something after the wake up part? I feel like there is imagery in here that would make it hard for me to put into another subreddit so I think best bet is to try to make it scarier. Maybe take out the healing part? Sorry going on and on! And thank you for your comment! I will definitely read  the top stories to get ideas.",t3_kdqk2j
gfy47be,t1_gfy2sci,Am I allowed to edit the story here? Or repost it if it’s changed enough? Would I have to delete this version?,t3_kdqk2j
gfy5uoe,t1_gfy416a,"well, yes, all those seem good ideas. 

a good atmosphere is often enough -- not all stories need to finish with a horror twist. so, focus on that? cut/trim some of the less important parts, and describe in somewhat better detail the scarier ones?

maybe I'd remove the ""I woke up"" part completely. leaving it in a cliffhanger, considering the situation, seems like a great idea ;) 

and honestly, I'd take it down and repost it once edited ;) will get better visibility like that. (I'd also comment saying ""yes I took this down yesterday and reposting now after some heavy editing"" so people don't complain about plagiarism or whatever)

EDIT: with some HEAVY editing (... and definitely minus the ""woke up"" part) it could ift on /r/nosleep, I think.",t3_kdqk2j
gfy7pf4,t1_gfy5uoe,"Thank you again :) 

I wonder how many drafts of this before it is done lol",t3_kdqk2j
gfy9grl,t1_gfy5uoe,Is it ok if I send you a message with the story rewritten and get more feedback?,t3_kdqk2j
gfyfezy,t1_gfy9grl,"sure!

also reminder that you can edit your comments ;)",t3_kdqk2j
