ggb81gp,t1_ggb6kuo,"This story is indeed, well-crafted: kudos OP, for layering a chilling read onto a real disorder of the mind. 

Note, however, to your enthusiastic commenters: 

The stories on here *aren‚Äôt* ‚Äúgarbage.‚Äù As a former NY newspaper columnist, college writing teacher & a writer with a long & varied career, I see it this way: some stories here are from earlier in the writer‚Äôs life, some later... 

... but EVERY writer, no matter how talented, has a lot of rubbish pages to get out of their system to get to the GOLD. :-)

I love (most of) the writer subreddits for being so supportive. Let‚Äôs boost, not bash one another. <3",t3_kfndhk
ggb6w2m,t1_ggb6kuo,Well I'm glad I could give you something not garbage. Can't promise about my other stories though. lol,t3_kfndhk

ggagfr8,t1_ggafzqq,"It must be horrible to ""live""with that, is it even living if you think you're dead?",t3_kfndhk
ggas49d,t1_ggafzqq,Doesn't Vivi Ornitier have that in Final Fantasy IX?,t3_kfndhk
ggalowq,t1_ggaksm9,"Yes but no. I thought the mother would have some mental health condition or something of the sort. The way op made the story was great, but that's why I thought that.",t3_kfndhk
ggb1b40,t1_ggaq57w,I wrote a short story about it myself once back in high school. It typically affects older women and/or after a near-death experience,t3_kfndhk

 Well said.",t3_kfndhk

ggk32os,t1_ggas49d,"Wait, does he? I need to play that game again... lol",t3_kfndhk
ggatt8j,t1_ggalowq,"That's a good way to describe it. It wasn't exactly a twist, but at the same time, it kind of was? Weird way to say it but it's a pretty distinct type of ending.",t3_kfndhk
ggco6ps,t1_ggalowq,"Oh, I'm dumb then cause I just thought she was dead the whole time.",t3_kfndhk
ggb2ort,t1_ggb1b40,"Cool, you should post it on here.",t3_kfndhk
ggax9n4,t1_ggaqd4s,"Yeah stuff like Alzhemiers or Dementia, if I ever get diagnosed with these I will just live out a few days or months with my loved ones and then get ethunaised. I will at least die with happy memories as my last ones, not as a shell of my former self.",t3_kfndhk
ggatzhu,t1_ggatt8j,Yeah it was. It's like the whole story you expect the ending but it could also go differently if that makes some sense,t3_kfndhk
ggcqabj,t1_ggco6ps,"She could have. Just maybe, though",t3_kfndhk
